00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:04.010
No, just incredible, incredible stuff, but this is going to be so exciting.

1
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.780
Game one. We

2
00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:08.630
have selected Blue side and we have to see what they can get done with it.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.010
He won absolutely a terror on red side throughout this event.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.510
And one of the big questions coming in was what is we's

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.229
plan going to be in game number one seeing that they are the underdogs. It already.

6
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.590
We have our answer 100% fakers playing a different champion this time,

7
00:00:24.773 --> 00:00:28.462
this was such a discussion point of would Mid lane be that focus mal

8
00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:30.433
left available, but you have to know R

9
00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:33.193
is available for owner and he has been stellar on it.

10
00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:34.722
There's a lot of options here. Bot

11
00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:36.662
lane focus could be big as well and they're gonna

12
00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:38.763
-- do it right away.
-- And this is the thing.

13
00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.103
The Callister has been such incredible priority.

14
00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:45.292
It was something actually used against T one in the JDG series. And I think RNA

15
00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:49.353
Glas is the most important champion for this series as a whole crisp Inc

16
00:00:49.726 --> 00:00:50.916
on the champion Kerry, of course,

17
00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:54.245
debuting it in their very first game in the Swiss stage at

18
00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:56.715
Worlds So this is very, very important,

19
00:00:56.726 --> 00:01:01.506
-- especially to see what the rest of Webos plan
-- is and not only does it deny crisp,

20
00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:02.305
but we've also seen carrier

21
00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:04.775
himself be extremely successful on this carrier,

22
00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:05.755
Renata

23
00:01:05.986 --> 00:01:07.515
uh or uh Renata Calista ra

24
00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:09.825
are incredibly hard to deal with. It will be the

25
00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:12.986
shy going back to the Atrix, which has to have been the main blind pick. But

26
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.750
in game one pulls

27
00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.080
out is yone

28
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.639
also

29
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.239
shou we'll be playing the chase, meaning we get that

30
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.529
Malka

31
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.550
chase combo that has terrorized the rift all year.

32
00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:25.180
Yeah, this is going to be incredibly exciting getting the yone

33
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.769
here. Game one in the finals. T one getting spicy already.

34
00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:31.550
-- And how is
-- it? Actually

35
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.089
the yone

36
00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.550
P?

37
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.099
That's the

38
00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.599
question

39
00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.300
because Faker has played, I,

40
00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:39.260
I believe he celebrated his 70th unique champion this year.

41
00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:41.569
Um, people have been talking about fake champion po,

42
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.099
it's a really interesting topic, right?

43
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.319
Because we don't know how much he's been practicing recently,

44
00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:47.620
but I think he's played the most champions professionally

45
00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.339
-- out of any other person on the
-- planet.

46
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:52.739
Exactly. I mean, this guy is the consumer professional. He's such a grinder.

47
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.500
He's been back from his injury quite some time.

48
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.180
You have to give him that respect that he can play everything.

49
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.370
It is going to be such a focus down towards bot lane though.

50
00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:01.720
Now, as T one are the ones blinding their bot lane,

51
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.089
they're gonna be banning away the virus.

52
00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.379
The Ash two of those really highly prized picks crisp has been playing more of the

53
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.529
though he's moved towards things like Lux and

54
00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.910
Jer when

55
00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.190
Renato

56
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.050
was gone. So I'm going to be interesting to see where he actually takes us.

57
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:14.970
-- I'm
-- also really big fan of the

58
00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:21.050
Bes here from Weibo because we now have, I think owner's best champions all gone.

59
00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.289
The R

60
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.130
and the J four at the front, but

61
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.509
also was quite strong and taking that away might put owner in a tough situation.

62
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.639
And he has been the player that improved so much throughout or

63
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.729
red from so

64
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.940
to the world championship putting him in uh in a difficult position,

65
00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:42.589
could be a big win as it is the Ari for Faker.

66
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.320
-- So
-- Faker's Ari coming out and it does immediately make you

67
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.380
think could it be a vie as that last pick?

68
00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.419
You know, the, the V Ari

69
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.119
Perry has been so popular throughout the year.

70
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.240
Uh There's also an angle to play like a Poppy or

71
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.710
something like that if we get more dash style champions,

72
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.600
uh coming out from

73
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.899
Webo, but it's gonna be SE

74
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.309
TK just trying to neutralize this bottom line

75
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.130
here

76
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.580
and

77
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.720
this

78
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.880
is

79
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.009
how

80
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.800
it's gonna do.

81
00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.369
-- Yeah, this is
-- something that a lot of people have been talking about as well.

82
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.309
The fact that light and crisp can go back to this style

83
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.320
we've seen already that they can play it to great effect.

84
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:15.389
We'll see what the answer is going to be though, hard engage into the to Kench is, uh,

85
00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.339
something that can be a little bit difficult if it is single target.

86
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.429
So maybe not the vie here and maybe it could

87
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.399
be the Poppy for owner will see where he decides

88
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:23.440
to go. I feel like

89
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.119
could actually be a pretty good answer.

90
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.979
-- All right. Um, well, that is definitely a choice you can
-- make in game number one.

91
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.220
Of course, this is owner's most famous champion by a country mile.

92
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.770
And something that uh for t one was a really big

93
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.039
surprise for me was that when you look at the way that they beat JDG,

94
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.029
it wasn't just with the style of

95
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.190
comps, they actually opted into more team fighting this time around though.

96
00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.559
This comp needs to win in the early game. Faker and owner Guma

97
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.139
carry

98
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.869
out. They need to start stacking dragons.

99
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.339
They need to get ahead early because if you get to,

100
00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:00.363
it's a late game. Look at the front to back on Weibo, right?

101
00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:02.763
This is a composition that's really hard to engage into.

102
00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:05.582
And if t would ever lose map control trying to get on to

103
00:04:06.052 --> 00:04:07.802
Makai, trying to take down individual car, uh,

104
00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.682
targets against the Kench is going to be

105
00:04:09.692 --> 00:04:12.022
-- extremely difficult
-- when you're second to those objectives with

106
00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:14.873
Makai saplings in every brush, you can be getting poked out by the Jays,

107
00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:18.221
which could be difficult, but both teams lacking a little bit as far as the hard

108
00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:18.791
G goes.

109
00:04:18.803 --> 00:04:21.252
But T one does have the ability to pick people off, you know,

110
00:04:21.262 --> 00:04:22.203
with the lease and with the,

111
00:04:22.493 --> 00:04:25.752
with the re they want to be moving around the map, they want to be pushing out lanes,

112
00:04:25.876 --> 00:04:28.915
catching people in transitions, taking these skirmishes

113
00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:33.376
-- as often as they can and we are just moments away from getting onto the rift.
-- Exactly.

114
00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.316
Game number one is upon us.

115
00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.376
Of course, he won a lot of finesse possibilities with a composition like this.

116
00:04:39.385 --> 00:04:39.906
But I look at

117
00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:45.536
Webos draft and I think we've seen these styles of draft so many times in the past.

118
00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:48.735
Staying tried and true as we head onto the rift

119
00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:52.485
for our very first game T one coming out swinging and

120
00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:55.205
Weebo, I think ready to pick up that punch.

121
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.480
See exactly how it is going to go.

122
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.880
World's 2023. Game

123
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.570
-- number one.
-- Let's do it

124
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.029
and all I've got to point out it's triple TP for Webo.

125
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.769
Chris is gonna be taking the tee on that Tom Kench.

126
00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.500
So feeling that they can't get necessarily get

127
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.140
pressured heavily enough to actually get killed.

128
00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:16.420
If he feels he's gonna get chunked out.

129
00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:20.589
Hey, you tee back early, you know, you keep up that farm as much as you possibly can,

130
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.130
but it's gonna give the advantage in playing

131
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.559
that map because they will have that extra T

132
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.920
bo come mid in lake. It,

133
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.410
another thing here is what is the level one

134
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:31.802
to be? I think that one of the other really underrated parts of the SAN

135
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:35.272
-- is how strong the level one is.
-- Exactly right. But just a reminder

136
00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:38.761
to connect your League of Legends account with prime gaming to grab the exclusive

137
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:39.252
W

138
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:42.122
mode. And if you haven't done it already by good, I mean, this is

139
00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:43.731
just do it, just do it now.

140
00:05:44.122 --> 00:05:45.011
-- That would be
-- fantastic.

141
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:45.851
It's a really good

142
00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:46.122
amount

143
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.261
and you saw there as well, no opportunity for,

144
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:49.951
for

145
00:05:50.563 --> 00:05:50.584
we

146
00:05:50.873 --> 00:05:51.813
to use it at least for now,

147
00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:52.324
although

148
00:05:52.664 --> 00:05:52.683
they

149
00:05:52.993 --> 00:05:54.914
might come through. But I do think that the level one of

150
00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:59.623
Weibo is so strong and they are clearly expecting this. So t one I think very smart not

151
00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:00.273
to

152
00:06:00.924 --> 00:06:04.864
-- opt into this and take the risk in game one of the finals and
-- they were pretty good

153
00:06:04.873 --> 00:06:09.473
at utilizing Tom Kench in that level one play if we remember back to it as well.

154
00:06:09.484 --> 00:06:12.114
So certainly no shenanigans this time around

155
00:06:12.354 --> 00:06:12.364
I

156
00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.686
in game number one. That is a good idea f

157
00:06:14.936 --> 00:06:18.466
on his fourth unique champion here for worlds in game number one of the final.

158
00:06:18.476 --> 00:06:21.735
But of course, Ari is one that he's been famous for for many years.

159
00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:24.286
And I think there's gonna be so many eyes on the mid lane because Shau

160
00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:27.895
has not been performing to the level that people were hoping for from him.

161
00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:28.026
You know,

162
00:06:28.036 --> 00:06:29.936
he hasn't been having that incredible tournament but

163
00:06:29.946 --> 00:06:32.555
now here in his first ever world finals,

164
00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:34.506
he's got to step up if it's gonna be, we

165
00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:34.936
win.

166
00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.846
Exactly. Well, piercing darkness

167
00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:40.196
coming through there from light.

168
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.079
Not too much.

169
00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:43.630
Just a little bit of a tussle,

170
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.880
a little bit of checking each other on the bottom side

171
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.220
of the map as fake are now trying to push forward.

172
00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.359
Shau

173
00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:49.019
just

174
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.859
-- having an OK time here as the chase into
-- the A E

175
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.480
And we'll see, uh if we're going to see Ambre

176
00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:56.480
where we're going to see the early jungle attention.

177
00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:58.290
Because I think for T one obviously,

178
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.679
self-explanatory dragons and Heralds are incredibly important to pick up early,

179
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.559
but there is an opportunity to try and go for these aggressive plays.

180
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.420
I think Weiwei in particular has been really

181
00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:09.980
good about consistently finding bottom line angles.

182
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.450
Uh Although he is currently passing towards, but we'll see how T one can cover for Z

183
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.730
because he is already shoving in.

184
00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.989
And if you can get an early kill on the yone, it can really send the behind.

185
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.299
Well, an owner is going to use this to

186
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.440
a right. He's going to win this duel against Weiwei.

187
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.899
So he's just gonna try to get right in his face, push him out.

188
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.779
He knows he has that pushing top lane

189
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.790
and we'll see how this fight does go.

190
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.070
-- Yeah,
-- nice little side step there to avoid the Sonic wave

191
00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.660
Weiwei just making sure that he can keep that health

192
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.809
bar high has actually popped the potion there as well.

193
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.880
It's a sapling in the brushes own it just looking to try and

194
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.000
wreak havoc.

195
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.589
-- But
-- look at

196
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.760
Zeus Z

197
00:07:44.049 --> 00:07:44.890
is already moving down.

198
00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:48.220
That's why he starts the camp now because Zeus got the push in. He's gonna come down.

199
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.079
So we we is gonna have to back off.

200
00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:53.119
He could look for the 5050 but he risks putting himself in danger.

201
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.559
So it should be owner grabbing the wolf and they can continue this pressure on.

202
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.959
You can look towards mid now

203
00:07:58.109 --> 00:07:58.250
and show

204
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.440
-- is in trouble.
-- Owner immediately moves over.

205
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.170
There's the flex accuses going to land from Moa

206
00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:05.200
but he decides to not go in under the inner torrent and shau

207
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:07.312
-- to try and fire
-- back.

208
00:08:07.321 --> 00:08:10.712
This is just great stuff early on here from T one owner,

209
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:13.661
three camps top moves into the enemy jungle to cover

210
00:08:13.881 --> 00:08:15.391
Zeus on the push then uses

211
00:08:15.502 --> 00:08:16.571
Zeus's pressure to move down.

212
00:08:16.582 --> 00:08:19.201
Steal the wolves rotates over towards mid where faker

213
00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:21.312
has that now into a bots side scuttle.

214
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.671
This is really clean,

215
00:08:22.682 --> 00:08:25.921
really well preplanned play here from T one and

216
00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:27.502
I'm gonna be looking towards how would a jungler

217
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:29.131
-- is able to punish the
-- elect

218
00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:29.342
of

219
00:08:30.372 --> 00:08:31.861
w is fake against the job.

220
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:32.291
He's

221
00:08:32.563 --> 00:08:34.664
listen to this guys, but I don't think it's going to be enough

222
00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:34.953
because his

223
00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:38.703
flash, it's already down and first blood goes to

224
00:08:38.874 --> 00:08:38.914
Yahoo

225
00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:41.823
-- and
-- I haven't even finished my center. So Weiwei does.

226
00:08:41.832 --> 00:08:46.504
That exact thing punishes faker for being dead far up in the lane

227
00:08:46.513 --> 00:08:49.684
-- and all they gave up for it was a wolf
-- camp and we said

228
00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:52.804
Yahoo had to have a good series, had to have a good game.

229
00:08:52.814 --> 00:08:56.383
And what better start than a first blood on the Spring

230
00:08:56.393 --> 00:08:59.143
King from the LP L in his first world final.

231
00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:01.676
And you mentioned it already. Chronicler

232
00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:03.846
Xu is a guy that's had a lot of attention from a

233
00:09:03.856 --> 00:09:07.416
lot of fans and already starting to silence some of those doubts,

234
00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:08.015
but it is very,

235
00:09:08.026 --> 00:09:10.015
very early days in this one as we check

236
00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:11.955
out the replay really good popping here from Weiwei.

237
00:09:12.226 --> 00:09:14.895
Yeah, this is just great from Weiwei just wraps around, you know,

238
00:09:14.906 --> 00:09:16.875
did skip that top side scuttle and I think

239
00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:19.065
Ficker potentially thought he was actually over on.

240
00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:21.075
It just comes right down pass immediately.

241
00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:23.656
There is not gonna be able to get out as faker committed.

242
00:09:23.666 --> 00:09:25.346
The flash for that trade earlier on Yahoo.

243
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.270
And if you think back to the spring final or summer finals,

244
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.039
rather that t one wasn't able to win,

245
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.840
it was in large part because

246
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.530
Jenji identified if you get Fager off of some of his conference

247
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.320
champions and you put him down early by a lot of repeated jungle attention.

248
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.510
It can be a viable way to get an early to mid game lead against

249
00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:45.369
Ian and we've seen that they can struggle in

250
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.960
that situation and particularly with draft like this,

251
00:09:47.969 --> 00:09:51.960
you need to win, you can't try and uh kind of go through the middle, you know, maybe

252
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.539
-- pick up a Dragon or two. No, you need to be able to dominate from the Get Go. And
-- Ari pre

253
00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:59.179
six is one of those champions that you really can take advantage of.

254
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.640
You know, that is why a year was so key 41 in their playoff run.

255
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.239
And Wei Wei, it's interesting to note that it was that first

256
00:10:05.359 --> 00:10:07.909
GK in towards mid, you know, he has been so

257
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.919
heavily prioritizing these box side

258
00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.380
GKS throughout worlds

259
00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:12.450
in the LP L.

260
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.210
It was much more about playing towards the shy, but at worlds,

261
00:10:15.219 --> 00:10:17.890
it has been about playing towards Chris playing towards light

262
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.340
and I really wanted to see what his game plan was gonna

263
00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:23.450
be coming into worlds because clearly t one movie prep for that.

264
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.390
-- Well,
-- owner gonna clear out some vision as you can see Control Ward in the Drake pit.

265
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.929
First one going to be a Kench

266
00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:32.119
Drake and owner is going to very happily join

267
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.979
carrier as they look to take this one down.

268
00:10:33.989 --> 00:10:35.960
So at about six minutes into the game,

269
00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:38.739
we will have our very first dragon Baker coming on over,

270
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.960
not gonna be able to steal anything away,

271
00:10:39.969 --> 00:10:42.409
just getting some information here for T one.

272
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.510
So they will be able to secure this dragon.

273
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.320
So that is one of the steps that they have taken here

274
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:48.340
still,

275
00:10:48.349 --> 00:10:50.690
they're gonna need those big advantages like you guys were

276
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.190
talking about in order to make this one work.

277
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.500
Looking here towards the bottom side, Gui

278
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.780
has a huge advantage over the Tom Kench.

279
00:10:56.859 --> 00:10:58.179
But something that you would expect,

280
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.369
-- it's not necessarily a lane you can really judge on
-- C si mean,

281
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.719
you can see it in both top and bot

282
00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:05.409
lane though. You know, these CS differences obviously is the Tom Ken

283
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.989
versus that Calista not comparing it with the center, uh,

284
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.479
but both top and bot

285
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.859
significant CS advantages

286
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.390
already here. 41 mid, slightly favored towards faker.

287
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.299
Despite the death,

288
00:11:15.309 --> 00:11:17.909
they are out farming their opponents and that's why they're still at

289
00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.219
this slight amount of goal despite giving up that first blood.

290
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.289
-- And this is
-- something we

291
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.820
was also able to do. Uh

292
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:23.390
the

293
00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:24.700
shy specifically against been,

294
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.330
was able to use the fact that the matchup was isolated to push really heavily for

295
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:33.409
Big CS leads and then take those leads into mid game fights and carry them.

296
00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:34.419
-- And when we talk
-- about com

297
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.179
that are relying on these early game advantages.

298
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.219
One of the ways you can do it is just by stacking dragons, you're playing Calista,

299
00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:43.780
you're gonna have f side pressure even if you can't establish a massive goal lead.

300
00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:47.330
If you take these early dragons and put the pressure of that soul on your opponents,

301
00:11:47.469 --> 00:11:49.719
you circumvent a lot of the weaknesses and hard engage

302
00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:51.809
that your composition has you draw your opponents to you,

303
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.260
you force them to challenge you at these dragons where you are gonna be

304
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.940
set up for that fight where you are gonna be in the advantage.

305
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.130
Alright, now it is just a bit of trading in lanes where we're gonna go home,

306
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.059
collect himself, uh, a book and a control ward.

307
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.929
Try to get back to it as Chris the tongue lash,

308
00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.419
it hurts a whole lot more.

309
00:12:09.429 --> 00:12:12.890
Uh I feel like when uh you've got him sitting in a lane by himself for quite some time,

310
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.799
but he's actually still just level five, same as everybody else

311
00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:16.809
and

312
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.570
Gushi still playing aggressively, not able to land too many of these pierces as

313
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.710
uh Zeus's soul is relatively unbound as he

314
00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:27.799
just keeps shoving these weights relentlessly into the

315
00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:28.739
Shire's turret.

316
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.280
First plate has gone down already here for T one like you were mentioning as they

317
00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:36.359
are playing into the advantages in gold that has now ticked up to about 500.

318
00:12:36.669 --> 00:12:40.400
And my expectation is that T one is going to use this top lane prior

319
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.976
to secure Harold without too much difficulty. Faker. Almost we

320
00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:45.065
flash available.

321
00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:45.375
Xu

322
00:12:45.515 --> 00:12:47.135
already has his. But with this

323
00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:48.426
ax being Perma pushed in,

324
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:51.825
it should make the set up 41 around this objective pretty easy.

325
00:12:51.926 --> 00:12:54.585
And they have also already rotated over Guma

326
00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:55.416
Yushi and Kara.

327
00:12:55.676 --> 00:12:57.195
So they are going to secure this.

328
00:12:57.205 --> 00:12:58.616
Then my question becomes,

329
00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:00.216
where are they going to throw it down because

330
00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:02.236
the two obvious solutions to me would be either

331
00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:03.145
Zeus or Guma.

332
00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:05.926
Obviously Guma already massively far ahead. But a yone

333
00:13:06.176 --> 00:13:08.125
in a side lane I think is one of the

334
00:13:08.135 --> 00:13:10.265
biggest things that Weibo might not be able to answer.

335
00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:10.702
I

336
00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:12.142
think it should go towards

337
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:13.421
Zeus. He already has the push.

338
00:13:13.432 --> 00:13:16.512
This is one of these hyperscale top laner that he already has the early push.

339
00:13:16.521 --> 00:13:17.992
You can harass those towers, harass the A

340
00:13:18.122 --> 00:13:21.031
rocks with the soul unbound and you get him that big gold lead.

341
00:13:21.041 --> 00:13:24.221
This guy can make miracles happen in a five V five

342
00:13:24.632 --> 00:13:28.952
-- Z has been simply incredible throughout the world championship.
-- Certainly has.

343
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:30.971
-- And now Baker
-- is gonna dash in fights. The

344
00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:31.161
chal

345
00:13:31.322 --> 00:13:31.952
on to the Tom

346
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:32.481
C

347
00:13:32.622 --> 00:13:33.711
fake has to get out of there though.

348
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:34.151
C

349
00:13:34.351 --> 00:13:36.471
the hostile takeover gets so much work done. The

350
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:37.721
De Denver that kills them.

351
00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:38.419
Oh, no,

352
00:13:39.989 --> 00:13:40.219
it's B

353
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.239
dashes forward once again.

354
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.099
-- But it looks like they'll have to settle for one and a Herald
-- and

355
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.789
Webo, they see that T one is at the Herald.

356
00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:50.650
They rotate over and I think they try to recuperate,

357
00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:54.190
but that's uh song gonna cause fallacy because they just walk up.

358
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.239
T one finds the angle and Webo

359
00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:59.530
-- give up the Herald and kill
-- Exactly.

360
00:13:59.539 --> 00:14:02.289
And maybe gonna lose some form down on bots side as well. Cos Chris has no TV. But

361
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.119
Natures

362
00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:03.369
Cross

363
00:14:03.469 --> 00:14:06.455
comes in, he gets pulled back. He's interrupted from the ultimate, he

364
00:14:06.606 --> 00:14:08.205
does get a knock up there and a shield,

365
00:14:08.216 --> 00:14:11.375
but I think he's still dead and there it is the answering kill from the shwa

366
00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:14.625
-- able to punch
-- back on the top side.

367
00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:18.375
You can see owner hanging around that bottom side, potentially threatening as Guma

368
00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:22.435
and carry are going to push it in already have taken a plate themselves down there.

369
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:26.335
But great he back on the top side does help to equalize the gold there for the shot.

370
00:14:26.596 --> 00:14:28.835
-- Yeah, go
-- now actually completely fine.

371
00:14:28.846 --> 00:14:31.512
The shot might even be able to pick up played as well. And crucially,

372
00:14:31.692 --> 00:14:31.781
Zais

373
00:14:32.052 --> 00:14:35.961
doesn't have TP so actually is going to lose out on this wave,

374
00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:37.831
unlike Faker when he was ganged earlier, who

375
00:14:37.952 --> 00:14:40.361
is TP back to the lane not going to be the case here.

376
00:14:40.372 --> 00:14:43.361
And that is the second time that Weibo, the initial play might not work,

377
00:14:43.372 --> 00:14:44.841
but Weiwei pulls it back.

378
00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:45.692
Exactly. And

379
00:14:45.892 --> 00:14:48.611
just couldn't use that ultimate quite fast enough, you know.

380
00:14:48.622 --> 00:14:51.601
So we we was able to get ahead of him blocks the Al T and then from that point, Ze

381
00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:55.062
says, you know what, I'm dead either way. So I'm gonna hold on to the flash, but

382
00:14:55.409 --> 00:14:59.239
it is an unfortunate death for him as he had so much pressure on top side,

383
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.390
so much tempo and a lot of that is gonna be lost now but

384
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.780
not lost in the mid lane where Faker has continued to push in.

385
00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:10.059
Continued this relentless aggression here despite being that first death,

386
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.729
even though he did pull down first up faker is

387
00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:15.479
pretty good at bouncing back from uh initial deaths.

388
00:15:15.489 --> 00:15:17.799
The global taunt that he's had for the last 10 years

389
00:15:17.905 --> 00:15:18.984
seems to be the thing,

390
00:15:19.145 --> 00:15:19.705
the most GED

391
00:15:19.905 --> 00:15:22.044
-- man of all time, I
-- think it's probably true,

392
00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:24.275
but also he's played lot like the most games

393
00:15:24.284 --> 00:15:27.005
out of anyone else uh that still plays currently.

394
00:15:27.015 --> 00:15:27.445
So,

395
00:15:27.734 --> 00:15:31.755
um it's, it's a, it's a weird stat uh to go towards bottom side of the map,

396
00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.825
we do see a reset coming through here for

397
00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:34.645
Gushi and

398
00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:34.965
Krier.

399
00:15:35.304 --> 00:15:37.844
Not quite towards the first item yet for the Calista,

400
00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.354
which would be pretty important for the next fight coming up,

401
00:15:40.969 --> 00:15:42.330
-- see what they can get
-- for themselves.

402
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.799
Yeah, you see as well already,

403
00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:46.710
Weibo is moving up the second Drake I think is really pivotal.

404
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.549
Uh There are a lot of good tricks still available for T one. No

405
00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.260
C tech uh Dragon in particular.

406
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.320
What Drake? It's gonna be, it's T one,

407
00:15:53.859 --> 00:15:55.299
it's cloud, it's got to be the cloud.

408
00:15:55.599 --> 00:15:56.429
They've got the most cloud.

409
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.900
You don't want them to have clouds. So,

410
00:15:59.109 --> 00:16:02.210
uh particularly not with the amount of ability on the team. So I think that

411
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.440
Weibo is going to try and contest there,

412
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.710
but T one still are the ones with control of their pots.

413
00:16:07.719 --> 00:16:08.119
Side pro

414
00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:11.669
is now being found by light and crisp Harold being

415
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:14.489
placed down just in mid lane to try and pressure

416
00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:16.890
Webo out and get a quick move into the river.

417
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.530
It's going to mean that that dragon should belong to

418
00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:21.400
T one if they can get control with it.

419
00:16:21.479 --> 00:16:21.500
F

420
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.039
it sticking around for the cash

421
00:16:23.489 --> 00:16:25.000
and we will be able to gather it here.

422
00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.830
All the deception gonna go wide and it looks like F

423
00:16:26.979 --> 00:16:28.820
is not gonna stick around for another plate

424
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:29.630
as we, we

425
00:16:29.869 --> 00:16:32.080
gone for reset, they're gonna give up the second Drake as well.

426
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.179
-- Yeah,
-- I think there's just no real angle for them to contest from this point.

427
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.830
Owner dropped the Herald Mid, they get

428
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.890
there, they reestablished Ryo down on that bottom.

429
00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:40.625
I move up through the river

430
00:16:40.955 --> 00:16:41.835
and with Carrie Guma,

431
00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:44.426
it's such a strong point early on in the game,

432
00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:45.806
it is gonna be cloud

433
00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:46.125
salt.

434
00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:50.466
-- It's
-- not a question mark. I uh I did tell you, I, I informed you, I didn't

435
00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:54.245
-- pose a question. Well,
-- Atlas, I, I always want to believe

436
00:16:54.366 --> 00:16:55.745
that you're right about dragons

437
00:16:56.026 --> 00:16:58.596
and the guys are clouds. I gotta say you often are.

438
00:16:58.676 --> 00:17:00.666
-- And
-- do you know who was actually the one that

439
00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:03.492
told me that my love of clouds was actually OK.

440
00:17:03.502 --> 00:17:04.421
It was uh it was

441
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:07.131
Azal as Chris is taking some damage here towards the bottom side.

442
00:17:07.352 --> 00:17:10.051
-- It's all
-- I've always been a cloud believer. Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:17:10.171 --> 00:17:10.452
Yeah.

444
00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:12.692
Move speed turns out pretty good. Uh

445
00:17:13.182 --> 00:17:14.521
It's a pretty good step and Isaiah is

446
00:17:14.732 --> 00:17:16.982
not going to uh he's actually gonna utilize some

447
00:17:16.991 --> 00:17:18.862
move speed to move out of the infernal chains.

448
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:19.332
Look at that

449
00:17:20.112 --> 00:17:21.411
proving your point immediately. A

450
00:17:23.218 --> 00:17:25.489
our owner is here though. It's going to be a two B two Z

451
00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:27.239
-- taking a bit of damage as the queue comes down to
-- E

452
00:17:27.348 --> 00:17:27.438
the

453
00:17:27.698 --> 00:17:28.178
ti he

454
00:17:28.428 --> 00:17:28.609
gra

455
00:17:28.749 --> 00:17:31.958
but look at the knock up the kick back. We, we punches him out of

456
00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:32.229
hole.

457
00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:33.159
Shadow

458
00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:33.479
play

459
00:17:33.588 --> 00:17:35.718
through to help get the kill on to

460
00:17:36.168 --> 00:17:37.759
ZZ. It looked good for T one and

461
00:17:37.889 --> 00:17:41.369
-- Webos struck back and light saves
-- the play. T

462
00:17:42.088 --> 00:17:45.418
one made the call before Zeus is back to all in on

463
00:17:45.785 --> 00:17:45.905
silly

464
00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:46.334
the Malka

465
00:17:46.805 --> 00:17:50.375
just finished his demonic embrace. Weiwei is able to stay alive.

466
00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:53.145
Life keeps him there and a big win for Weibo,

467
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.214
-- they thought they
-- could punish the missing flash that had been

468
00:17:55.224 --> 00:17:57.375
spent as Kerry are looking for an angle won't find it.

469
00:17:57.385 --> 00:17:59.114
They wanted to be able to burst him down. Faker

470
00:18:00.385 --> 00:18:02.295
-- does
-- come through fox fire coming down,

471
00:18:02.305 --> 00:18:04.704
but they do have to invest the ultimate faker

472
00:18:04.714 --> 00:18:06.685
now not gonna have that for the next play.

473
00:18:06.694 --> 00:18:07.275
And that's what Shau

474
00:18:07.484 --> 00:18:07.875
wanted.

475
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:09.689
I

476
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:10.979
want to see now

477
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:11.510
the shot

478
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.170
getting more and more ahead.

479
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.770
Now in that top lane has taken a couple of places

480
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.719
does have to kill in the assist for Drinker completed.

481
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:18.819
Tier two boots done

482
00:18:19.229 --> 00:18:22.219
says with that big farm lead is still keeping things relatively even.

483
00:18:22.229 --> 00:18:24.489
But both those scraps on the top side have gone way

484
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:24.880
way.

485
00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:25.670
And again,

486
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.829
we wait to me has been the crucial factory 100% co participation thus

487
00:18:29.839 --> 00:18:33.540
far able to make sure that t one doesn't get that momentum.

488
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.400
No, I don't think that

489
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.650
one particularly with the dragon stacking is necessarily in grave danger,

490
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.920
but this means that the gold stays on parity that Weibo still gets to scale

491
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.489
into that mid to late game where it can be incredibly impressive to into as the

492
00:18:46.969 --> 00:18:47.839
shi might be getting

493
00:18:47.979 --> 00:18:48.040
GED.

494
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.920
-- Yeah,
-- Kerry is gonna move on up here as

495
00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:50.099
Z

496
00:18:50.239 --> 00:18:51.449
is gonna break those chains.

497
00:18:51.459 --> 00:18:53.780
-- Kerry is looking for that
-- handshake angle as already the

498
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.939
shi has done a fair bit of damage but I

499
00:18:54.949 --> 00:18:56.810
don't think it is going to be enough as it's

500
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.949
-- Alco gaming
-- for the shy and he will go down owner

501
00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.680
-- that kill
-- owner.

502
00:19:00.689 --> 00:19:03.890
Nice kill on the top side if two doesn't work, bring three,

503
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.040
bring another guy car on the room up to

504
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.790
top side wasn't really expected. I think

505
00:19:08.979 --> 00:19:09.959
to be up there.

506
00:19:09.969 --> 00:19:12.479
The sh thought he was going to be safe but now dieing there

507
00:19:12.489 --> 00:19:15.319
with no TP does mean there's gonna be a pretty big push.

508
00:19:15.329 --> 00:19:18.089
You can see Guma, of course you have to carry, compare that with Chris

509
00:19:18.369 --> 00:19:21.339
brings him back in with the twisted advances, the kick back as well as we

510
00:19:21.439 --> 00:19:22.760
we gets out the punch and now show

511
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.939
coming on it

512
00:19:24.869 --> 00:19:27.680
down and no bail out for you lights in a bit of trouble, but the J

513
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.500
is not gonna get it done because Crisp is there with the den,

514
00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:32.410
the denial with the devour

515
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.400
-- and he won't have to run away. What a
-- play from Webo

516
00:19:35.819 --> 00:19:38.160
and continuously they are getting out skirmish.

517
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:38.569
We

518
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.829
we

519
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.130
should be able to get the execute here

520
00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.550
so nothing given up

521
00:19:44.209 --> 00:19:44.780
and Webo

522
00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:45.969
walk away. Victoria

523
00:19:46.194 --> 00:19:46.675
again. We

524
00:19:46.864 --> 00:19:49.525
has just had such an incredible journey as a player.

525
00:19:49.535 --> 00:19:53.895
You know, this guy first starting on V five came in with them, played with BLG.

526
00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:55.025
And since joining

527
00:19:55.185 --> 00:19:58.734
Webo has made such a difference with this team has really transformed,

528
00:19:58.744 --> 00:20:03.055
the team has such good pressure in the early stages and him getting going early

529
00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:05.035
always spells good things for this team

530
00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:07.135
certainly does. Let's have a look at the play one more time.

531
00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:11.454
And as we look here, initially, it looks like t one wants to back off the way

532
00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:14.685
goes very far back, but then crucially

533
00:20:15.069 --> 00:20:16.569
barely stays alive, right?

534
00:20:16.579 --> 00:20:18.959
And with him getting away, there is no bailout value for owner.

535
00:20:18.969 --> 00:20:21.530
And the fact that faker t he's in doesn't matter

536
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.119
-- because Chris is standing at the ready with
-- Theo.

537
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.089
Chris was there and light with some nice little sidesteps.

538
00:20:27.099 --> 00:20:28.310
Don't think the charm would have mattered even if

539
00:20:28.319 --> 00:20:30.390
it landed because Chris was right behind him,

540
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:30.729
but

541
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.260
well played on the sidestep.

542
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.760
Nonetheless, he won though continually going towards these objectives,

543
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.439
they know they need to keep pushing the pace and Webo here looking to challenge

544
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:39.829
and

545
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:44.109
nice shot blast is going to soften up T one just a little bit here. Four versus three.

546
00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:44.900
In this moment, the F

547
00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:47.069
is wrapping around from the top side of the fight. The

548
00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.550
shi pretty far away from this one and

549
00:20:49.689 --> 00:20:51.199
-- Zeus is moving in, gets
-- over the wall.

550
00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:51.680
There's the old,

551
00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:55.880
-- it's going to be dodge as he gets himself out of there
-- with the unbound soul and T one,

552
00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.339
-- they are gonna be able to secure the Herald forces the
-- flash from

553
00:20:58.349 --> 00:21:01.150
light and they get the Herald really nicely done from T one.

554
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.760
That is what has been going their way all game long.

555
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.800
And now I'm wondering, can t one also get themselves to this dragon in time?

556
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.354
I think just have enough time to still get the backs in, make their way,

557
00:21:11.364 --> 00:21:15.175
spend their money and then try and set up this sole point very early on.

558
00:21:15.185 --> 00:21:16.775
Because while when it comes to Gold

559
00:21:16.974 --> 00:21:19.074
Webo has been able to stay very relevant,

560
00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:20.035
if T

561
00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:20.795
one picked this up,

562
00:21:20.805 --> 00:21:24.645
they will have got every single objective thus far and it will

563
00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:28.094
at the very least force Weibo to maybe make some tough decisions.

564
00:21:28.104 --> 00:21:30.255
Once say is in the sideline becomes hard to deal with because I

565
00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:32.354
-- wouldn't be surprised if he ends up going for whole breaker
-- again.

566
00:21:32.364 --> 00:21:36.395
And this is such an early sole point that they will be moving to the third dragon here.

567
00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:40.689
If they can get it around 17, 17.5 minutes into the game

568
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.459
and threatening that 22 23 minutes soul would be a really tough spot here for

569
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.089
Webo. So they have to get mid lane control.

570
00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:49.550
They have to be able to push this out then move into the river.

571
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.520
They want to be first to the scene. You can see we, we trying to keep these

572
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.530
down and ra

573
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.339
one as they try to move in. But in the bot lane, it's Zeus with the push there.

574
00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:58.780
And if he can get prior down to that Bo

575
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.780
side, they can potentially set up a flank from multiple angles.

576
00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:04.589
Owner should be able to put the Herald down here as well to help them get that mid,

577
00:22:05.045 --> 00:22:06.944
get towards that dragon. But you can see we

578
00:22:07.185 --> 00:22:09.204
don't want to give up the river right now.

579
00:22:09.635 --> 00:22:09.854
Weiwei

580
00:22:10.084 --> 00:22:11.564
just standing stalwart.

581
00:22:11.765 --> 00:22:11.854
The sh

582
00:22:12.035 --> 00:22:13.964
is going to turn up charm is going to connect,

583
00:22:13.974 --> 00:22:16.265
but faker probably not wanting to go in on that one.

584
00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:19.844
If you're gonna connect from owner and Ti One just keeping up this pressure

585
00:22:20.025 --> 00:22:20.785
allowing

586
00:22:20.895 --> 00:22:20.944
HBO

587
00:22:21.114 --> 00:22:24.484
to move into that river knowing they have Zeus very close

588
00:22:24.494 --> 00:22:26.785
to that bottom wave to keep pressure in the lane.

589
00:22:26.795 --> 00:22:29.305
Exactly is threatened. Moving up. He went, just did the gram.

590
00:22:29.364 --> 00:22:31.984
Now he's down back towards that bottom lane, pushing that out.

591
00:22:31.994 --> 00:22:33.979
So forcing the response from the shy

592
00:22:34.329 --> 00:22:35.630
you want are happy in this stalemate.

593
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.140
Position right now, they still have the Herald to work with. So if we

594
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.640
over commit towards the dragon,

595
00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.949
they can just drop Harold mid and guarantee that's your one.

596
00:22:42.489 --> 00:22:45.619
-- He is going to
-- miss the handshake, but the cue is gonna land from ona.

597
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.369
We, we

598
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.420
could avoid it with a twisted advance on not going to go in as he ever cross,

599
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.319
he gets the devour

600
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.579
Gushi, getting himself out of there and

601
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.489
utilizing his ultimate to save carrier as well.

602
00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.550
-- But that is so many cool downs
-- and now we

603
00:22:58.819 --> 00:22:59.859
started off the Drake. We

604
00:23:00.119 --> 00:23:01.449
might be looking to go for it. They've

605
00:23:01.555 --> 00:23:04.854
also used a number of cool thumbs themselves, most notably the Shy and

606
00:23:05.145 --> 00:23:08.375
Weber's ultimate. We'll see if T one tries to go for an alternative play.

607
00:23:08.385 --> 00:23:10.135
Just push mid, but it looks like

608
00:23:10.364 --> 00:23:12.175
-- Weel isn't even gonna give them the
-- opportunity as, oh

609
00:23:12.305 --> 00:23:12.484
no

610
00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:12.864
man

611
00:23:13.025 --> 00:23:13.724
to keep flash

612
00:23:13.824 --> 00:23:13.844
show

613
00:23:13.954 --> 00:23:15.555
who's gonna be pushed into

614
00:23:15.775 --> 00:23:18.125
big of the flash ball. But the charm he's going to miss what?

615
00:23:18.405 --> 00:23:18.425
He

616
00:23:18.625 --> 00:23:19.415
doesn't let it show,

617
00:23:19.555 --> 00:23:20.795
just walks it off.

618
00:23:20.905 --> 00:23:24.035
No worries there at all. As crisp is under the turret they throw to

619
00:23:24.214 --> 00:23:24.324
Ar

620
00:23:24.484 --> 00:23:24.775
Butan

621
00:23:24.954 --> 00:23:29.755
has found two with the ultimate light goes down so low, but isn't going to

622
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.469
five Weiwei trying to get himself out of there and the shy is given

623
00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:37.810
up on Weiwei running the wrong direction but they at least get the dragon

624
00:23:38.569 --> 00:23:41.439
Weibo, get the dragon but t one get the kill. Shau

625
00:23:41.719 --> 00:23:46.030
lucky to get out of that one. But Weiwei, he's going home in the body bag.

626
00:23:47.089 --> 00:23:49.500
That is the final kill there from owner

627
00:23:49.989 --> 00:23:52.060
and that is the first fight that t one have won.

628
00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:53.719
But they've lost that dragon stacking that

629
00:23:53.729 --> 00:23:55.640
you were talking about earlier chronicler.

630
00:23:55.979 --> 00:23:58.910
And so we'll see whether they can grab that next one and keep this level of

631
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.780
pressure up because 2.3000 gold is that enough

632
00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.560
-- of a lead for this early game
-- composition.

633
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.449
And there is a reason why owners Lee has been fixed.

634
00:24:07.666 --> 00:24:10.706
And the funniest part to me is this play doesn't even matter because Shau

635
00:24:10.895 --> 00:24:12.895
actually is able to walk it up.

636
00:24:12.906 --> 00:24:17.286
Another miraculous survival faker doesn't get the chase because of Chris.

637
00:24:17.365 --> 00:24:18.416
But then it's Zeus

638
00:24:18.745 --> 00:24:23.426
-- who got put down in lane that makes the hero play
-- exactly comes in on the other side.

639
00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:27.206
There's no devour because Chris was over saving his mid,

640
00:24:27.326 --> 00:24:32.621
trying to defend there. So light is left vulnerable and light is punished big time.

641
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:34.802
T one getting that major gold injection.

642
00:24:34.812 --> 00:24:36.921
And, and you can see a lot of these towers that they've been pressing.

643
00:24:36.962 --> 00:24:40.092
If you look on live faker taking down that top tier one,

644
00:24:40.102 --> 00:24:41.862
a lot of these turrets have been getting lower

645
00:24:41.871 --> 00:24:44.511
and lower from this T one lane dominance.

646
00:24:44.702 --> 00:24:48.511
-- Yeah, you can
-- see there's a lot of relief on Tom's face there as well

647
00:24:49.189 --> 00:24:51.969
hoping that t one can get this mid game sorted out.

648
00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:55.479
Owner stealing away some raptors, full vision given over to

649
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.170
Webo 3.5 minutes on the clock when it comes to

650
00:24:58.469 --> 00:25:01.209
the uh Drake. As in goes,

651
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:01.579
Zaius

652
00:25:01.859 --> 00:25:01.939
Shou

653
00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:05.290
just uh bots him away and owner is gonna come through as well. Shahu

654
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.270
in still a lot of trouble.

655
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.719
Safeguard comes in. Shau

656
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.199
-- moving
-- away from the lease

657
00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:13.000
to the skies, comes down. The devourer is there.

658
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:16.020
It was crisp coming forward and he saves his mid line

659
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.609
up. But that is

660
00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:18.983
-- lot invested. That's
-- the problem is that even though Xu

661
00:25:19.272 --> 00:25:20.142
makes it out alive,

662
00:25:20.152 --> 00:25:23.383
crisp uses TP and they're not even going to be able to save deterrent.

663
00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:24.392
So even though

664
00:25:24.662 --> 00:25:26.322
isn't able to actually clip

665
00:25:26.503 --> 00:25:26.532
Xiao

666
00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:28.223
who he sidesteps the ultimate,

667
00:25:28.233 --> 00:25:31.542
it's still a big win and the whole breaker is in fact

668
00:25:31.552 --> 00:25:34.353
done and it makes him such a menace in the sideline.

669
00:25:34.422 --> 00:25:36.942
-- Exactly.
-- It's incredibly difficult to deal with them.

670
00:25:36.983 --> 00:25:39.902
They become incredibly tanky and one of the most underrated parts

671
00:25:39.912 --> 00:25:41.922
about this is how tan it actually makes the Canon minions.

672
00:25:41.932 --> 00:25:44.142
They become very difficult to actually wave clear out a lot,

673
00:25:46.145 --> 00:25:48.875
-- be
-- in a bit of trouble here as Chris looks for it,

674
00:25:48.885 --> 00:25:51.026
the immediate cleanse does get out of the way.

675
00:25:51.036 --> 00:25:53.745
-- Nature's
-- cross isn't gonna connect, but there is the twisted even hostile

676
00:25:54.125 --> 00:25:57.556
takeover across everyone over the shy. It's just gigantic gua

677
00:25:57.735 --> 00:26:00.375
trying to hop away, defeats all the knock

678
00:26:00.556 --> 00:26:01.625
ups. And meanwhile, we

679
00:26:01.765 --> 00:26:01.865
we

680
00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:05.115
is going down Baker collects it before bowling down.

681
00:26:05.125 --> 00:26:07.696
Chris has to go though because he's so incredibly low

682
00:26:07.845 --> 00:26:08.245
and say

683
00:26:08.546 --> 00:26:10.465
is tearing them to shreds.

684
00:26:10.615 --> 00:26:11.026
We

685
00:26:11.196 --> 00:26:11.625
O LA

686
00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:12.670
oh,

687
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.619
now is t one look to tidy up Chris and

688
00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.040
they won that team fight even better than the loss.

689
00:26:18.339 --> 00:26:20.349
-- Guma refuses to
-- go down.

690
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.339
Kia saves him. Coming in with a

691
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.209
-- will take over a T one. They're on
-- the Baron and it's Renada

692
00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:27.750
-- that
-- does it again. Kia

693
00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:30.500
standing at the ready keeps Guma

694
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.369
alive throughout all of it.

695
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.569
And T one, the goal before this was even Weel

696
00:26:36.729 --> 00:26:38.790
picked up the dragon. But after this fight,

697
00:26:38.979 --> 00:26:43.079
multiple goal, uh kills going over the T one barn secured

698
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.040
and it looks like the first game might have

699
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:47.770
been broken open the early get comp getting it done

700
00:26:48.349 --> 00:26:51.520
and here is the replay. We'll see how it all started. It looked like a pick on the

701
00:26:51.859 --> 00:26:54.969
-- Gushi. It
-- did but it just took them so long to actually get to him.

702
00:26:54.979 --> 00:26:58.810
You can see everyone from T one is coming as fast as they possibly can.

703
00:26:58.819 --> 00:27:01.180
And all the time that was bought here by Guma

704
00:27:01.369 --> 00:27:02.729
allows them to arrive,

705
00:27:02.739 --> 00:27:05.849
allows the hostile takeover here hitting across multiple members.

706
00:27:05.859 --> 00:27:08.560
Light is forced to even flash out just trying to avoid it.

707
00:27:08.569 --> 00:27:10.060
But owner knocks him down, Guma

708
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.130
dances out using that ultimate

709
00:27:12.235 --> 00:27:14.036
with carry as hell to peel them off.

710
00:27:14.235 --> 00:27:16.056
And we're seeing one of the big issues with the

711
00:27:16.296 --> 00:27:18.406
Sana is that if you're playing a front to back,

712
00:27:18.776 --> 00:27:22.355
Sana feels almost impossible to deal with, particularly with Ken.

713
00:27:22.745 --> 00:27:26.166
It's really hard to take people down to get through the front line, the K

714
00:27:26.326 --> 00:27:30.826
backs. Amazing. But if you get caught, particularly by something like Ali,

715
00:27:31.135 --> 00:27:32.355
you don't get to play the game

716
00:27:32.656 --> 00:27:35.245
and also they weren't playing front to back League of Legends. It was

717
00:27:35.635 --> 00:27:35.645
a

718
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.302
entirely with the fact that the shi

719
00:27:38.511 --> 00:27:42.982
goes in is in the middle and it felt fantastic, right? It was a bit of a split there from

720
00:27:43.112 --> 00:27:44.881
Webo with their decision making moving forward.

721
00:27:44.891 --> 00:27:46.901
It could mean that they could adjust that,

722
00:27:46.911 --> 00:27:50.182
moving into the next team fight and really show what this composition can do.

723
00:27:50.442 --> 00:27:52.001
And the tough thing for Webo is, is,

724
00:27:52.011 --> 00:27:54.052
it felt like so many things did go well for them

725
00:27:54.062 --> 00:27:56.781
in the early stages though skirmishes were working for them.

726
00:27:56.791 --> 00:27:59.942
But when T one hit T one hit way harder

727
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.630
and they have gotten so much out of these last couple of plays,

728
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.069
they're gonna try to take a tier one top.

729
00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:07.329
-- A figure is looking for a gauge spot.
-- Yeah. Looking for even more

730
00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:07.619
pro

731
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.800
-- who's going to land
-- somehow.

732
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:09.880
That charm didn't connect,

733
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:13.439
-- but it is still going to gather
-- a devour from over the wall from Crisp

734
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:15.319
Twan will settle for this in A T

735
00:28:15.739 --> 00:28:17.520
and this is where the earlier Drake from

736
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.060
Webo is gonna feel like a miracle in the sky, right?

737
00:28:21.069 --> 00:28:23.180
If they didn't have, that would be just as soul

738
00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:28.099
in addition to all the turrets that are there. 41 now.

739
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.219
Sure. Uh, they're not gonna have to solve. You still have five minutes of time.

740
00:28:32.229 --> 00:28:33.160
It's not looking great,

741
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:34.369
but at the very least they'll have one

742
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.780
more opportunity to try and get something going.

743
00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.589
My main issue is particularly with

744
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.020
Zeus now,

745
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:44.739
completely back in the game and sitting on a pretty ludicrous gold advantage.

746
00:28:44.959 --> 00:28:45.280
Uh

747
00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:46.060
three K

748
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.209
-- in the side line, it's gotta be
-- untouched.

749
00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:52.369
I mean, even in the team fight, he just finished an IE, he's got three full items. Now

750
00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:52.579
the

751
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.660
shai just finishes Derek's second.

752
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.239
And when you have the IE and you can talk

753
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.790
about not wanting a team fight with a whole breaker.

754
00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.790
But when you've got an IE and a cr and

755
00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.650
you can one hit the back line,

756
00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.494
this becomes incredibly hard to actually fight against this guy.

757
00:29:05.505 --> 00:29:10.305
So if T one can execute on those 55 as they have been doing all tournament long,

758
00:29:10.314 --> 00:29:15.175
we saw it showcased against JDG against the world's best in that five B five stage

759
00:29:15.435 --> 00:29:16.275
that it's gonna be tough for way.

760
00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:17.165
Look at

761
00:29:17.265 --> 00:29:17.505
Kia

762
00:29:18.204 --> 00:29:19.714
dancing forward, but like you say,

763
00:29:19.984 --> 00:29:20.354
KA L

764
00:29:20.875 --> 00:29:21.974
in the side line,

765
00:29:22.864 --> 00:29:22.974
we

766
00:29:23.175 --> 00:29:24.944
just trying to deal with these many ways not wanting

767
00:29:24.954 --> 00:29:27.895
to give up more than they can afford to lose.

768
00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:31.569
T one just gonna gather themselves a little bit of extra standing goal in a tart,

769
00:29:31.579 --> 00:29:32.849
not exactly the end of the world,

770
00:29:32.859 --> 00:29:36.319
but it's all just more money here for the coffers of T one.

771
00:29:36.619 --> 00:29:39.630
The shock blast starting to land a little bit lands on a fake of there.

772
00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.290
But they're gonna need more of those. If they want to stop the pressure,

773
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.709
the shock blasts do hurt. But T one is just playing so intelligently around this.

774
00:29:46.719 --> 00:29:47.920
They dropped that pink or a mid

775
00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.829
Z is playing very far back because no one is answering top.

776
00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:52.060
You know, as T one,

777
00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:55.599
the only recourse in this game we will have is to overload one side of the map.

778
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.229
Get a three

779
00:29:56.353 --> 00:30:00.522
V one, get a two V one, get a pick kill, then attack the rest of the T one squad. So

780
00:30:00.672 --> 00:30:02.723
until they show top, there's no reason for Z

781
00:30:02.883 --> 00:30:05.392
to walk up, he just plays it so far back, plays it calm,

782
00:30:05.402 --> 00:30:07.583
cool and collected and allows his team to

783
00:30:07.593 --> 00:30:09.672
get those incremental advantages up in top lane.

784
00:30:10.103 --> 00:30:12.133
-- And
-- this is now turned into an 8000 gold lead,

785
00:30:12.142 --> 00:30:15.623
the rebel Baron power play just kind of gigantic given the fact

786
00:30:15.633 --> 00:30:18.453
that it was relatively close for a lot of this game.

787
00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:19.103
So

788
00:30:19.453 --> 00:30:21.603
do really like to break open games,

789
00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:23.973
especially in the past when they were at their most.

790
00:30:23.983 --> 00:30:24.103
Do

791
00:30:24.885 --> 00:30:27.436
definitely a good sign if you are a T one fan

792
00:30:27.745 --> 00:30:30.436
and Weebo well and truly on the ropes here at this stage of the game.

793
00:30:30.735 --> 00:30:34.265
And for Webo. Now you're gonna either have to have someone on T one over.

794
00:30:34.475 --> 00:30:35.355
It sounds like you were saying

795
00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:39.406
Azel, I do think it has to be someone else because Killing Zay

796
00:30:39.536 --> 00:30:44.515
is when he is flash, he breaker on ie is going to be such an incredibly difficult task.

797
00:30:44.526 --> 00:30:47.926
But then look at what the rest of ti one is doing. No one is actually

798
00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:52.255
segmented themselves off from the rest. They're always working in tandem.

799
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:57.079
Exactly. You know, you win the 44 and you win the one B one. So as long as you have eyes on

800
00:30:57.349 --> 00:30:57.500
Weibo,

801
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.189
you are chilling, you just

802
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.589
make sure you're not getting poked out too heavily.

803
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:02.160
It's

804
00:31:02.329 --> 00:31:02.459
gonna be

805
00:31:02.689 --> 00:31:02.770
like

806
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.550
Baker waiting over the wall,

807
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.400
wants to land that charm to start this fight potentially, but no HBO

808
00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:08.910
just back away,

809
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.969
not wanting to take a fight unless it is far more within their favor.

810
00:31:12.979 --> 00:31:14.569
And with more information

811
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.569
and that is a very difficult thing to gather here in this game.

812
00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:20.209
You talk about saplings, things like that. All these opportunities.

813
00:31:20.219 --> 00:31:21.410
If you can't walk out of your base, they

814
00:31:21.511 --> 00:31:23.751
-- do a whole lot of good
-- does get very difficult.

815
00:31:23.761 --> 00:31:26.712
The very least you can use that to clear out brushes to move forward,

816
00:31:26.722 --> 00:31:28.602
try to reclaim some vision as they're going to do.

817
00:31:28.612 --> 00:31:32.401
Now knowing that ti one is on the reset, they will try to deny some of this vision,

818
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:34.911
but the death cap is going to be here soon for Baker,

819
00:31:34.942 --> 00:31:38.052
you can see wits end gonna be pretty soon as well for Guma,

820
00:31:38.062 --> 00:31:41.842
these third items are gonna be coming through when the G A comes in for owner as well.

821
00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:45.832
Ti one are just trying to get as prepared as possible for the soul or for

822
00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:49.171
-- this baron where they are really going to look to dominate and really
-- nicely done.

823
00:31:49.182 --> 00:31:49.842
Shown by our observe

824
00:31:50.063 --> 00:31:51.374
here is how little we

825
00:31:51.683 --> 00:31:52.193
know.

826
00:31:52.203 --> 00:31:52.423
Well,

827
00:31:52.433 --> 00:31:54.333
obviously they have a suspicion that one is going to

828
00:31:54.343 --> 00:31:56.034
be somewhere in the jungle and they can scout with

829
00:31:56.254 --> 00:31:59.823
slings, but actually retaking control becomes incredibly difficult.

830
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:00.494
And right now

831
00:32:00.604 --> 00:32:03.264
it's still fun, but in 40 seconds, the Baron is coming up and we

832
00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:05.134
will be faced with one of two choices.

833
00:32:05.144 --> 00:32:09.163
I just try to hard force your way in and like flash engage with

834
00:32:09.343 --> 00:32:11.193
Weiwei onto someone of T one.

835
00:32:11.203 --> 00:32:12.593
But if they don't give you the opportunity,

836
00:32:12.604 --> 00:32:14.813
you're gonna have to try and fight up a straight fight.

837
00:32:14.823 --> 00:32:16.154
-- And
-- one of the biggest problems with that

838
00:32:16.163 --> 00:32:17.813
is when you're approaching Baron from blue side,

839
00:32:17.823 --> 00:32:17.984
you

840
00:32:18.345 --> 00:32:19.836
for a perfect carry, ultimate right?

841
00:32:19.845 --> 00:32:22.826
You know, you all try to flash in, try to go for that engage.

842
00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:23.806
If you're trying to follow up on

843
00:32:23.916 --> 00:32:24.576
Weiwei's play,

844
00:32:24.765 --> 00:32:27.936
there's going to be a hostile takeover coming through your entire team. So

845
00:32:28.086 --> 00:32:30.686
the difficulty is extremely high for we

846
00:32:30.906 --> 00:32:31.755
from this position

847
00:32:31.946 --> 00:32:33.395
-- also
-- really difficult to lock down.

848
00:32:33.515 --> 00:32:37.416
Zeus is if he, if he's only trading with that unbound soul available.

849
00:32:37.426 --> 00:32:40.536
You see, Sha who comes down, that gives t one the idea

850
00:32:40.895 --> 00:32:44.145
that they are too invested towards that bottom side. That pressure from

851
00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:46.485
Zeus pretty clearly illustrated in that moment

852
00:32:47.489 --> 00:32:49.390
and look at the Adam spikes wits and done for

853
00:32:49.729 --> 00:32:50.180
Guma. No D

854
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.180
kept for Faker

855
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:52.689
G A for owner

856
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.510
and on Webo site,

857
00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.810
two item and power spikes have been hit but don't know if that's gonna be enough. Shau

858
00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:02.040
though does have his surreal dust done. Maybe that can give them the Pope.

859
00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.219
They need to contest this baron, but it looks like it just isn't sticking.

860
00:33:05.229 --> 00:33:07.040
I mean, it feels like it's just basically all of the shahu

861
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.170
from this position.

862
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.530
He needs to be able to hit shock glass on key members that can't deal them up,

863
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.849
which is basically just Baker.

864
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:13.140
Yeah.

865
00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:16.510
-- Going aggressive.
-- There's the kick flash once again, we, we is gonna flash

866
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:16.750
to,

867
00:33:17.103 --> 00:33:18.392
to get himself back. There's the

868
00:33:18.692 --> 00:33:20.812
nature's grasp as well as owner's gonna have to get out of there.

869
00:33:20.822 --> 00:33:23.032
So they've got, here's enough of a shield, the dawning shadow,

870
00:33:23.042 --> 00:33:24.672
not quite there with the damage

871
00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.272
and T one they tried something.

872
00:33:26.282 --> 00:33:28.072
-- They're not gonna get any kills but they get the flash
-- from the

873
00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:32.022
-- jungler and T
-- one don't even have to give up owner's G A.

874
00:33:32.032 --> 00:33:32.392
Right.

875
00:33:32.402 --> 00:33:35.432
He could play that aggressive knowing that he still has a G A available as, oh,

876
00:33:35.442 --> 00:33:36.812
he might have a flank here.

877
00:33:37.042 --> 00:33:40.083
Oh carrier. Ok. Looking for that angle.

878
00:33:40.863 --> 00:33:43.473
I know going to face check and then he just saw him

879
00:33:44.243 --> 00:33:45.182
out of the brush.

880
00:33:45.603 --> 00:33:46.243
Not quite

881
00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:47.595
enough. The

882
00:33:47.786 --> 00:33:51.326
Chlo comes in eventually, but that is going to put enough beer into we

883
00:33:51.806 --> 00:33:52.265
and, uh,

884
00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:54.066
yeah, like three

885
00:33:54.885 --> 00:33:54.985
cloud

886
00:33:55.095 --> 00:33:55.225
Drake.

887
00:33:55.395 --> 00:33:55.515
Yeah,

888
00:33:55.855 --> 00:33:57.196
I mean, he is just gonna kill that thing so fast.

889
00:33:57.206 --> 00:33:58.536
They're gonna start Baron at the same time.

890
00:33:58.725 --> 00:33:59.645
They're just gonna start it up.

891
00:33:59.656 --> 00:34:02.755
I think at this point, t one feels that they can do everything at once.

892
00:34:02.926 --> 00:34:03.135
And

893
00:34:03.265 --> 00:34:04.776
Weebo, you've got to make a stand. Now.

894
00:34:04.786 --> 00:34:07.546
There's just no way from this position, you can give up a free Baron.

895
00:34:07.855 --> 00:34:08.344
Well, way,

896
00:34:08.466 --> 00:34:11.456
way is in the vicinity, but the rest of the team is still making their way over.

897
00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:14.936
The shy does have teleport but they have no information. They have no vision.

898
00:34:14.946 --> 00:34:16.034
This Baron is gone.

899
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.159
This can

900
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:17.978
-- walk
-- up.

901
00:34:18.168 --> 00:34:18.728
There's not really anything.

902
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:21.739
Yeah, looking for the angle. It's not exactly behind Shau,

903
00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:23.239
but he's pretty fast

904
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.639
as Sha's

905
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.780
gonna avoid the charm for now.

906
00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:28.409
Cla connects on to FICA

907
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.540
there as well.

908
00:34:29.649 --> 00:34:32.280
He's still gonna look for that reset angle. And now with the Baron

909
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:32.850
in tow.

910
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.938
T one feel like they don't need a reset,

911
00:34:35.013 --> 00:34:39.233
try and break open the face of Webo here in game one of the Finals

912
00:34:39.474 --> 00:34:41.704
-- Nature's
-- grass flying forward. Ona

913
00:34:41.842 --> 00:34:42.853
still has that G eight

914
00:34:43.233 --> 00:34:44.773
Chris going down. So incredibly, Lu

915
00:34:45.184 --> 00:34:46.393
just executes the

916
00:34:46.654 --> 00:34:46.674
cha

917
00:34:47.253 --> 00:34:50.224
off to the side and there is another one, this guy's yone

918
00:34:50.753 --> 00:34:52.773
is just absurd

919
00:34:52.884 --> 00:34:53.184
and he

920
00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:54.520
is going to go down, Wei Wei

921
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:56.360
is burning there as well as now Shah

922
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.149
who tries to be the hero, but it does not work out.

923
00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:02.830
-- And I think t one are just gonna end game one here and
-- the

924
00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.090
early game t one not able to get a bunch of crucial kills,

925
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.870
but they don't let it face them.

926
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.149
They are able to find the one skirmish they're looking for,

927
00:35:12.159 --> 00:35:16.770
-- take the Baron and from that point on Weibo doesn't get to fight
-- back.

928
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.209
And now one and zero here

929
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.270
in the world final.

930
00:35:21.399 --> 00:35:24.139
T one on the red side as well,

931
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.629
going to be able to walk away victorious.

932
00:35:26.949 --> 00:35:29.889
-- It was an early
-- game composition and it was executed very well,

933
00:35:29.899 --> 00:35:32.800
but I felt like there were angles for Webo to go back

934
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.689
-- and try and rack on and figure it out for game
-- two.

935
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.030
It is tough. Right.
