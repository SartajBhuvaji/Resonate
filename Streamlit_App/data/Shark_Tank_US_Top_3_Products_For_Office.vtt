First in the tank is a way to be comfortable and still look professional.

1
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.600
Hi, Sharks. I'm Justin Beer from Bethesda Maryland.

2
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.520
And today I'm seeking $300,000 for 4% of my innovative apparel company

3
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.579
collars and co

4
00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:28.719
4%

5
00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.299
sharks. Welcome to business casual.

6
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.509
101. Let's begin.

7
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.569
So, you know, this look, were you wearing a dress shirt under a sweater?

8
00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.939
It's pretty much the go to look for every single guy that works

9
00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:45.590
in an office around the world. I lived in New York for 12 years.

10
00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:48.049
This is what's called the midtown uniform.

11
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.599
Problem is I hated wearing a long sleeved dress shirt under a sweater.

12
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.799
It was always hot and uncomfortable and scratchy.

13
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.069
I don't even have to spend the time buttoning up my shirt in the morning.

14
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.669
And then sometimes you would also get what's called floppy collar

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.430
where the color just flops down halfway through the day.

16
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.190
But worst of all

17
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.139
was putting him on a dress shirt under a sweater. It is so annoying.

18
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.779
The sleeves always get bunched up my sleeves like right up there by my elbow sharks.

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.309
I knew there had to be a better way, which is why I invented

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.980
the dress collar. Polo.

21
00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.440
It's a stretchy comfortable golf shirt except the top has a firm collar on it.

22
00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:27.819
So it gives you that exact same look of a dress shirt,

23
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.339
but it's really just a comfortable polo sharks.

24
00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.949
Guys are wearing this with a tie under a blazer with a sweater and even

25
00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:39.074
just a slightly more elevated casual look with a Polo Sharks.

26
00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:42.355
We are helping guys look stylish and stay comfortable

27
00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:44.474
and we've created a new category of shirt.

28
00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:47.955
Help me create the next great worldwide brand. Thank you

29
00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:51.555
in front of you. We actually have four different color styles.

30
00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:55.300
It's a nice stretchy material.

31
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.449
Yeah, it's stretchy

32
00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.379
-- ball. Totally
-- breathable. Quite an interesting idea.

33
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:02.529
Did you say 4%?

34
00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.739
4%?

35
00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:04.830
4%? Ok.

36
00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:07.010
So sales so far

37
00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.089
we started last year,

38
00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.210
we've sold so far 92,000 shirts for $5.4 million

39
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.889
direct

40
00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.940
or

41
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.119
direct to consumer all online.

42
00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.770
What was your profit margin on that? 20%?

43
00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:22.220
Net?

44
00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.449
-- Wow, that's impressive.
-- Yeah. So this is a really,

45
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.820
really well made product. Thank you. Um But there's two things I hate,

46
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.419
I hate with all my heart this look,

47
00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.149
I've always hated that midtown look and it's just not my style.

48
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.339
I really hate that look. Another thing is I hate offers at 4% for 300,000. I'm out.

49
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.179
That answer is that all right? We've had other shirt companies on Shark Tank.

50
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.649
However, of all the ones in 14 years, you've had the fastest growth to 5 million.

51
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.289
I always consider that a hurdle. Getting to five. That's a real business.

52
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.009
So you must have some execution skills in this story

53
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.360
-- that others don't have. You're
-- right, Kevin, the, the secret is in our marketing.

54
00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.289
It's in our funnel.

55
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.539
-- We've mastered the funnel. I've been doing this for 20 years.
-- Doing what?

56
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.389
-- For 20
-- years?

57
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.839
Business, internet marketing.

58
00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.110
I had a business to be one of the first check in applications for events.

59
00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.990
Let me jump in.

60
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.949
I mean, while these are super nice, I think what you're doing is fantastic.

61
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.990
I don't think it's the right investment for me.

62
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.029
-- So I wish you good luck and I will purchase these gifts, but I'm
-- out. Thank you.

63
00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.470
Thank you,

64
00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.539
Justin. I'm quite shocked because I'm in, I'm in this business.

65
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.919
I own a company called Localized and we basically

66
00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.360
take big brands global all over the world,

67
00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.029
this

68
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.949
type of product specifically across Asia.

69
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.580
Yeah, we're seeing growth, but we're not seeing it

70
00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:49.179
at the stage that you've just taken this business to.

71
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.490
-- What does it cost to make cost
-- to make landed $15? We sell it anywhere from 65 to 75.

72
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.020
Ok.

73
00:03:56.029 --> 00:04:00.500
I've never bid at a shirt deal because it Oh sure it's such a total commodity.

74
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.259
But you have numbers to justify.

75
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.800
First time in 14 years, I'm gonna make an offer to a shirt deal.

76
00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.449
I look at it and say 300,004% doesn't even get me out

77
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.220
of bed to put a shirt on in the first place.

78
00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.679
I'll do it for 10%. No,

79
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.539
Kevin.

80
00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:16.220
If

81
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.380
it was,

82
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.279
if this was an old line private equity deal, old slow growth cash flow.

83
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.220
This is a f one of the fastest growing D DC brands in the country.

84
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.799
We're going at 28% a month

85
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.739
when you,

86
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.040
when you want that wall.

87
00:04:29.049 --> 00:04:31.260
-- All
-- the reason I'm making the offer, do you have other

88
00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:32.170
Justin, Justin?

89
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.929
I have no other just

90
00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:34.059
to make, I'm just the only,

91
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:37.059
you've completely dismissed

92
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.989
an offer that I thought was

93
00:04:39.799 --> 00:04:40.529
pretty good.

94
00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.149
What sort of equity are you talking about?

95
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.200
Then you came in with 300,000 for 4% you've dismissed

96
00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:48.910
as if Mr Wonderful wasn't even in the room.

97
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.730
That's

98
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.079
a

99
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.880
$3

100
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.119
million.

101
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.140
This

102
00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.980
thing, I pushed it for 7.5 million. It's not worth 7.5 million.

103
00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:56.070
It's worth 20.

104
00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:56.880
What is

105
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.679
this?

106
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.000
What is your free? But

107
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.019
-- what is
-- it? 20%? We made a

108
00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:02.339
million.

109
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.230
What do you need

110
00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:07.410
inventory marketing? And we need to build a team.

111
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.010
-- If we're gonna go to $50 million we need to have some key players in
-- place.

112
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.600
How are you gonna get the money for inventory?

113
00:05:12.609 --> 00:05:14.250
So are you looking to raise or are you looking to?

114
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.290
-- I need a
-- line of credit.

115
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.809
But the other thing that I'm looking for is

116
00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:22.850
a mentor and somebody to help me grow this thing really to the next level.

117
00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:26.170
-- This is, you know what
-- I'll mentor you. I'll mentor you take the 10% offer

118
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.739
the next the next great brand.

119
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.420
I don't know whether you know this market as well as I do. This is beyond Bruton.

120
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.899
And the reason why this,

121
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.059
this is so brutal is because fashion shifts and moves at a literally rapid rate.

122
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:44.299
And you are up here at the moment and you

123
00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.709
think you've got the dream ticket coming into Shark Tank.

124
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.859
The reality is in 6 to 12 months.

125
00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:51.850
This could go out of fashion.

126
00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:53.690
-- Here's the reality, Peter
-- Peter.

127
00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:55.679
I don't think it's going out of fashion. Peter Peter.

128
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.470
Here's the reality, here's the reality. We're going into a recession.

129
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.739
People aren't buying shirts and they can't pay their mortgage.

130
00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:04.950
Then he starts bringing in more. He has a lot of skills. He starts bringing in more.

131
00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:06.910
You know, some things don't get sold.

132
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.970
He doesn't have a second door like Burlington or any place to get rid of this.

133
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.250
And now his inventory starts to chew into his profits and then he realizes, oh,

134
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.989
wait a minute,

135
00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.260
I don't know as much as I thought

136
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.260
and

137
00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:19.470
styles

138
00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:20.970
-- that when I
-- got in the business.

139
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.100
When I got in the business, Levi's is doing 18 billion. They're doing four. Now just

140
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.600
-- everything goes out of
-- Justin,

141
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.600
Justin, I'm about to make you an offer

142
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.570
you need to cut out cost.

143
00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:34.739
I have that infrastructure and I could take this

144
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.540
product and sell it all over the world.

145
00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:41.890
So I'm going to make you an offer. But my offer is also at 10% for $300,000.

146
00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.989
You

147
00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:43.320
must

148
00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:44.100
just

149
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.489
do

150
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.709
that

151
00:06:48.859 --> 00:06:51.519
-- $3 million valuation.
-- You were gonna go from four to what? Five,

152
00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:52.209
Justin.

153
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.670
Well, why did you just go down to two? He's out Justin.

154
00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:56.940
So look, $300,000 is obviously not enough.

155
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.700
So you already have in mind where you're going to go get your additional capital.

156
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:05.250
-- We need, we need probably a $700,000 line of credit. That's
-- easy.

157
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.109
So if I went in with Peter, so Peter,

158
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.299
so if you had a global domestic

159
00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.299
and I don't mind putting up and I'm sure Peter won't either.

160
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:16.160
Um, a line of credit at 89, whatever the interest rate should be. 89.

161
00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.339
Yeah, because rates are going up for a lot of credit

162
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.170
-- negotiator. You are for a line of
-- credit

163
00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:25.250
mark. Well, we have inventory, we have assets, hard assets.

164
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.350
I know you guys give out a line of credits to like apps and stuff.

165
00:07:27.359 --> 00:07:28.380
There's nothing tangible. We

166
00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:29.130
assets.

167
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.589
If you got

168
00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.170
it

169
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.100
when he said me and Peter together, which they both have,

170
00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:35.450
you

171
00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:35.679
make

172
00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:36.510
-- an offer,
-- you

173
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.760
make

174
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.010
your

175
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:39.220
time

176
00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:39.619
here,

177
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.339
everything they say to you.

178
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.359
So

179
00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:43.209
you

180
00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:44.829
see

181
00:07:45.109 --> 00:07:45.140
that

182
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.119
you get a chance to,

183
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.880
-- we're
-- seeing that and we're seeing that there's gonna be

184
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.410
10 more people through the door in another minute.

185
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.309
-- So what, what's your
-- offer? So, Justin,

186
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.950
I'll include the $700,000 line of credit, but 300,000 cash,

187
00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:56.869
what is the equity you're willing to offer us?

188
00:07:59.359 --> 00:08:00.730
Two sharks are out.

189
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.589
Kevin and Peter have each offered $300,000 for

190
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.070
10% of Justin's Shirt company collar and Co

191
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.390
Mark is willing to go in with Peter and

192
00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:14.720
has offered an additional $700,000 line of credit,

193
00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:18.059
but he wants a bigger chunk of equity than the 4%.

194
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.339
Justin came in offering and has asked him to make his best and final offer.

195
00:08:22.809 --> 00:08:24.750
What is the equity you're willing to offer us?

196
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.570
5%?

197
00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:35.030
I think 10% is too much. I just think 10% when you say

198
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.460
that just let me clean something after you make your decision making easier,

199
00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:39.659
10% is too much.

200
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.320
I'm out.

201
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:41.510
Ok.

202
00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:41.830
Yeah,

203
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.609
Justin,

204
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.789
I know the value of this business and you've done really well to get a 10% offer.

205
00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:52.270
So you're saying it's worth 0.5.

206
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.159
1st of all, we're gonna do 10 million in sales this year

207
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:57.630
is just

208
00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.229
the problem is

209
00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:00.580
this is why in a

210
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:00.960
partner,

211
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.780
but you've got to have, you have two ears for a reason, right?

212
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.710
And I don't think you're listening

213
00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:09.570
and that's not good.

214
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.989
That's not a good sign from an entrepreneur.

215
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.099
You do have to listen.

216
00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:17.330
You can dismiss it and you can walk out of here. That's absolutely fine.

217
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.349
But we should be allowed to voice our opinion and you're not

218
00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:22.929
allowing me to voice mine because you keep talking over me,

219
00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:25.289
which lets me know that you're not listening.

220
00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.809
You have everything right now in the palm of your hand

221
00:09:29.255 --> 00:09:31.025
and for 6%

222
00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.385
that's all that we're talking about. 6%.

223
00:09:33.395 --> 00:09:33.534
Have,

224
00:09:33.544 --> 00:09:36.085
you have no idea what the scale of the opportunity

225
00:09:36.094 --> 00:09:38.695
is and what we're gonna add and the value to that

226
00:09:38.864 --> 00:09:40.005
-- you're discounting
-- it.

227
00:09:40.015 --> 00:09:42.854
No, I'm not discounting what you guys can bring and that's why I'm here,

228
00:09:42.864 --> 00:09:44.234
but we're gonna do 10 million instead.

229
00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:44.765
If you

230
00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:45.125
take it

231
00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:45.914
-- with the
-- two

232
00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:49.034
of them, you could actually be doing 80 million.

233
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.250
So you're talking to guys who've been in the business 30 years.

234
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.210
We see deals like this all day long.

235
00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:58.090
Neither one of us don't do this deal. Our lives are not gonna change.

236
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.650
We're still gonna be rich.

237
00:10:02.469 --> 00:10:04.799
Justin, you're asking us to go to work for you.

238
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.010
There is no amount you could pay to hire the two of us to mentor you and help you

239
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.380
him

240
00:10:09.489 --> 00:10:10.390
globally.

241
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.679
I couldn't even hire him

242
00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:14.700
-- if you're valuing your company at 20 million and
-- 10, you

243
00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.210
give you a discount of three,

244
00:10:17.539 --> 00:10:18.909
Justin, Justin. I have

245
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.820
-- a
-- feeling you're not going to get a deal.

246
00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:21.510
I'm

247
00:10:21.929 --> 00:10:22.380
Justin,

248
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.630
would you do it for seven? No,

249
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.849
-- I think we're all out. Right.
-- We're all out.

250
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.239
7%. We're out

251
00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:36.469
Justin, I hate to say it,

252
00:10:36.479 --> 00:10:38.809
but I've got a feeling that one day you're gonna regret this moment.

253
00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:45.710
He still has a chance to say yes. So here it is

254
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.859
$300,000 in equity for 10%.

255
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.760
I'll put up a line of credit of $700,000. We'll do a market rate of interest. Right.

256
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.900
But it's first dollar in

257
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.780
meaning I get paid the minute you get paid by your customer

258
00:11:00.989 --> 00:11:01.799
and you're in it

259
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.849
and I'm in it.

260
00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:04.780
Yes or no.

261
00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:10.200
Let's do it.

262
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:10.929
Here we go.

263
00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:12.590
Good

264
00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:12.989
job.

265
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.780
-- You lucky.
-- Wow.

266
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.169
-- It's gonna be the best deal. You ever
-- did?

267
00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:17.210
Congrats, man.

268
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.159
You've done an amazing deal. Thanks.

269
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:19.590
Uh huh.

270
00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:20.320
Well done

271
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:20.659
for no

272
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.979
walking away.

273
00:11:22.119 --> 00:11:24.419
I knew there was a reason I didn't like guys that wore this shirt,

274
00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:26.039
but congratulations.

275
00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:29.210
-- No. Congratulations. I'm glad you were able to start listening. Thank you
-- so much.

276
00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:29.849
This was great.

277
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.059
Mm.

278
00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:34.219
He reminded me of me.

279
00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:37.179
I'm not gonna lie because when you're young you don't know what you don't know.

280
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.059
I did a lot more talking than listening.

281
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.359
-- It's
-- gonna be interesting to see how he works with us though.

282
00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:42.229
We'll find out

283
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.419
it means a ton that

284
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.539
Mark Cuban and Peter Jones are mentors now.

285
00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:50.409
I mean, having them in my corner is just going to

286
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.979
kind of free me up to,

287
00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:55.099
to think bigger than I ever thought before.

288
00:11:55.109 --> 00:11:58.460
And, uh, hopefully one day I'll be sitting next to them in one of the shark chairs

289
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.330
into the tank is an innovation for the modern office space.

290
00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:15.169
Hi.

291
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:17.179
Hey,

292
00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.409
do you want to be quiet? We, we're trying to pit the sharks.

293
00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:28.140
All right.

294
00:12:30.099 --> 00:12:32.349
All right. Ah, that's better. That's better. Try to go.

295
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.200
Hi, Sharks. I'm Anthony Pucci and I'm Nick Pucci.

296
00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.190
We're from Los Angeles,

297
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:43.159
California and we're seeking $350,000 for 10% equity in our company sharks.

298
00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:45.289
It's probably been some time since you worked in a

299
00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:48.559
cubicle or even sat in an open office desk.

300
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.385
But did you know most offices today feature an open design plan

301
00:12:52.594 --> 00:12:55.784
while it's great for collaboration and cutting costs,

302
00:12:55.794 --> 00:12:58.765
most employees are less productive because of it and

303
00:12:59.005 --> 00:13:01.984
that's because employees are dissatisfied with their work environment.

304
00:13:02.284 --> 00:13:06.395
In fact, a lack of sound and visual privacy is by far and away.

305
00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:10.215
The biggest strain on employee morale introducing cubic call

306
00:13:10.655 --> 00:13:10.684
at

307
00:13:11.184 --> 00:13:12.565
um the modern phone booth

308
00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:16.010
cubicle is the efficient solution to the shortcomings

309
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.229
of the design of modern day offices.

310
00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:22.159
Our booth focuses on the four pillars of privacy needs, audio,

311
00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:25.210
visual, territorial and information.

312
00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:27.169
So distractions like these

313
00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:28.299
girl

314
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.969
become a thing of the

315
00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:31.340
past

316
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.039
and our cubicle booths are fully customizable.

317
00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:40.520
They can be finished in a variety of colors, materials and even custom graphics

318
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.030
and those by folding doors allow cubicle to fit

319
00:13:43.039 --> 00:13:45.919
into offices where every inch of space is critical.

320
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.919
So sharks invest in us so we can help employers invest in their employees.

321
00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:53.039
Which one of you wanna come down and get a privacy

322
00:13:53.049 --> 00:13:55.280
break from Mr Wonderful and test drive one of the,

323
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:56.400
I

324
00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:57.159
wanna try it.

325
00:13:59.190 --> 00:13:59.270
Let me

326
00:13:59.489 --> 00:13:59.619
thank

327
00:13:59.799 --> 00:13:59.820
you.

328
00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:00.679
No,

329
00:14:00.809 --> 00:14:00.890
we

330
00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:01.229
are not

331
00:14:01.359 --> 00:14:02.409
doing this again.

332
00:14:06.309 --> 00:14:07.229
Oh, sorry. Excuse me?

333
00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:09.159
Oh,

334
00:14:09.359 --> 00:14:10.260
wow.

335
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.760
There you go.

336
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:17.440
It's, it's really, well, were you saying anything inside Robert?

337
00:14:17.869 --> 00:14:19.469
You can't hear a thing in there.

338
00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:20.669
You can

339
00:14:20.799 --> 00:14:20.830
hear

340
00:14:22.289 --> 00:14:22.830
what's going on

341
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.460
guys.

342
00:14:26.619 --> 00:14:27.739
It's, it works.

343
00:14:27.969 --> 00:14:28.020
It's,

344
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:30.840
ah,

345
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.419
can you guys hear them

346
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:33.609
ba,

347
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.030
ba,

348
00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:37.969
each booth comes with an air circulation fan,

349
00:14:37.979 --> 00:14:42.320
comes with a regular outlet so you can plug in a laptop and two USB chargers.

350
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.950
-- Why don't you walk us
-- through the numbers?

351
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.840
So we sell the first one there, which is our cubicle two. We sell it for 6009 95.

352
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:49.700
Oh,

353
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.289
-- $10,000. And what does it cost you to make? It
-- cost us $4200 to make?

354
00:14:56.539 --> 00:14:59.859
And how about the big one? The big one is 11,009 95.

355
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.549
-- What was the cost of the 11 K 1?
-- That one's 7200?

356
00:15:04.219 --> 00:15:04.369
Now,

357
00:15:04.789 --> 00:15:04.940
wait a

358
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:05.349
minute.

359
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.010
The competition

360
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.770
are relative to that.

361
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:11.640
They're selling theirs for about $15,000. So, Nick, how did you start? The company?

362
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.760
Tell us? So, we started our own marketing agency.

363
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.400
It was an open plan office and it's a family business.

364
00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:19.190
So we're Italian So we talk very excitedly. We

365
00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:20.840
come

366
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.390
on just got to the point where

367
00:15:22.719 --> 00:15:25.070
any important calls or any meetings that we had,

368
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.219
we either had to leave the office to take it.

369
00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:30.020
We had to stay, stay home. I said,

370
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.700
we can't deal with this anymore.

371
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.359
And after we put in our office and clients came in, they said, hey,

372
00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:35.750
can you give me one of these?

373
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.849
I said, yeah, sure. Once you deliver it, do you just simply plug it in?

374
00:15:38.859 --> 00:15:39.799
And it works because

375
00:15:40.369 --> 00:15:40.429
they

376
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.479
do have to be assembled

377
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.080
as

378
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:42.549
far as

379
00:15:42.789 --> 00:15:44.340
we actually have a video if you guys wanna see it.

380
00:15:44.469 --> 00:15:44.489
Yeah,

381
00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.179
it's

382
00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:46.520
quickly being assembled. You

383
00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:46.679
guys,

384
00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:47.919
right?

385
00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.260
With a little practice. Yeah. Ships flat. It's super easy to assemble. Nick.

386
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.770
Have you sold a bunch of them already? Yes, we have, we sold about 70 booths. We sold

387
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.729
your sales last 12 months,

388
00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:01.609
uh last 12 months, $495,000.

389
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.099
And when did you start the business?

390
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.000
Last August? How are you selling it

391
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:06.530
uh

392
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.929
-- directly direct to the end user online? I like the
-- solution.

393
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.530
But there's a huge problem here.

394
00:16:12.549 --> 00:16:16.530
You're making $1800 on the six K version.

395
00:16:16.539 --> 00:16:19.119
Your margins are so thin that the only way

396
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.450
this business works is selling direct to customers.

397
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.140
Yeah, but this, this is working for them. Why would they end up working

398
00:16:24.299 --> 00:16:27.190
guys? It's not working. You've only sold $495,000 in

399
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.390
business for a year.

400
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.489
How do you feel about the margins? Can you widen your margins? We definitely can.

401
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.210
If we get the investment able to invest in the inventory,

402
00:16:36.219 --> 00:16:38.770
we'll be able to add another 20 to 30%.

403
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.400
What's the vision? What's year two gonna look like? I mean, we wanna get to

404
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.359
$2.5 million next year. That's about 300 booths.

405
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.090
And we think with an investment, we can definitely do that. Do

406
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.140
-- you have
-- competition

407
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.830
right now? In the whole market?

408
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.940
There's probably about four competitors that we compete with.

409
00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.140
Nobody does a bi fold door.

410
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.669
It sounds trivial, but you're putting these in because space is an issue. Ok.

411
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.289
That makes sense. Yeah, but you don't think that a steel case could come in

412
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.979
and undercut all of the parts of this and bring the price down by 50%.

413
00:17:06.989 --> 00:17:11.140
I think they could, but they won't hit these price points in these margins.

414
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:12.410
I find that hard to believe.

415
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.839
But congratulations on what you've accomplished.

416
00:17:16.848 --> 00:17:19.670
It's, it's great, obviously, but I've got a couple of issues.

417
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.569
One, it's capital intensive

418
00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:23.969
two when you're just getting started.

419
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.348
It's not unusual,

420
00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:28.630
particularly for some when you're cheaper to get orders direct online.

421
00:17:28.719 --> 00:17:32.390
But I think you're gonna have to go to some, some other type of two tier

422
00:17:32.555 --> 00:17:33.204
contribution.

423
00:17:33.224 --> 00:17:35.454
That doesn't mean it won't be a great business for you two,

424
00:17:35.464 --> 00:17:38.015
it just means it's harder to invest and harder to get a return.

425
00:17:38.074 --> 00:17:39.484
And so for those reasons outs,

426
00:17:39.655 --> 00:17:40.564
-- congratulations
-- on

427
00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:41.545
it.

428
00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.814
You know, you're a niche

429
00:17:44.005 --> 00:17:46.334
within a larger furniture market.

430
00:17:46.484 --> 00:17:50.535
I think this is a highly competitive industry

431
00:17:50.795 --> 00:17:52.994
and I just don't know how you're gonna break into it.

432
00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:56.339
I totally get it.

433
00:17:56.459 --> 00:18:01.709
My only problem is there are competition out there that are already doing it.

434
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.319
And so I think I'm gonna wait a really long time for a return on my investment.

435
00:18:06.329 --> 00:18:07.939
So, unfortunately, I'm

436
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:08.050
a

437
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.010
ok, thank you. We appreciate it, appreciate it.

438
00:18:11.209 --> 00:18:12.729
I mean, just to sort of paint the picture.

439
00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:16.930
So they do say that 80% of all offices are open plan offices. Now,

440
00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:21.530
by estimates, there's maybe about 9.1 million businesses, you know, in the US.

441
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.339
If we were even to sell one booth to point 1/10 of 1% of those businesses,

442
00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:28.329
everybody says that about a big market.

443
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.630
Yes,

444
00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:33.489
that's a kiss of death on the shark tank. When you say all you need is 1/10 of 1%.

445
00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:35.530
That that's never a good sign.

446
00:18:38.189 --> 00:18:41.369
I'm gonna make you an offer but it's commensurate with the risk. Ok?

447
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.469
I'll give you 350,000. I want 10% of the company. Here's how I get paid back.

448
00:18:46.479 --> 00:18:48.609
You realize they came in asking for 10%.

449
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.189
-- I'm
-- not finished yet.

450
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.010
Silence, please.

451
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:54.599
Every time you sell one of these units,

452
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.410
I get $100 after I recover 1,050,000,

453
00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.890
which is three times on the original investment, it drops to $50 a unit

454
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.560
forever.

455
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.969
Just what you want in a low margin business.

456
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.939
Look, it's commensurate with the risk here. Maybe Barbara can do better. Anthony.

457
00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:13.060
-- You gotta be
-- careful. Kevin is a vampire. He'll live forever.

458
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.060
So $50 is gonna last a long time.

459
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:21.099
I have a lot of experience with this. Surprisingly, here's my offer.

460
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.780
It's better than his. I think this is so complicated. I don't know what it meant.

461
00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:29.979
It's pretty simple, but I'm gonna give you the 350,000 for 25% of the business.

462
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:32.579
Wait,

463
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.420
wait. Ouch.

464
00:19:33.689 --> 00:19:36.250
That's much worse than my office. Are you kidding me? Every dollar

465
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.170
that comes in, you get 100 bucks and you get triple

466
00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:44.310
mine reduces over time. Mark Barbara's forever 25% of the company, you know,

467
00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:45.310
Barbara,

468
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:45.479
you

469
00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:48.040
$50. That's very

470
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.599
expensive.

471
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.430
What do you wanna do?

472
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020
I

473
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.150
do

474
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:52.719
now?

475
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.020
Sharks are out.

476
00:19:55.229 --> 00:19:57.560
Nick and Anthony have two offers on the table

477
00:19:57.569 --> 00:20:00.270
from Kevin and Barbara for their office booth company.

478
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:00.599
Cubicle.

479
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.680
-- What do you wanna do? What do
-- you wanna do right now?

480
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.390
I want to go in the booth. We can hear you.

481
00:20:08.689 --> 00:20:10.089
You wanna go, we'll go talk to Booth.

482
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.170
Ah,

483
00:20:17.739 --> 00:20:19.969
this is hilarious. They're using the calculator.

484
00:20:20.729 --> 00:20:20.739
Oh,

485
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:21.540
Lord,

486
00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:22.709
welcome back.

487
00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:25.060
Did you guys hear us by each other?

488
00:20:27.239 --> 00:20:27.329
Ok.

489
00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:28.839
What did you guys figure out?

490
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.449
So, Kevin, we really appreciate your offer.

491
00:20:31.739 --> 00:20:31.849
Uh,

492
00:20:31.859 --> 00:20:34.250
it's a little too difficult for me to figure

493
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.650
out and for the eventual sell of the company,

494
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.119
-- it's not
-- a problem when you sell the company because they just buy out my royalty.

495
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.800
That's what happens. Many of my companies

496
00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:45.219
that's happened. $1 billion go on a little

497
00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:46.719
-- too
-- complicated. So, Barbara,

498
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.949
we would like to counter with

499
00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.300
350 for 15%.

500
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.140
It's uh not enough. I'm afraid I'll have to turn that down.

501
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.040
Yeah, I expect to do a lot of heavy lifting on this business

502
00:20:59.369 --> 00:21:03.650
and I have tremendous contacts in the contract furniture space and

503
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.280
I think I can make the right introductions for you.

504
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.000
Can't budge on the equity at all.

505
00:21:08.459 --> 00:21:10.630
Uh No, because I wanna be excited about it.

506
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:12.670
What do you wanna do?

507
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.280
How about, could we do

508
00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:15.829
450 for 20?

509
00:21:17.219 --> 00:21:22.130
No, I really, I feel like I need that quarter slice to get really juiced up about it.

510
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.959
Maybe you should revisit my offer because it has merit actually

511
00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:29.260
should think about. It doesn't sound like she's gonna budge

512
00:21:29.469 --> 00:21:32.589
-- Anthony.
-- I don't think these guys are budging. What are you guys gonna do?

513
00:21:33.239 --> 00:21:33.890
What do you want now?

514
00:21:39.439 --> 00:21:39.829
Yeah.

515
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.770
Ok,

516
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:41.770
Barbara,

517
00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:43.989
we'd like to take the deal.

518
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:47.150
Good move.

519
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:50.709
It's a good deal for everybody. Thank you.

520
00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:51.359
I appreciate

521
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.489
it. My pleasure.

522
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:53.319
Thank

523
00:21:53.589 --> 00:21:53.609
you.

524
00:21:54.089 --> 00:21:54.099
I

525
00:21:54.239 --> 00:21:54.849
appreciate it.

526
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.689
I think we got a great shark and Barbara with her contacts.

527
00:21:57.699 --> 00:22:01.280
I think it's gonna do wonders for our business. I see the point with the risk but

528
00:22:01.469 --> 00:22:03.199
I think it's, I think we're gonna do great with it.

529
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.040
Next up is a solution for our sedentary lifestyles.

530
00:22:16.969 --> 00:22:17.790
Hi, Sharks.

531
00:22:18.199 --> 00:22:21.680
My name is Bing Howenstine and I'm the CEO of all 33.

532
00:22:21.969 --> 00:22:24.869
I'm here today to ask for $500,000

533
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.339
for a 2.5%. Hello. Piece of our company. Bing baby.

534
00:22:29.829 --> 00:22:32.300
I know it is a very serious ask,

535
00:22:32.569 --> 00:22:36.239
but that's because it is for a very serious problem.

536
00:22:36.489 --> 00:22:37.469
Chairs.

537
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.270
They may be killing you.

538
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.930
Now, you've all heard

539
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.650
sitting is the new smoking.

540
00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:48.209
Well, they are right. Sitting for any length of period of time is really bad for you

541
00:22:48.339 --> 00:22:49.089
and chairs.

542
00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:53.910
Well, they've had the same basic design for almost 3000 years,

543
00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:55.420
whatever you're sitting in.

544
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.680
Even the fancy expensive chairs you guys are sitting in right now,

545
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.849
you can find yourself locked, stuck, immobile and a lot of times in pain

546
00:23:03.609 --> 00:23:06.890
and for all of us working at home these days, this is just not ok.

547
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.949
Well, I have some really good news for you.

548
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.619
Oh,

549
00:23:15.329 --> 00:23:17.800
all 33 is here to save the day,

550
00:23:17.989 --> 00:23:19.680
but don't just take it from me.

551
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.119
Let's hear what one of our biggest fans has to say.

552
00:23:24.989 --> 00:23:28.489
Hey, Sharks, I'm Justin Bieber and this is the all 33.

553
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.250
It's the chair that moves like I do.

554
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.900
I mean, guys, look at this perfect posture, got my chest up my shoulder back.

555
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:34.329
I'm waiting for

556
00:23:34.489 --> 00:23:34.510
you?

557
00:23:36.099 --> 00:23:38.319
I mean, have you guys ever seen a chair that could do this?

558
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.239
I'm doing a full ab workout right now.

559
00:23:41.189 --> 00:23:41.750
All right.

560
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.849
Hit me up later. I'll be back

561
00:23:44.219 --> 00:23:45.189
if you gotta sit.

562
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.250
This is it

563
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.780
now, Justin knows what he's talking about

564
00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:55.310
because this is our patented sit in motion technology.

565
00:23:55.719 --> 00:23:57.560
It's like a chair within a chair

566
00:23:57.689 --> 00:23:58.729
and it rocks

567
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.969
just like our sales about.

568
00:24:01.109 --> 00:24:04.199
You don't have to have moves like Justin in order for this chair to work for you

569
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.770
because all you have to do is sit,

570
00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:07.819
get fit

571
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.900
and all 33 of your vertebrae. Well, they're gonna keep moving all day

572
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.939
now. This is a chair

573
00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:18.689
now, Mr Wonderful. You're looking particularly uncomfortable. I am.

574
00:24:18.699 --> 00:24:21.160
-- Would you like to come up and see
-- what we're talking about?

575
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.400
-- I have a bad back from a squash injury. Oh,
-- well, then let's see what happens.

576
00:24:25.699 --> 00:24:29.050
Make sure you get your behind all the way into the back of the chair.

577
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.770
Scooch back there. All right.

578
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:35.369
-- And you can probably feel the rocking motion move back and forth. Very
-- interesting.

579
00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:38.770
Why is this making me sit up straight? Why is that happening?

580
00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:39.650
So,

581
00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:43.459
the, the patterns that we have about this are really quite unique.

582
00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.140
Basically, Doctor Dennis Colonel

583
00:24:45.439 --> 00:24:46.689
who invented this.

584
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.680
He's been doing this for a long, long time.

585
00:24:48.689 --> 00:24:52.650
He's got 45 years of treating backs necks and everything else he figured out.

586
00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.930
Let's get your hips moving almost as if what you're experiencing is, is,

587
00:24:55.939 --> 00:24:57.810
is a sensation that's almost like you're standing.

588
00:24:57.819 --> 00:24:58.680
But when you're sitting,

589
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.760
it is moving all 33 of your vertebrae while you're sitting.

590
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.069
And there's nothing else in the world that is doing.

591
00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:08.670
I'm very skeptical about all these claims on chairs because I've tried so many

592
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.040
and I also have tried different devices that way back.

593
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:12.630
This thing actually is working.

594
00:25:13.739 --> 00:25:16.770
I don't care about Bieber. I'm gonna kick his ass when an eye album comes out.

595
00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.599
-- I don't like your valuation though. Well, we can
-- talk about that.

596
00:25:20.689 --> 00:25:22.000
-- I would expect that from
-- you.

597
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.750
Tell us how, how did you get into this and what happened?

598
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.410
So I have been a patient of Doctor

599
00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:27.959
Colonel's for about 20 years

600
00:25:28.229 --> 00:25:29.219
and then friend,

601
00:25:29.469 --> 00:25:31.219
I'm also a bit of a serial entrepreneur.

602
00:25:31.229 --> 00:25:34.319
I got into making products and getting products sold

603
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.920
along the way. I got into the back hair space

604
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.719
when I sat on Dennis's chair, an early prototype.

605
00:25:39.729 --> 00:25:41.869
I said this is a whole different ball game,

606
00:25:41.949 --> 00:25:44.760
but I knew that Dennis was never gonna get this thing going

607
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.920
as a friend. I said, let me help you.

608
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.540
I'm gonna do a Kickstarter for you.

609
00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:49.479
So we did that.

610
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:54.500
-- It performed very well. What's very well? We did $800,000.
-- That's very

611
00:25:54.569 --> 00:25:54.979
great.

612
00:25:54.989 --> 00:25:58.390
Did you license it from him? No partners with him. I own a small piece of it.

613
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.739
-- How much of the company do you
-- own? I own about 5%.

614
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:07.579
So a premium chair in today's market sells for roughly $2000. A real premium chair.

615
00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:10.560
-- What does this sell for?
-- We're selling this for 799.

616
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.430
-- What's your margin? What's it cost you to make?
-- So, our margins about 67%.

617
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.920
-- Uh our cost delivered to a customer with all that good stuff is about 260
-- bucks. 2.5%.

618
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.250
500,020 million valuation. Yep.

619
00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:24.900
How many chairs are you selling? How many dollars?

620
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:29.550
-- So, this year alone, we've sold about 3.2 million. We're on track to hit 5.5.
-- Ok.

621
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.569
-- And what are you gonna make on five and a
-- half?

622
00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:32.920
So we were, uh, uh,

623
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.109
slightly profitable in the second quarter and we expect be the same in this uh,

624
00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:38.000
-- third
-- quarter.

625
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.859
I mean, just help me because,

626
00:26:40.079 --> 00:26:43.780
you know, I'm, I'm a quick study in, in most sectors, um,

627
00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.479
office supply furniture or even if you wanna call this high end chair design,

628
00:26:47.489 --> 00:26:52.060
whatever, maybe it would trade for 11 times pre tax cash flow.

629
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.339
I mean, I'm not saying

630
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.619
it isn't a great chair but it's a chair.

631
00:26:55.869 --> 00:26:58.930
-- Why is it worth 20 million
-- dollars?

632
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.810
We are looking at comps for other companies that are out there

633
00:27:01.819 --> 00:27:05.359
in a very similar space that are 3 to 4 times revenue.

634
00:27:05.469 --> 00:27:06.859
We know we're gonna get there.

635
00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:09.150
We have also talked to the market,

636
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:13.640
not my opinion, 20 million bucks is a pretty good valuation. So then why are you here?

637
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.390
Why am I here?

638
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.140
If you talked to so many people that gave you that valuation, why are you here?

639
00:27:17.579 --> 00:27:19.640
Because shark money is better than other money?

640
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.510
So you're charging us more than no sales because with sharks,

641
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.310
I'm prepared to give you a discount because you

642
00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.979
guys are sharks and you give a discount.

643
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.219
I'm the CEO of the company and I'm here to make a deal.

644
00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:31.599
-- You're
-- a marketing company, first and foremost, you've got,

645
00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:32.880
you've got your product, right?

646
00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:36.239
It's got its angle, it's got its differentiation and that's good. Right?

647
00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:38.839
I just don't wanna be in the chair business. Sure.

648
00:27:38.849 --> 00:27:42.319
You know, it's just of all the businesses big and small,

649
00:27:42.329 --> 00:27:45.380
not that there's anything wrong with the chair business, but it's just not for me.

650
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.849
Um So for those reasons, I'm out.

651
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.489
That's fair. Thank you.

652
00:27:49.069 --> 00:27:53.750
If you had come in here today and you wanted to sell me a chair, you're the perfect guy,

653
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.319
but you weren't here to sell a chair.

654
00:27:55.329 --> 00:27:58.880
You were here to sell a business, correct? You said you were a 5% owner,

655
00:27:59.229 --> 00:27:59.660
correct?

656
00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:03.339
I for some reason feel it lacks credibility. Ok?

657
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:05.569
I think that's a good lesson for other entrepreneurs.

658
00:28:05.579 --> 00:28:06.880
You can't send a salesman here.

659
00:28:07.109 --> 00:28:10.400
Well, with all due respect, this is my life right now.

660
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.390
And to, you know, it's a bit of a denigration to call me a simple salesman on this deal.

661
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.849
-- Barbara's very
-- good at pissing everybody

662
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:16.109
off.

663
00:28:16.229 --> 00:28:18.170
That's fair. You can do that.

664
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.579
But the fact is that's not, is that is not what is happening here.

665
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:23.949
I'm here to build a company.

666
00:28:23.959 --> 00:28:27.689
We are building a movement in a category that hasn't been done before.

667
00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:30.640
We're going up against the big guys that, you know, frankly,

668
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:34.140
it's a fractured system that I look forward to breaking.

669
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.670
I wish I could believe that you're building a category,

670
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.510
but I don't see that as a category.

671
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.349
I see it as a

672
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.579
chair with a new design element, but it doesn't get me all excited.

673
00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.530
So for that reason,

674
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:47.599
thank you.

675
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.500
The problem for me is whenever somebody comes in and

676
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.849
they have something different that can really be good,

677
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.290
but they're just starting

678
00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:56.989
and they wanna get a shark.

679
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.319
I always feel the smart thing to do is to be a lot smarter

680
00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:06.150
about your valuation because if you get somebody in and alongside with you,

681
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.680
you could take a one off item like this and blow it up, which is what I'm good at.

682
00:29:11.489 --> 00:29:16.310
So if you had had something that was just more realistic because you're,

683
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.469
I, I just feel it's so out of whack for me, it just turns me off.

684
00:29:21.479 --> 00:29:23.729
And for that reason, unfortunately,

685
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:24.530
I'm out

686
00:29:25.369 --> 00:29:25.880
that's fair.

687
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.890
There is a competitor company that just had a $200 million valuation on,

688
00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:30.680
you know,

689
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:30.829
just

690
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.680
-- a little higher
-- sales. I actually, I actually work with one of the bigger guys, uh,

691
00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:35.819
very desk

692
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:40.550
and the whole, uh, theory is the desk raise up and the chairs that,

693
00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.739
you know, they sell are a little pole, a chair. So you have to balance yourself.

694
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.079
Right. Um, this would be

695
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.699
a conflict, uh, with me.

696
00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:50.550
So I'm out,

697
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.660
I started choking on the valuation and I'm still choking on it.

698
00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.750
I tried the chair and it has merit but 500 K for 2.5%.

699
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.670
-- I don't get out of bed for 2.5
-- percent.

700
00:30:03.089 --> 00:30:03.119
Well,

701
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.739
I can't do it. I'm happy to have you in a higher place in the cap table.

702
00:30:07.599 --> 00:30:10.839
Just squeeze your head like a teenage pimple and I feel like doing that,

703
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.310
but I don't want to.

704
00:30:12.479 --> 00:30:13.709
So I'm out.

705
00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.180
Ok.

706
00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.239
Thank you very much. I will buy one though.

707
00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:21.209
Well, uh you're gonna have to pay full price this time, I guess I will.

708
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.819
All right. Thank you, Bing

709
00:30:26.869 --> 00:30:28.750
to have Barbara. Just call me a salesman.

710
00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.260
I think that was a bit offensive and, you know,

711
00:30:31.339 --> 00:30:33.270
I don't think any entrepreneur wants to hear that when

712
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.050
you put your blood sweat and tears into something.

713
00:30:35.229 --> 00:30:38.410
Um, I, I find that uh particularly, you know, not cool.
