Into the tank is an accessory for the tech generation.

1
00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:20.819
Hi. My name is Joe Croft.

2
00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.639
I'm from San Clemente California and I'm here asking

3
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.500
for $750,000 in exchange for 5% of my company,

4
00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:28.950
Gunner Optics

5
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.000
Sharks. We live in a world dominated by screens,

6
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.930
phones, computers, tablets, P CS.

7
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.659
You're probably staring at a screen 6 to 8 hours a day. At

8
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.599
the end of a long day. Your eyes might feel a little bit like this,

9
00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:47.229
like they're covered in sand

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.790
or perhaps they're dry and irritated because they take a pounding

11
00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:53.099
or

12
00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.659
maybe you've got a burning sensation from all that harsh blue light

13
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.099
or

14
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.500
maybe you just have a headache that won't go away.

15
00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:06.440
Computer eye strain has become the number one health related office complaint

16
00:01:06.449 --> 00:01:11.300
in the United States outstripping carpal tunnel by 40 to 1.

17
00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:14.099
Now, all those screens aren't going away anytime soon.

18
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.739
So,

19
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:15.900
what's the solution?

20
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.220
Gunner optics that um

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.849
I work for a digital age.

22
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.589
Our patented optical technology is the only clinically proven solution

23
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.750
for relieving all four major symptoms of computer eye strain.

24
00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:33.269
Gunner can help prevent dry eyes,

25
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.199
reduce muscular, eye fatigue

26
00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:36.540
fight against glare

27
00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:37.980
and very importantly,

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.500
scientifically proven to reduce that harmful blue light

29
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.959
emitted from those screens by 65%.

30
00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.800
Using your eye wear, you'll find an increase in optical clarity,

31
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.370
focus and visual performance.

32
00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:55.830
So hopefully those long days at work don't feel quite so long.

33
00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:57.449
So sharks,

34
00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:00.489
let's make headaches and digital eye fatigue. A thing of the past

35
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.849
in a world where screens are never more than a few feet away.

36
00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:07.680
The need to protect your eyes has never been so clear.

37
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.949
So I've got some samples here to pass out. Good.

38
00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.779
Lovely.

39
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.979
Here you go.

40
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.360
For name.

41
00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:21.179
There you go,

42
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.419
sir.

43
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.899
And for you. Thank you so much.

44
00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.500
Thank you Joe for you. Thank you very much.

45
00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:29.050
So,

46
00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.050
as you hold that out in the computer viewing distance, you'll see

47
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.350
that the contrast is enhanced. There's a

48
00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.809
-- feel your eyes relax, it
-- blocks the blue light. Correct.

49
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.529
Absolutely.

50
00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.470
In fact, we've scientifically measured it,

51
00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.369
we block 65% of the blue light that's emitted from all those screens.

52
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.809
So yellow light is more calming and better for the eyes.

53
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.869
-- So there's
-- a lot of science that goes into why yellow light is

54
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.720
much better and why blue light which is very close to the UV.

55
00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.550
Part of the spectrum is high energy and it is actually

56
00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.720
imaging to you and it can disrupt your sleep patterns.

57
00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.199
-- So let's get right into the
-- business.

58
00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.139
Tell us about your sales.

59
00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:05.899
There's gonna be a lot of sales with the $16 million valuation.

60
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.179
Last year, we sold $6.5 million worth of eyewear.

61
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.559
Wow.

62
00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.699
I like it. What about this year? This year we're trending towards 7.5.

63
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.850
We are approaching 60% gross margin. That's great.

64
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.940
-- What's the average price point, average, price point right now is around 60 to
-- 80?

65
00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.679
-- Then are you making money? And if so how much
-- the answer is? Yes.

66
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.779
And last year you bet do was 500.

67
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.179
You're doing a 60% margin, which is great, but you only made half a million E but

68
00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.649
where's the cost going? So

69
00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.949
we are going to build a brand.

70
00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.559
We have penetrated into the gaming category.

71
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.339
I was thinking for gamers, this would be absolutely.

72
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.309
Strength has been right.

73
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.309
Gaming is where you basically deliver this with the gaming crowd.

74
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.639
We sponsor a number of E sports athletes. E sports is the wild west right now.

75
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:49.990
Do you have a patent?

76
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.990
That is a great question because we not only have a patent, we've got

77
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.419
battle tested. IP

78
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.619
we have gone toe to toe with some of the largest people in the industry out there.

79
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.020
We've gone into the courtroom and come out victorious. Joe. Does that have to?

80
00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.059
What's your experience in the eyewear business?

81
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.770
-- I
-- spent a formative part of my career at Oakley, which as you guys probably know,

82
00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.330
dominates the performance category of sports.

83
00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.669
How much did you raise? We've over the course of a company raised $9 million.

84
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.269
-- There's the rock just got dropped.
-- How much do you owe me

85
00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.570
personally? At 20%?

86
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.200
Ok.

87
00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:25.540
-- What happened to the
-- wrist as you raise you dilute,

88
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.529
you've had to continue to raise money.

89
00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.399
-- That means something
-- didn't work.

90
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.799
We really have only raised money in two large tranches.

91
00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:35.059
So we haven't raised any money for the last several years.

92
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.410
The company is profitable. Right. Ok. Well, good for you. That's a good start.

93
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.950
-- Absolutely. If you
-- can give the numbers, it might help just rapidly.

94
00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:44.799
What your revenue has been last year? 6.5

95
00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:47.220
the year prior we were 8 million,

96
00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:48.720
8 million. Correct?

97
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.149
And

98
00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:54.290
your prior was about the same. What are you gonna use the money for

99
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.290
marketing?

100
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.609
That's a key thing. We need to get the exposure out.

101
00:04:58.619 --> 00:05:02.429
We are evangelists about how bad people's eyes are becoming.

102
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.869
So then you must have debt.

103
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.850
We do have debt,

104
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.839
how much debt? 1.2. 0,

105
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.029
wow.

106
00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:11.480
When I see an entrepreneur who has a 20% stake in the business,

107
00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:13.170
I stopped looking at them as an entrepreneur.

108
00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.829
Honestly,

109
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.130
I think of them as an employee with an incentive. It makes me feel very uncertain.

110
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.190
I'm mel

111
00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.579
ok.

112
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.769
I'm in the computer business. I work with

113
00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:29.980
300 computer geeky guys. I will buy them anything they want.

114
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.579
We look at screens 24 hours a day, seven days a week for some of the biggest companies.

115
00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.260
In the world. No one has ever come to me and said

116
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.369
my gosh, I need a pair of yellow glasses.

117
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.299
You've raised $9 million. There's just a lot of uncertainty for me.

118
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.140
Sorry,

119
00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.940
I'm out.

120
00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:52.179
You deserve a lot of credit. A ton of credit

121
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.910
because you are an eyewear industry. Survivor.

122
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.519
There's not a lot of those, but in looking for an investment,

123
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.540
I'm not looking for a Survivor. I'm looking for a Thriver. Right. It,

124
00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:06.670
it's not obvious to me that you know exactly how you're going to use the money.

125
00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:08.279
-- What
-- we do need to do is go from a

126
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.029
niche marketed product which is strictly in the gaming space.

127
00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.980
We need to get out into the mainstream. We need to go QVC. You need to

128
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.350
no, see you're making my point. Right.

129
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.269
Bouncing, bouncing, pivoting, pivoting, pivoting,

130
00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:23.309
looking for something to take you to the next level,

131
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.799
but you don't know what that is yet.

132
00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:26.739
And because you don't know what that answer is.

133
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.970
I have to say a mountain

134
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.019
look, I'm torn

135
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.000
because

136
00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:34.200
I love the brand.

137
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.519
I like you.

138
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.730
You got the energy, you got the passion

139
00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:40.279
and I think you have a brand name here

140
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.510
that can truly be built. But what I do well is

141
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.160
I add fuel to growth brands

142
00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:48.269
and

143
00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.950
much as I love your passion.

144
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.339
I feel that the time has been there to

145
00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:55.760
take this brand into channels that would have caught

146
00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:58.549
and much as my heart is saying, jump in with the guy.

147
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.040
My gut from a financial standpoint

148
00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:02.269
is reticent.

149
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.390
And for that reason,

150
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.220
I a

151
00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:07.690
good luck Joe.

152
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.459
There's

153
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:09.239
no,

154
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.829
there's

155
00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:12.290
more

156
00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:17.640
four sharks are out

157
00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:22.799
and Laurie is Joe's last chance at a deal for his computer Safe Eyewear company,

158
00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.049
Gunner Optics.

159
00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:27.410
When you put those glasses on two things I noticed happen.

160
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.429
One that irritating blue light is gone.

161
00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:31.440
Two,

162
00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:36.519
it's much clearer and it's almost like the letters get bigger and more defined.

163
00:07:37.459 --> 00:07:41.720
Very interesting to me because I have sold a product called Neo

164
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.799
Neo

165
00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:47.089
Sunglasses. I've sold probably $30 million worth of them.

166
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.739
My concern here is that you have a lot of debt. You don't have a lot of equity.

167
00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:54.440
I see a solution.

168
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.329
I see the solution is

169
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.920
I do feel TV is what you need.

170
00:07:59.059 --> 00:08:03.640
You need the demonstration because once you look through them, you're sold,

171
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.350
I'm gonna give you a flyer, but

172
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.119
it's gonna be this,

173
00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:11.230
I'm gonna give you 375

174
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.920
as an investment,

175
00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:17.079
375 as a loan at 8%

176
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:18.660
for

177
00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.459
8%

178
00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:27.440
-- and I'll try to blow it up for you.
-- That's a no brainer. That, that is amazing.

179
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.690
I love the fact that we have an offer on the table

180
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.589
-- and
-- the only offer on the

181
00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:31.950
table

182
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.690
-- it
-- is the only offer on the table.

183
00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:36.539
-- I feel
-- confident that I can sell these

184
00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.859
and I know you can

185
00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:42.450
out of respect to our current investment base because just

186
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.530
like you would want me to care for your money.

187
00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:47.039
I need to care for the money of our current investors

188
00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:51.799
taking that much of the company would be tough for those current investments.

189
00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:54.679
What if I gave you the 750 K all as a loan

190
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.809
at 8% and I take 5%.

191
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.580
Listen, I see me as a great lifeline for you

192
00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:03.940
because you need awareness.

193
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.820
You really need awareness,

194
00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:09.049
-- you know your margins, we know our margins.
-- Absolutely.

195
00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:11.049
So you know how much more you have to sell

196
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:16.119
-- to pay back? The 750
-- 1000 that 750 K coming in is beautiful. We love it.

197
00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:19.479
The equity slice just seems a little bit rich.

198
00:09:20.239 --> 00:09:22.780
I'd love to counter with 2.5%

199
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.460
on the equity slice. Wow,

200
00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:32.419
-- 2.5 you came in here offering five
-- exactly 5750 straight straight equity.

201
00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:34.539
You're dealing with one of the biggest brand builders

202
00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:36.739
in America here and we know that we wouldn't

203
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.450
nickel and dime it like you wanna go from 6 to 60 not from 6 to 7.

204
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.690
-- I wouldn't play with
-- fire.

205
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.659
The 2.5% is

206
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.739
just

207
00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:50.820
-- so small.
-- Is there somewhere in the middle there?

208
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.210
Are you really gonna

209
00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:55.729
-- do that for just 2.5%? Nickel
-- and diamond?

210
00:09:56.909 --> 00:10:01.179
Yeah, I, I'm asking the question because we really want to get a deal done and

211
00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:01.559
say

212
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.520
-- yes to the five
-- percent.

213
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.820
-- If you really want to
-- do a deal,

214
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.809
the only reason I mentioned the equity is with that growth and again,

215
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.669
being in a space where there's a ton of

216
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.349
danger of losing the one deal you have on the table. Hold on.

217
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.219
We're having a nice discussion, Joe, you're gonna lose

218
00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:18.450
the

219
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:19.359
2.5.

220
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:20.109
Take

221
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.809
-- my
-- deal. Are we up to? How about four?

222
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.719
I don't want to do.

223
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.280
All right, let's go ahead and do it.

224
00:10:31.729 --> 00:10:33.239
Yes. Let's go ahead and do it.

225
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:33.840
All

226
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.119
right.

227
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.309
Here we

228
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:37.630
go.

229
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.760
All right. This should be fun. This great product. It is a great

230
00:10:40.909 --> 00:10:41.369
product.

231
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.619
The

232
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:42.960
product.

233
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.830
Congratulations. Congratulations.

234
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.909
When it came down to the actual deal on the table, it got very, very real.

235
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:56.489
You're taking money, that's real dollars.

236
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.429
This is real investors that are gonna be affected by it.

237
00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:03.280
That's when I started to sweat. But at the end of the day we got the deal done.

238
00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:04.099
I

239
00:11:04.369 --> 00:11:06.520
think my blood pressure's coming down just a little bit.

240
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.500
Next up is an entrepreneur from Austin,

241
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.880
-- Texas with a new way to work out while having
-- fun.

242
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.690
Hello, Sharks. My name is Terry Jones and I'm the CEO of Nexor.

243
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.539
We're seeking a $2 million investment for a 10% stake in our company,

244
00:11:30.789 --> 00:11:31.330
Nexor.

245
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.450
The next generation exercise system is an interactive and

246
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.369
intelligent fitness and gaming platform that delivers a fast,

247
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.650
fun and effective workout for everyone.

248
00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.690
It doesn't matter if you're an average Joe or if you're an Olympic medalist,

249
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.559
like my friend Marlon Esparza

250
00:11:48.909 --> 00:11:49.400
Nexor

251
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.179
combines the benefits of a personal trainer with

252
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.219
the fun and excitement of today's online games.

253
00:11:55.229 --> 00:11:59.799
You simply select your personal profile, then you choose between circuit training

254
00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:04.099
high intensity interval rounds or a one on one challenge against

255
00:12:04.109 --> 00:12:06.729
one of our Nexus avatars and you're ready to go.

256
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.020
That's

257
00:12:22.869 --> 00:12:23.809
you would kick my ass.

258
00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.880
There you go. And when you're complete,

259
00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:29.359
Nexus provides a detailed analysis of your work.

260
00:12:29.369 --> 00:12:32.780
Every time you train, you're gonna live a happier sexier,

261
00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:35.900
healthier life using the same methods as professional

262
00:12:35.909 --> 00:12:38.599
boxers and M ma athletes around the globe.

263
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.390
So which of you sharks would like to

264
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.000
draw first blood against your ultimate opponent.

265
00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:45.619
We've got a uh special avatar that we brought.

266
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.500
Hey,

267
00:12:49.109 --> 00:12:53.219
that's a good looking dude. There you go, Marlo. Be really easy on him.

268
00:12:53.229 --> 00:12:56.719
-- He's a wonderful guy. One punch Cuban where
-- lights up you hit.

269
00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.549
Look at him,

270
00:12:58.719 --> 00:12:58.960
I'm just

271
00:12:59.119 --> 00:12:59.159
gonna

272
00:12:59.679 --> 00:12:59.690
uh

273
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.700
Mr Wonderful. You're in trouble. I gotta tell you.

274
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.010
Look at that.

275
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.900
Awesome.

276
00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:09.830
Ready to go, Mark.

277
00:13:10.429 --> 00:13:13.190
But you can see Mark was 36% accurate.

278
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.750
He was hitting real hard but not necessarily real accurate.

279
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.359
-- I didn't
-- feel a thing.

280
00:13:22.429 --> 00:13:23.690
-- Mark. Was it
-- fun?

281
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.440
I mean, it was a nice little workout.

282
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:29.039
How long do we do? You did 15 seconds? I mean, doing three minutes on that

283
00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:32.109
would be a great workout. Terry eventually. We got to get to this.

284
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.030
We put a huge valuation in this company $20 million. Do you have any sales?

285
00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:41.119
Uh we do, we are uh sales to date are a little over $4 million. Wow,

286
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.080
4.2 million. That's over about 18 months.

287
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.159
Do you make any money? We are not profitable yet.

288
00:13:48.169 --> 00:13:50.520
We should be profitable in September of this year.

289
00:13:50.659 --> 00:13:54.489
And is this designed for gyms and the home? Absolutely.

290
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.150
The black model is the personal model. The silver model is the commercial model.

291
00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:00.409
Where are the sales? Give me the breakdown currently?

292
00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:03.609
About 70% commercial and about 30% home.

293
00:14:03.929 --> 00:14:06.989
I think it's very cool. I do really like it.

294
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.419
You get demonstration,

295
00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:12.080
-- I think better than almost anyone in the world having your experience while
-- you're

296
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.349
up to Laurie. Let's go back to the numbers.

297
00:14:15.099 --> 00:14:16.719
-- What's your cost to make one
-- of those units?

298
00:14:16.729 --> 00:14:18.929
Uh just under $2000 for the commercial units?

299
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.599
Well, Terry,

300
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:25.619
-- this is
-- really a digital punching bag punching bag costs about $1200 a good one,

301
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.619
leather, et cetera.

302
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.169
-- What does that
-- cost? Uh The commercial unit is $7000.

303
00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:30.960
Who

304
00:14:31.929 --> 00:14:33.099
it is? That's very, that's

305
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.369
-- you can buy a car
-- or

306
00:14:34.489 --> 00:14:35.320
-- buy
-- this

307
00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:41.729
or you can buy a uh buy a treadmill or an elliptical in the same price range.

308
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.840
What about the home unit? How much is that, Terry?

309
00:14:44.539 --> 00:14:44.549
Uh

310
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.200
2995. How did you sell them?

311
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.030
We sell, we promote it on TV, with direct to consumer advertising.

312
00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:53.630
We sell electronically. We've been running infomercials.

313
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.669
Uh, we've run one in two minute spots. Not the long form.

314
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.719
How are those doing?

315
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.989
Uh, they did very well. We ran them last year.

316
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.630
We've spent about a million dollars in TV. Last year,

317
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:02.950
uh,

318
00:15:02.969 --> 00:15:06.679
generated about a million and a half dollars in sales that brings up something else.

319
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.359
How much in debt are you?

320
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:16.049
Uh We have on our balance sheet about uh $7.5 million a shareholder.

321
00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.710
I knew I was gonna get to

322
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.280
that

323
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.150
one. Terry, Terry, how much of that is your own money?

324
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:23.909
Uh

325
00:15:24.729 --> 00:15:24.739
A

326
00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:28.489
small portion of that is mine and my family's money and that means

327
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.640
that now we're gonna find out you own very little of this company,

328
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.140
correct?

329
00:15:34.369 --> 00:15:34.869
Um

330
00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.150
I uh own

331
00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:38.270
about 35% of the company.

332
00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:42.539
You know, I'm a nice guy, so I wouldn't do this to you.

333
00:15:42.549 --> 00:15:44.400
But if I were an opportunistic guy,

334
00:15:44.409 --> 00:15:47.599
I would just simply wait for that debt to come due and then I'd own your company.

335
00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:51.400
Basically, that's what those debtors are gonna do.

336
00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.659
-- If you don't figure out a way to pay them, they'll own all the equity when this is
-- over.

337
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.599
Um

338
00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:59.190
We don't believe that's gonna happen given where we are

339
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.109
in run rate by the time that debt is due,

340
00:16:01.119 --> 00:16:03.609
our cash flow will allow us to repay that debt.

341
00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:04.349
-- But, you
-- know,

342
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.390
in life and in business. Pooh, pooh happens.

343
00:16:09.849 --> 00:16:12.179
Don't you think a savvy financial investor

344
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.789
in which I'm gonna include myself right now

345
00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:16.679
would want to see that resolved before I put a dime into this company.

346
00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:19.859
Because if I buy your equity at this valuation

347
00:16:19.869 --> 00:16:22.859
of $20 million and the dead guys aren't happy.

348
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:25.109
-- I'm screwed,
-- Terry.

349
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.919
We will be uh repaying that and addressing the happens if you don't,

350
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.099
well, we'll have to deal with those creditors at that time.

351
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.010
How many investors do you have? We have about 60 investors. 60

352
00:16:42.849 --> 00:16:45.789
-- have your investors
-- seen any money back yet? Oh, hell no,

353
00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:46.429
no.

354
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.349
This is a story about a lot of debt,

355
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.179
-- great product.
-- Too much

356
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:52.669
debt.

357
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:53.669
I'm out.

358
00:16:54.979 --> 00:16:57.840
Thank you. I have gone to the future in a split second

359
00:16:57.969 --> 00:16:59.109
and here's what happened.

360
00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.250
The debt wasn't paid back

361
00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:03.179
and those shareholders wiped you out.

362
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.959
You are now an employee of the company with no equity at all.

363
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.358
The smartest guys on the balance sheet are always the debt guys.

364
00:17:09.368 --> 00:17:10.920
-- They know your
-- future already.

365
00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:15.660
Luckily those guys are also my common stock and convertible to venture partner,

366
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:16.650
-- but they're gonna
-- own all

367
00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:18.209
that doesn't matter.

368
00:17:18.219 --> 00:17:20.510
They're gonna force you into bankruptcy and anything

369
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.170
that you own is going to be gone.

370
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.689
Any assets that you had are going to be sold

371
00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:26.608
and they're gonna take their pennies on the dollar.

372
00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:27.449
They're not your friend.

373
00:17:28.869 --> 00:17:30.619
Good luck to you. But I have a feeling

374
00:17:30.819 --> 00:17:32.089
when we meet you again.

375
00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:33.819
You're gonna be an employee. That's it.

376
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.250
I'm out.

377
00:17:39.689 --> 00:17:42.410
You know, I'd love to, uh, be before you today with less debt.

378
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.890
Unfortunately, the markets told us how we could raise money to deliver it.

379
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.270
We're standing before you with two products with a $20 million valuation,

380
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.859
which is a fraction of companies like total gym like Nordic Trek, like Bowflex.

381
00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:57.050
These are billion dollar market cap,

382
00:17:57.459 --> 00:17:58.040
not anything

383
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.619
like them at all.

384
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.199
Those are very simple devices. How you even spent $7.5 million to develop?

385
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:07.439
This is beyond me and the valuation.

386
00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:07.810
Normally,

387
00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:10.959
I'm the one who doesn't care about valuation because you can always grow past it.

388
00:18:10.969 --> 00:18:14.099
If you've learned from the wise one, I wouldn't call you the wise one,

389
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.000
but

390
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.729
it's just crazy

391
00:18:17.489 --> 00:18:18.869
for that reason. I'm out.

392
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:20.199
Ok.

393
00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:24.849
You know, you're like in the third round with a young Mike Tyson.

394
00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:29.199
He's giving you two body blows, but he's about to cock back

395
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.319
and crack your head to the white meat.

396
00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:33.969
Dead is dangerous.

397
00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:35.209
I'm out

398
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.349
and then there was one

399
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:44.489
I like it. I think it looks like a lot of fun.

400
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.829
Great way to have a workout.

401
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.410
I think that it's a great product.

402
00:18:49.859 --> 00:18:51.420
You are in serious debt,

403
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.219
but I think you'll get out of it,

404
00:18:55.479 --> 00:18:58.219
but I don't like to get into that type of situation.

405
00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:01.109
And for that reason,

406
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:01.849
I'm out.

407
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.640
Thank you, Laurie.

408
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.709
-- Thank you, Sherlock, Eric. Thanks very much.
-- All the best.

409
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.640
I didn't know if he was gonna get out. Laurie.

410
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.540
His mouthpiece is in the third row by now.

411
00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:16.150
-- It's one of those slow
-- motion

412
00:19:19.459 --> 00:19:22.800
while I appreciate what the Sharks said. I have no doubt

413
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.579
that Nexor

414
00:19:23.869 --> 00:19:25.859
and our team will be successful.

415
00:19:25.869 --> 00:19:28.349
We will overcome these low balance sheet issues

416
00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:31.550
and continue to grow to a profitable worldwide company

417
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.329
into the tank is a high tech way to transport you to an alternate reality.

418
00:19:49.949 --> 00:19:51.579
Hello, Sharks. My name is Jan Gulu.

419
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.469
I'm from Houston, Texas. Our company is Virtue

420
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.530
and we are seeking $2 million in exchange for 10% of our company.

421
00:19:59.819 --> 00:20:00.420
This

422
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.469
is the Omni

423
00:20:02.229 --> 00:20:05.599
the first ever virtual reality platform that allows you

424
00:20:05.609 --> 00:20:07.390
to be truly a part of the video game.

425
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.640
The Omni is an omnidirectional treadmill but it removed all the moving parts.

426
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.859
It's basically a low friction surface on which the user walks

427
00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:17.369
with his special shoes that have a low friction sole.

428
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.630
Steve will also put on a support belt which provides safety.

429
00:20:20.739 --> 00:20:24.719
Can't fall on the omni also provides some support so you can use the omni

430
00:20:24.729 --> 00:20:27.719
hands free so you can hold a controller or a gun in your hand.

431
00:20:27.729 --> 00:20:31.900
The omni can be played with any existing game that uses keyboard input.

432
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:35.459
Once you're in the omni, you can put on the virtual reality glasses. Oh Cool.

433
00:20:35.469 --> 00:20:36.920
This is right up your alley.

434
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.319
The OMNI enables you to walk,

435
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.140
run,

436
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.310
jump

437
00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:45.510
and crouch

438
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.199
in 360 degrees and put your mind and your body into

439
00:20:49.209 --> 00:20:51.630
the video game to transport you into a different world.

440
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.219
Cool. Wow.

441
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:14.780
Virtual reality hasn't ever broken through because the technology wasn't ready.

442
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:15.959
That's all changing. Now,

443
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.959
the technology is here. The omni is here.

444
00:21:18.969 --> 00:21:20.660
So which of you sharks want to be

445
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:23.180
on the forefront of this virtual reality revolution?

446
00:21:23.189 --> 00:21:26.250
Robert, you look excited. Would you like to try it out? I'd love to try it. He

447
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.489
absolutely.

448
00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:31.449
Whose glasses are you using? This is the Oculus Rift. OK.

449
00:21:31.459 --> 00:21:33.800
So you're using the Oculus Rift, right? Oculus Rift?

450
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.900
You can interface with the different types of video platforms. That's right.

451
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.780
Be careful when you pick up when you get in, you better give Robert a vomit bag.

452
00:21:42.189 --> 00:21:45.859
All right. Now, I'm gonna set up the connect. What's it like in there? Robert?

453
00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:48.780
It's very cool. So Robin the gun is just a trigger.

454
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.530
So you aim at your look and there's a very cool.

455
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.020
-- Oh,
-- wow.

456
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.219
Run dermal. Run

457
00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.189
look. He's back in Croatia.

458
00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.739
-- Kevin come out and
-- play

459
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:01.189
Kenneth.

460
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:04.949
All right.

461
00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:05.800
Very

462
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.979
cool. Feels very, very immersive. How much is it?

463
00:22:08.989 --> 00:22:12.890
We're selling those on our website right now for $499. That's it.

464
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.839
That's cheaper than I would have thought. How many have you sold?

465
00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:17.849
So, we launched this product on Kickstarter and

466
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.180
we raised $1.1 million. Wow.

467
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.660
How many units are you gonna have to deliver? Close to 3000.

468
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.819
Thank you very much, John. That was awesome. Great.

469
00:22:26.949 --> 00:22:28.739
It was very cool. Very, very cool.

470
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.349
-- Where do you see how uncool you looked up there when you win,
-- when you were on there?

471
00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:36.089
I was, but I don't know if I was winded because I didn't know how to use it.

472
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.839
-- I think once you got used to it, you'd
-- be fine.

473
00:22:37.849 --> 00:22:41.189
Do you think that uh, guys who play games like this want to exercise?

474
00:22:41.199 --> 00:22:43.520
Because usually they have a side job as a plus size model.

475
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.579
-- Most guys who are
-- well play games, nobody likes being overweight.

476
00:22:47.589 --> 00:22:50.900
People would like to be fit, but gamers, they don't like to exercise.

477
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.449
We can play games and lose weight and burn calories at the same time.

478
00:22:54.459 --> 00:22:56.959
People are excited about it. There's a weight loss machine as well.

479
00:22:56.969 --> 00:22:58.760
Is that what you're thinking? Absolutely.

480
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.030
But there's a bigger issue, right?

481
00:23:01.119 --> 00:23:03.589
This is pretty much based around Oculus Rift, right?

482
00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:07.079
As Oculus Rift goes, you guys go, can you tell me what that is Oculus

483
00:23:07.209 --> 00:23:08.719
Rift? That's the headset.

484
00:23:08.729 --> 00:23:11.750
The rift is basically what started this virtual reality revolution.

485
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.900
They've done a phenomenal job of allowing you to put on a headset

486
00:23:15.015 --> 00:23:18.645
and be in an immersive world. Is that included in the price?

487
00:23:18.655 --> 00:23:19.704
It's not included in the price

488
00:23:20.474 --> 00:23:20.694
for that

489
00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:25.724
$300. Is the gun included? The gun is off the shelf, you can buy it online.

490
00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:30.125
It sounds like it's gonna be an 8 to $900 cost, which is quite a bit.

491
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.660
Why don't you tell us why you're worth $20 million today?

492
00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:36.030
I mean, no one's addressed that. I

493
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.459
think it's the elephant in the room.

494
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.859
That's a ridiculous valuation for this. Let me walk you through the numbers.

495
00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:44.739
The rift is an analog for our product. Same target market, same people.

496
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.579
They're selling 200 of these per day right now.

497
00:23:47.589 --> 00:23:50.939
Their projects to do 500,000 units in sales next year.

498
00:23:50.949 --> 00:23:54.420
If we convert one out of 20 buyers of the rift, well,

499
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.939
we will be selling 25,000 units next year, which is $12.5 million

500
00:23:58.064 --> 00:23:58.844
sales.

501
00:23:59.114 --> 00:24:02.244
There's a fundamental difference though, when I buy the headgear,

502
00:24:02.255 --> 00:24:03.944
I can still sit around and lounge.

503
00:24:03.954 --> 00:24:07.165
You're forcing me to stand and you're forcing me to be interactive.

504
00:24:07.405 --> 00:24:09.915
I don't think people want to be that interactive. I sold three

505
00:24:10.025 --> 00:24:10.175
times

506
00:24:10.405 --> 00:24:13.604
on the number just without a product. We can debate the merits of the product.

507
00:24:13.614 --> 00:24:15.125
I'm just trying to look at the sheer number.

508
00:24:15.135 --> 00:24:18.275
You want me to pay your value two years from now. Today,

509
00:24:18.515 --> 00:24:19.724
here's my thinking on it.

510
00:24:19.734 --> 00:24:23.055
If my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately.

511
00:24:24.459 --> 00:24:24.479
I

512
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.829
think it's a problem because of its size in the home.

513
00:24:26.839 --> 00:24:29.810
I also think it's a tremendous problem to sell this in retail.

514
00:24:29.819 --> 00:24:32.060
I sell a lot of product now through retail,

515
00:24:32.069 --> 00:24:34.260
I couldn't get anybody to give the floor space to this.

516
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.699
You'd pay so much just to demonstrate it. But I think that's a concern.

517
00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:40.780
You have to realize that 50% of the population is married and

518
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.359
they're gonna have to deal with their wife on this one.

519
00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:43.260
So I'm out,

520
00:24:46.239 --> 00:24:47.420
you know, I see the market,

521
00:24:47.859 --> 00:24:51.040
you know, Black Ops did amazing Grand Theft Auto. Right. Breaking records.

522
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:51.099
I,

523
00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:53.560
I see the market but I also don't see somebody playing this

524
00:24:53.569 --> 00:24:55.660
more than an hour or half an hour a day before.

525
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.020
They can't even play anymore because they're out of breath or they're tired,

526
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.189
they just won't revisit it.

527
00:24:59.199 --> 00:25:01.260
So for all those reasons and more,

528
00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:02.150
I'm out,

529
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:07.790
look great product. I will definitely buy one.

530
00:25:08.609 --> 00:25:12.020
But I think I'm an anomaly. You better talk to your wife. She's not a pushover.

531
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.719
Well, we have a big house barber. She'll never see it.

532
00:25:14.089 --> 00:25:17.579
But I don't think that people want to exercise and

533
00:25:17.589 --> 00:25:20.150
immerse themselves in the fiscal world to that degree.

534
00:25:20.349 --> 00:25:22.869
I think if people really want to immerse themselves that way,

535
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.030
I think they'll go outside.

536
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.989
I, I don't buy the premise. I'm out.

537
00:25:27.979 --> 00:25:28.920
I see you going with it,

538
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.560
but it is a sub segment of a subsegment market and it's very expensive.

539
00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:34.459
I look at it and say to myself,

540
00:25:34.469 --> 00:25:37.280
is this a good deal of $20 million where you are right now?

541
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.199
And the answer is no, it's not.

542
00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.380
There's too much risk between your delivery of a consumer product,

543
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:47.189
a retail distribution strategy and your sales, you've got tons of risk,

544
00:25:47.199 --> 00:25:48.290
all kinds of risk.

545
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.189
And I gotta pay tomorrow's price today. I hate deals like that.

546
00:25:51.339 --> 00:25:54.089
I hate it when you make me pay for two years from now.

547
00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:57.900
If everything works today, why would I do that? I'm not an idiot.

548
00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.699
Why would I do that because of the potential you're going to have problems.

549
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:03.219
T, is gonna happen. My friend

550
00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:05.189
and I have to pay for that now.

551
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:05.729
No,

552
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.109
it's an outrage ridiculous. I'm out.

553
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:12.969
I get what you're doing.

554
00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:18.099
I could see you creating 20 million in sales, 25 million in sales with this.

555
00:26:19.219 --> 00:26:19.699
But

556
00:26:20.199 --> 00:26:22.689
you're competing just like headsets are gonna be competing

557
00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:24.930
just like the um consoles are gonna be competing.

558
00:26:24.939 --> 00:26:28.719
You're one more, one more outlet competing for consumer dollars,

559
00:26:28.979 --> 00:26:31.439
you have to push that ball so hard to keep going.

560
00:26:31.449 --> 00:26:35.540
If you haven't told me that there's a way to get to 50 million in sales and in six years,

561
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.280
there's gonna be completely new technology that blows all this away

562
00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.869
for those reasons. I'm out.

563
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.680
Thank you. Thanks guys.

564
00:26:44.689 --> 00:26:45.069
You know,

565
00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:48.640
I look at the experience and what can people learn from what happened here today?

566
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.680
And for me, the lesson is very interesting. Ip, way overpriced.

567
00:26:52.689 --> 00:26:55.199
If you had put this at a 5 million valuation,

568
00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:56.500
it would have been very interesting.

569
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:58.680
Good luck. Thank you, John.

570
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.579
Anybody who pays 20 million for that. Is insane. Gamers are lazy.

571
00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:06.939
Like most human beings, they don't want to exercise,

572
00:27:07.219 --> 00:27:07.869
they don't.
