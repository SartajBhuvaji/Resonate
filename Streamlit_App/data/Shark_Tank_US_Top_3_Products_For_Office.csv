1,spk_1,0.313,1.85925,"Hi, Sharks. Im Justin Beer from Bethesda Maryland. And today Im seeking $300,000 for 4% of my innovative apparel company collars and co 4% sharks. Welcome to business casual. 101. Lets begin. So, you know, this look, were you wearing a dress shirt under a sweater? Its pretty much the go to look for every single guy that works in an office around the world. I lived in New York for 12 years. This is whats called the midtown uniform. Problem is I hated wearing a long sleeved dress shirt under a sweater. It was always hot and uncomfortable and scratchy. I dont even have to spend the time buttoning up my shirt in the morning. And then sometimes you would also get whats called floppy collar where the color just flops down halfway through the day. But worst of all was putting him on a dress shirt under a sweater. It is so annoying. The sleeves always get bunched up my sleeves like right up there by my elbow sharks. I knew there had to be a better way, which is why I invented the dress collar. Polo. Its a stretchy comfortable golf shirt except the top has a firm collar on it. So it gives you that exact same look of a dress shirt, but its really just a comfortable polo sharks. Guys are wearing this with a tie under a blazer with a sweater and even just a slightly more elevated casual look with a Polo Sharks. We are helping guys look stylish and stay comfortable and weve created a new category of shirt. Help me create the next great worldwide brand. Thank you in front of you. We actually have four different color styles."
2,spk_2,1.8931499999999999,1.9216666666666666,Its a nice stretchy material.
3,spk_1,1.9268333333333334,2.0063166666666667,"Yeah, its stretchy  ball. Totally
 breathable. Quite an interesting idea."
4,spk_3,2.01065,2.1168333333333336,Did you say 4%? 4%? 4%? Ok. So sales so far
5,spk_1,2.1278166666666665,2.3703333333333334,"we started last year, weve sold so far 92,000 shirts for $5.4 million direct or direct to consumer all online. What was your profit margin on that? 20%? Net?"
6,spk_3,2.3923166666666664,2.4574833333333337," Wow, thats impressive.
 Yeah. So this is a really,"
7,spk_4,2.4680000000000004,2.7889833333333334,"really well made product. Thank you. Um But theres two things I hate, I hate with all my heart this look, Ive always hated that midtown look and its just not my style. I really hate that look. Another thing is I hate offers at 4% for 300,000. Im out."
8,spk_5,2.817833333333333,3.1393333333333335,"That answer is that all right? Weve had other shirt companies on Shark Tank. However, of all the ones in 14 years, youve had the fastest growth to 5 million. I always consider that a hurdle. Getting to five. Thats a real business. So you must have some execution skills in this story  that others dont have. Youre
 right, Kevin, the, the secret is in our marketing."
9,spk_1,3.139483333333333,3.2089833333333333,"Its in our funnel.  Weve mastered the funnel. Ive been doing this for 20 years.
 Doing what?"
10,spk_4,3.209166666666667,3.22315," For 20
 years?"
11,spk_1,3.2336666666666667,3.3185000000000002,"Business, internet marketing. I had a business to be one of the first check in applications for events."
12,spk_2,3.31865,3.51715,"Let me jump in. I mean, while these are super nice, I think what youre doing is fantastic. I dont think its the right investment for me.  So I wish you good luck and I will purchase these gifts, but Im
 out. Thank you."
13,spk_1,3.5173166666666664,3.5245,"Thank you,"
14,spk_3,3.5376499999999997,3.9248333333333334,"Justin. Im quite shocked because Im in, Im in this business. I own a company called Localized and we basically take big brands global all over the world, this type of product specifically across Asia. Yeah, were seeing growth, but were not seeing it at the stage that youve just taken this business to.  What does it cost to make cost
 to make landed $15? We sell it anywhere from 65 to 75."
15,spk_5,3.925,4.227983333333333,"Ok. Ive never bid at a shirt deal because it Oh sure its such a total commodity. But you have numbers to justify. First time in 14 years, Im gonna make an offer to a shirt deal. I look at it and say 300,004% doesnt even get me out of bed to put a shirt on in the first place. Ill do it for 10%. No,"
16,spk_1,4.250333333333334,4.44665,"Kevin. If it was, if this was an old line private equity deal, old slow growth cash flow. This is a f one of the fastest growing D DC brands in the country. Were going at 28% a month"

19,spk_1,4.537166666666667,4.56765,"I have no other just to make, Im just the only,"
20,spk_3,4.585816666666667,4.83465,"youve completely dismissed an offer that I thought was pretty good. What sort of equity are you talking about? Then you came in with 300,000 for 4% youve dismissed as if Mr Wonderful wasnt even in the room. Thats a"
21,spk_1,4.842833333333333,4.9345,"$3 million. This thing, I pushed it for 7.5 million. Its not worth 7.5 million. Its worth 20."
22,spk_5,4.942483333333333,5.03365,"What is this? What is your free? But  what is
 it? 20%? We made a"

 place."
26,spk_5,5.18365,5.254833333333334,"How are you gonna get the money for inventory? So are you looking to raise or are you looking to?  I need a
 line of credit."
27,spk_1,5.2695,5.512316666666666,"But the other thing that Im looking for is a mentor and somebody to help me grow this thing really to the next level.  This is, you know what
 Ill mentor you. Ill mentor you take the 10% offer the next the next great brand."
28,spk_3,5.5125,5.864166666666667,"I dont know whether you know this market as well as I do. This is beyond Bruton. And the reason why this, this is so brutal is because fashion shifts and moves at a literally rapid rate. And you are up here at the moment and you think youve got the dream ticket coming into Shark Tank. The reality is in 6 to 12 months. This could go out of fashion."
29,spk_4,5.872816666666667,5.894833333333334," Heres the reality, Peter

Then he starts bringing in more. He has a lot of skills. He starts bringing in more. You know, some things dont get sold. He doesnt have a second door like Burlington or any place to get rid of this. And now his inventory starts to chew into his profits and then he realizes, oh, wait a minute, I dont know as much as I thought"
32,spk_1,6.3021666666666665,6.349500000000001,"and styles  that when I
 got in the business."

 Justin,"

 You were gonna go from four to what? Five,"
37,spk_5,6.863483333333334,7.011666666666667,"Justin. Well, why did you just go down to two? Hes out Justin. So look, $300,000 is obviously not enough. So you already have in mind where youre going to go get your additional capital."
38,spk_1,7.03165,7.0875," We need, we need probably a $700,000 line of credit. Thats
 easy."

Kevin and Peter have each offered $300,000 for 10% of Justins Shirt company collar and Co Mark is willing to go in with Peter and has offered an additional $700,000 line of credit, but he wants a bigger chunk of equity than the 4%. Justin came in offering and has asked him to make his best and final offer."

49,spk_1,8.443333333333333,8.583833333333333,5%? I think 10% is too much. I just think 10% when you say

Thats not a good sign from an entrepreneur. You do have to listen. You can dismiss it and you can walk out of here. Thats absolutely fine. But we should be allowed to voice our opinion and youre not allowing me to voice mine because you keep talking over me, which lets me know that youre not listening. You have everything right now in the palm of your hand and for 6% thats all that were talking about. 6%. Have, you have no idea what the scale of the opportunity is and what were gonna add and the value to that  youre discounting
 it."

58,spk_4,9.825166666666666,9.903500000000001,So youre talking to guys whove been in the business 30 years. We see deals like this all day long.

81,spk_7,12.284500000000001,14.347166666666668,"Hey, do you want to be quiet? We, were trying to pit the sharks. All right. All right. Ah, thats better. Thats better. Try to go. Hi, Sharks. Im Anthony Pucci and Im Nick Pucci. Were from Los Angeles, California and were seeking $350,000 for 10% equity in our company sharks. Its probably been some time since you worked in a cubicle or even sat in an open office desk. But did you know most offices today feature an open design plan while its great for collaboration and cutting costs, most employees are less productive because of it and thats because employees are dissatisfied with their work environment. In fact, a lack of sound and visual privacy is by far and away. The biggest strain on employee morale introducing cubic call at um the modern phone booth cubicle is the efficient solution to the shortcomings of the design of modern day offices. Our booth focuses on the four pillars of privacy needs, audio, visual, territorial and information. So distractions like these girl become a thing of the past and our cubicle booths are fully customizable. They can be finished in a variety of colors, materials and even custom graphics and those by folding doors allow cubicle to fit into offices where every inch of space is critical. So sharks invest in us so we can help employers invest in their employees. Which one of you wanna come down and get a privacy break from Mr Wonderful and test drive one of the, I wanna try it. Let me thank you. No, we are not doing this again. Oh, sorry. Excuse me? Oh, wow. There you go. Its, its really, well, were you saying anything inside Robert? You cant hear a thing in there. You can hear"
82,spk_6,14.371483333333334,14.380500000000001,whats going on

84,spk_7,14.5075,14.828333333333335,"ah, can you guys hear them ba, each booth comes with an air circulation fan, comes with a regular outlet so you can plug in a laptop and two USB chargers.  Why dont you walk us
 through the numbers? So we sell the first one there, which is our cubicle two. We sell it for 6009 95. Oh,"
85,spk_5,14.846,14.921483333333333," $10,000. And what does it cost you to make? It
 cost us $4200 to make?"
86,spk_7,14.942316666666667,14.99765,"And how about the big one? The big one is 11,009 95."
87,spk_5,15.010666666666667,15.059149999999999," What was the cost of the 11 K 1?
 That ones 7200?"
88,spk_7,15.070316666666667,16.02681666666667,"Now, wait a minute. The competition are relative to that. Theyre selling theirs for about $15,000. So, Nick, how did you start? The company? Tell us? So, we started our own marketing agency. It was an open plan office and its a family business. So were Italian So we talk very excitedly. We come on just got to the point where any important calls or any meetings that we had, we either had to leave the office to take it. We had to stay, stay home. I said, we cant deal with this anymore. And after we put in our office and clients came in, they said, hey, can you give me one of these? I said, yeah, sure. Once you deliver it, do you just simply plug it in? And it works because they do have to be assembled as far as we actually have a video if you guys wanna see it. Yeah, its quickly being assembled. You guys, right? With a little practice. Yeah. Ships flat. Its super easy to assemble. Nick. Have you sold a bunch of them already? Yes, we have, we sold about 70 booths. We sold your sales last 12 months, uh last 12 months, $495,000."
89,spk_2,16.033666666666665,16.068316666666668,And when did you start the business?
90,spk_5,16.071166666666667,16.1,Last August? How are you selling it
91,spk_7,16.10781666666667,16.165483333333334,"uh  directly direct to the end user online? I like the
 solution."
92,spk_5,16.165666666666667,16.473166666666668,"But theres a huge problem here. Youre making $1800 on the six K version. Your margins are so thin that the only way this business works is selling direct to customers. Yeah, but this, this is working for them. Why would they end up working guys? Its not working. Youve only sold $495,000 in business for a year."
93,spk_7,16.492833333333333,17.206833333333336,"How do you feel about the margins? Can you widen your margins? We definitely can. If we get the investment able to invest in the inventory, well be able to add another 20 to 30%. Whats the vision? Whats year two gonna look like? I mean, we wanna get to $2.5 million next year. Thats about 300 booths. And we think with an investment, we can definitely do that. Do  you have
 competition right now? In the whole market? Theres probably about four competitors that we compete with. Nobody does a bi fold door. It sounds trivial, but youre putting these in because space is an issue. Ok. That makes sense. Yeah, but you dont think that a steel case could come in and undercut all of the parts of this and bring the price down by 50%. I think they could, but they wont hit these price points in these margins. I find that hard to believe."
94,spk_5,17.242816666666666,17.676066666666667,"But congratulations on what youve accomplished. Its, its great, obviously, but Ive got a couple of issues. One, its capital intensive two when youre just getting started. Its not unusual, particularly for some when youre cheaper to get orders direct online. But I think youre gonna have to go to some, some other type of two tier contribution. That doesnt mean it wont be a great business for you two, it just means its harder to invest and harder to get a return. And so for those reasons outs,  congratulations

96,spk_2,17.918316666666666,18.134166666666665,"I totally get it. My only problem is there are competition out there that are already doing it. And so I think Im gonna wait a really long time for a return on my investment. So, unfortunately, Im a"
97,spk_7,18.152333333333335,18.438983333333333,"ok, thank you. We appreciate it, appreciate it. I mean, just to sort of paint the picture. So they do say that 80% of all offices are open plan offices. Now, by estimates, theres maybe about 9.1 million businesses, you know, in the US. If we were even to sell one booth to point 1/10 of 1% of those businesses,"
98,spk_5,18.43948333333333,18.774483333333333,"everybody says that about a big market. Yes, thats a kiss of death on the shark tank. When you say all you need is 1/10 of 1%. That thats never a good sign. Im gonna make you an offer but its commensurate with the risk. Ok? Ill give you 350,000. I want 10% of the company. Heres how I get paid back."
99,spk_2,18.77465,18.836483333333334,"You realize they came in asking for 10%.  Im
 not finished yet."
100,spk_5,18.846333333333334,19.217666666666666,"Silence, please. Every time you sell one of these units, I get $100 after I recover 1,050,000, which is three times on the original investment, it drops to $50 a unit forever. Just what you want in a low margin business. Look, its commensurate with the risk here. Maybe Barbara can do better. Anthony.  You gotta be
 careful. Kevin is a vampire. Hell live forever."
101,spk_7,19.221166666666665,19.49965,"So $50 is gonna last a long time. I have a lot of experience with this. Surprisingly, heres my offer. Its better than his. I think this is so complicated. I dont know what it meant. Its pretty simple, but Im gonna give you the 350,000 for 25% of the business."
102,spk_5,19.535666666666668,19.87865,"Wait, wait. Ouch. Thats much worse than my office. Are you kidding me? Every dollar that comes in, you get 100 bucks and you get triple mine reduces over time. Mark Barbaras forever 25% of the company, you know, Barbara, you $50. Thats very expensive. What do you wanna do? I do now?"
103,spk_0,19.900333333333332,20.00998333333333,Sharks are out. Nick and Anthony have two offers on the table from Kevin and Barbara for their office booth company. Cubicle.
104,spk_5,20.031833333333335,20.1065," What do you wanna do? What do
 you wanna do right now? I want to go in the booth. We can hear you."
105,spk_7,20.144816666666667,20.16815,"You wanna go, well go talk to Booth."
106,spk_2,20.192666666666664,20.332816666666666,"Ah, this is hilarious. Theyre using the calculator."
107,spk_5,20.345483333333334,20.378483333333335,"Oh, Lord, welcome back."
108,spk_7,20.39765,20.66865,"Did you guys hear us by each other? Ok. What did you guys figure out? So, Kevin, we really appreciate your offer. Uh, its a little too difficult for me to figure out and for the eventual sell of the company,  its not
 a problem when you sell the company because they just buy out my royalty."
109,spk_5,20.668833333333335,20.778650000000003,"Thats what happens. Many of my companies thats happened. $1 billion go on a little  too
 complicated. So, Barbara,"
110,spk_7,20.78966666666667,21.368833333333335,"we would like to counter with 350 for 15%. Its uh not enough. Im afraid Ill have to turn that down. Yeah, I expect to do a lot of heavy lifting on this business and I have tremendous contacts in the contract furniture space and I think I can make the right introductions for you. Cant budge on the equity at all. Uh No, because I wanna be excited about it. What do you wanna do? How about, could we do 450 for 20? No, I really, I feel like I need that quarter slice to get really juiced up about it."
111,spk_5,21.384166666666665,21.54315,"Maybe you should revisit my offer because it has merit actually should think about. It doesnt sound like shes gonna budge  Anthony.
 I dont think these guys are budging. What are you guys gonna do?"
112,spk_7,21.553983333333335,22.053316666666667,"What do you want now? Yeah. Ok, Barbara, wed like to take the deal. Good move. Its a good deal for everybody. Thank you. I appreciate it. My pleasure. Thank you. I appreciate it. I think we got a great shark and Barbara with her contacts. I think its gonna do wonders for our business. I see the point with the risk but I think its, I think were gonna do great with it."

114,spk_6,22.28281666666667,23.36865,"Hi, Sharks. My name is Bing Howenstine and Im the CEO of all 33. Im here today to ask for $500,000 for a 2.5%. Hello. Piece of our company. Bing baby. I know it is a very serious ask, but thats because it is for a very serious problem. Chairs. They may be killing you. Now, youve all heard sitting is the new smoking. Well, they are right. Sitting for any length of period of time is really bad for you and chairs. Well, theyve had the same basic design for almost 3000 years, whatever youre sitting in. Even the fancy expensive chairs you guys are sitting in right now, you can find yourself locked, stuck, immobile and a lot of times in pain and for all of us working at home these days, this is just not ok. Well, I have some really good news for you. Oh, all 33 is here to save the day, but dont just take it from me. Lets hear what one of our biggest fans has to say."
115,spk_8,23.416483333333336,23.770833333333332,"Hey, Sharks, Im Justin Bieber and this is the all 33. Its the chair that moves like I do. I mean, guys, look at this perfect posture, got my chest up my shoulder back. Im waiting for you? I mean, have you guys ever seen a chair that could do this? Im doing a full ab workout right now. All right. Hit me up later. Ill be back if you gotta sit. This is it"
116,spk_6,23.807166666666667,24.352666666666668,"now, Justin knows what hes talking about because this is our patented sit in motion technology. Its like a chair within a chair and it rocks just like our sales about. You dont have to have moves like Justin in order for this chair to work for you because all you have to do is sit, get fit and all 33 of your vertebrae. Well, theyre gonna keep moving all day now. This is a chair now, Mr Wonderful. Youre looking particularly uncomfortable. I am.  Would you like to come up and see
 what were talking about?"
117,spk_5,24.352833333333333,24.423333333333336," I have a bad back from a squash injury. Oh,
 well, then lets see what happens."
118,spk_6,24.428316666666667,24.58948333333333,"Make sure you get your behind all the way into the back of the chair. Scooch back there. All right.  And you can probably feel the rocking motion move back and forth. Very
 interesting."
119,spk_5,24.601816666666664,24.646166666666666,Why is this making me sit up straight? Why is that happening?
120,spk_6,24.651316666666666,25.08448333333333,"So, the, the patterns that we have about this are really quite unique. Basically, Doctor Dennis Colonel who invented this. Hes been doing this for a long, long time. Hes got 45 years of treating backs necks and everything else he figured out. Lets get your hips moving almost as if what youre experiencing is, is, is a sensation thats almost like youre standing. But when youre sitting, it is moving all 33 of your vertebrae while youre sitting. And theres nothing else in the world that is doing."
121,spk_5,25.08465,25.343316666666666,"Im very skeptical about all these claims on chairs because Ive tried so many and I also have tried different devices that way back. This thing actually is working. I dont care about Bieber. Im gonna kick his ass when an eye album comes out.  I dont like your valuation though. Well, we can
 talk about that."
122,spk_6,25.344816666666667,25.366666666666667," I would expect that from
 you."
123,spk_4,25.368833333333335,25.4125,"Tell us how, how did you get into this and what happened?"
124,spk_6,25.412666666666667,25.908333333333335,"So I have been a patient of Doctor Colonels for about 20 years and then friend, Im also a bit of a serial entrepreneur. I got into making products and getting products sold along the way. I got into the back hair space when I sat on Denniss chair, an early prototype. I said this is a whole different ball game, but I knew that Dennis was never gonna get this thing going as a friend. I said, let me help you. Im gonna do a Kickstarter for you. So we did that.  It performed very well. Whats very well? We did $800,000.
 Thats very"
125,spk_4,25.909483333333334,26.028983333333333,"great. Did you license it from him? No partners with him. I own a small piece of it.  How much of the company do you
 own? I own about 5%."
126,spk_7,26.031833333333335,26.176,"So a premium chair in todays market sells for roughly $2000. A real premium chair.  What does this sell for?
 Were selling this for 799."
127,spk_5,26.178,26.2405," Whats your margin? Whats it cost you to make?
 So, our margins about 67%."
128,spk_6,26.248,26.332," Uh our cost delivered to a customer with all that good stuff is about 260
 bucks. 2.5%."
129,spk_5,26.33216666666667,26.415000000000003,"500,020 million valuation. Yep. How many chairs are you selling? How many dollars?"
130,spk_6,26.415166666666668,26.4925," So, this year alone, weve sold about 3.2 million. Were on track to hit 5.5.
 Ok."
131,spk_5,26.492666666666665,26.526149999999998," And what are you gonna make on five and a
 half?"
132,spk_6,26.52648333333333,26.633333333333333,"So we were, uh, uh, slightly profitable in the second quarter and we expect be the same in this uh,  third
 quarter."
133,spk_5,26.6335,26.982166666666668,"I mean, just help me because, you know, Im, Im a quick study in, in most sectors, um, office supply furniture or even if you wanna call this high end chair design, whatever, maybe it would trade for 11 times pre tax cash flow. I mean, Im not saying it isnt a great chair but its a chair.  Why is it worth 20 million
 dollars?"
134,spk_6,26.983666666666668,27.227333333333334,"We are looking at comps for other companies that are out there in a very similar space that are 3 to 4 times revenue. We know were gonna get there. We have also talked to the market, not my opinion, 20 million bucks is a pretty good valuation. So then why are you here?"
135,spk_4,27.229166666666668,27.285666666666668,"Why am I here? If you talked to so many people that gave you that valuation, why are you here?"
136,spk_6,27.292983333333332,27.327333333333335,Because shark money is better than other money?
137,spk_4,27.3275,27.391833333333334,"So youre charging us more than no sales because with sharks,"
138,spk_6,27.392,27.52665,"Im prepared to give you a discount because you guys are sharks and you give a discount. Im the CEO of the company and Im here to make a deal.  Youre
 a marketing company, first and foremost, youve got,"
139,spk_5,27.526816666666665,27.780816666666666,"youve got your product, right? Its got its angle, its got its differentiation and thats good. Right? I just dont wanna be in the chair business. Sure. You know, its just of all the businesses big and small, not that theres anything wrong with the chair business, but its just not for me. Um So for those reasons, Im out."
140,spk_6,27.790333333333333,27.80815,Thats fair. Thank you.
141,spk_7,27.817816666666666,28.11466666666667,"If you had come in here today and you wanted to sell me a chair, youre the perfect guy, but you werent here to sell a chair. You were here to sell a business, correct? You said you were a 5% owner, correct? I for some reason feel it lacks credibility. Ok? I think thats a good lesson for other entrepreneurs. You cant send a salesman here."
142,spk_6,28.118483333333334,28.569000000000003,"Well, with all due respect, this is my life right now. And to, you know, its a bit of a denigration to call me a simple salesman on this deal.  Barbaras very
 good at pissing everybody off. Thats fair. You can do that. But the fact is thats not, is that is not what is happening here. Im here to build a company. We are building a movement in a category that hasnt been done before. Were going up against the big guys that, you know, frankly, its a fractured system that I look forward to breaking."
143,spk_7,28.569666666666667,28.75883333333333,"I wish I could believe that youre building a category, but I dont see that as a category. I see it as a chair with a new design element, but it doesnt get me all excited. So for that reason,"
144,spk_6,28.783666666666665,28.793316666666666,thank you.
145,spk_2,28.804166666666667,29.408833333333334,"The problem for me is whenever somebody comes in and they have something different that can really be good, but theyre just starting and they wanna get a shark. I always feel the smart thing to do is to be a lot smarter about your valuation because if you get somebody in and alongside with you, you could take a one off item like this and blow it up, which is what Im good at. So if you had had something that was just more realistic because youre, I, I just feel its so out of whack for me, it just turns me off. And for that reason, unfortunately, Im out"
146,spk_6,29.422816666666666,29.578,"thats fair. There is a competitor company that just had a $200 million valuation on, you know, just  a little higher
 sales. I actually, I actually work with one of the bigger guys, uh,"
147,spk_4,29.587316666666666,29.842499999999998,"very desk and the whole, uh, theory is the desk raise up and the chairs that, you know, they sell are a little pole, a chair. So you have to balance yourself. Right. Um, this would be a conflict, uh, with me. So Im out,"
148,spk_5,29.889666666666667,30.044500000000003,"I started choking on the valuation and Im still choking on it. I tried the chair and it has merit but 500 K for 2.5%.  I dont get out of bed for 2.5
 percent."
149,spk_6,30.051483333333334,30.11231666666667,"Well, I cant do it. Im happy to have you in a higher place in the cap table."

151,spk_6,30.244333333333334,30.353483333333333,"Ok. Thank you very much. I will buy one though. Well, uh youre gonna have to pay full price this time, I guess I will."
152,spk_5,30.385833333333334,30.41365,"All right. Thank you, Bing"
153,spk_6,30.447816666666665,30.64016666666667,"to have Barbara. Just call me a salesman. I think that was a bit offensive and, you know, I dont think any entrepreneur wants to hear that when you put your blood sweat and tears into something. Um, I, I find that uh particularly, you know, not cool."
