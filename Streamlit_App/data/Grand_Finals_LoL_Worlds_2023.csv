1,spk_1,0.20033333333333334,0.4098333333333333,"And one of the big questions coming in was what is wes plan going to be in game number one seeing that they are the underdogs. It already. We have our answer 100% fakers playing a different champion this time,"
2,spk_0,0.4128833333333333,0.64605,"this was such a discussion point of would Mid lane be that focus mal left available, but you have to know R is available for owner and he has been stellar on it. Theres a lot of options here. Bot lane focus could be big as well and theyre gonna  do it right away.
 And this is the thing."
3,spk_2,0.6462,1.0251,"The Callister has been such incredible priority. It was something actually used against T one in the JDG series. And I think RNA Glas is the most important champion for this series as a whole crisp Inc on the champion Kerry, of course, debuting it in their very first game in the Swiss stage at Worlds So this is very, very important,  especially to see what the rest of Webos plan
 is and not only does it deny crisp,"
4,spk_1,1.02525,1.3758333333333332,"but weve also seen carrier himself be extremely successful on this carrier, Renata uh or uh Renata Calista ra are incredibly hard to deal with. It will be the shy going back to the Atrix, which has to have been the main blind pick. But in game one pulls out is yone also shou well be playing the chase, meaning we get that Malka chase combo that has terrorized the rift all year."
5,spk_0,1.3759833333333333,1.5258333333333334,"Yeah, this is going to be incredibly exciting getting the yone here. Game one in the finals. T one getting spicy already.  And how is
 it? Actually"
6,spk_2,1.53,1.8223166666666666,"the yone P? Thats the question because Faker has played, I, I believe he celebrated his 70th unique champion this year. Um, people have been talking about fake champion po, its a really interesting topic, right? Because we dont know how much hes been practicing recently, but I think hes played the most champions professionally  out of any other person on the
 planet."
7,spk_0,1.8224833333333335,2.2495,"Exactly. I mean, this guy is the consumer professional. Hes such a grinder. Hes been back from his injury quite some time. You have to give him that respect that he can play everything. It is going to be such a focus down towards bot lane though. Now, as T one are the ones blinding their bot lane, theyre gonna be banning away the virus. The Ash two of those really highly prized picks crisp has been playing more of the though hes moved towards things like Lux and Jer when Renato was gone. So Im going to be interesting to see where he actually takes us.  Im
 also really big fan of the"
8,spk_1,2.2514833333333333,2.755333333333333,"Bes here from Weibo because we now have, I think owners best champions all gone. The R and the J four at the front, but also was quite strong and taking that away might put owner in a tough situation. And he has been the player that improved so much throughout or red from so to the world championship putting him in uh in a difficult position, could be a big win as it is the Ari for Faker.  So
 Fakers Ari coming out and it does immediately make you"
9,spk_0,2.7555,3.0894833333333334,"think could it be a vie as that last pick? You know, the, the V Ari Perry has been so popular throughout the year. Uh Theres also an angle to play like a Poppy or something like that if we get more dash style champions, uh coming out from Webo, but its gonna be SE TK just trying to neutralize this bottom line here and this is how its gonna do.  Yeah, this is
 something that a lot of people have been talking about as well."
10,spk_2,3.0896666666666666,3.3733166666666667,"The fact that light and crisp can go back to this style weve seen already that they can play it to great effect. Well see what the answer is going to be though, hard engage into the to Kench is, uh, something that can be a little bit difficult if it is single target. So maybe not the vie here and maybe it could be the Poppy for owner will see where he decides"
11,spk_0,3.3764833333333333,3.41865,to go. I feel like could actually be a pretty good answer.
12,spk_3,3.466666666666667,3.5329833333333336," All right. Um, well, that is definitely a choice you can
 make in game number one."
13,spk_2,3.533166666666667,3.603666666666667,"Of course, this is owners most famous champion by a country mile."
14,spk_1,3.603816666666667,4.200366666666667,"And something that uh for t one was a really big surprise for me was that when you look at the way that they beat JDG, it wasnt just with the style of comps, they actually opted into more team fighting this time around though. This comp needs to win in the early game. Faker and owner Guma carry out. They need to start stacking dragons. They need to get ahead early because if you get to, its a late game. Look at the front to back on Weibo, right? This is a composition thats really hard to engage into. And if t would ever lose map control trying to get on to Makai, trying to take down individual car, uh, targets against the Kench is going to be  extremely difficult
 when youre second to those objectives with"
15,spk_0,4.204866666666667,4.556266666666667,"Makai saplings in every brush, you can be getting poked out by the Jays, which could be difficult, but both teams lacking a little bit as far as the hard G goes. But T one does have the ability to pick people off, you know, with the lease and with the, with the re they want to be moving around the map, they want to be pushing out lanes, catching people in transitions, taking these skirmishes  as often as they can and we are just moments away from getting onto the rift.
 Exactly."
16,spk_2,4.556416666666666,5.0595,"Game number one is upon us. Of course, he won a lot of finesse possibilities with a composition like this. But I look at Webos draft and I think weve seen these styles of draft so many times in the past. Staying tried and true as we head onto the rift for our very first game T one coming out swinging and Weebo, I think ready to pick up that punch. See exactly how it is going to go. Worlds 2023. Game  number one.
 Lets do it"
17,spk_0,5.083,5.415333333333334,"and all Ive got to point out its triple TP for Webo. Chris is gonna be taking the tee on that Tom Kench. So feeling that they cant get necessarily get pressured heavily enough to actually get killed. If he feels hes gonna get chunked out. Hey, you tee back early, you know, you keep up that farm as much as you possibly can, but its gonna give the advantage in playing that map because they will have that extra T bo come mid in lake. It,"
18,spk_1,5.423316666666667,5.587866666666667,"another thing here is what is the level one to be? I think that one of the other really underrated parts of the SAN  is how strong the level one is.
 Exactly right. But just a reminder"
19,spk_2,5.590033333333333,5.750183333333334,"to connect your League of Legends account with prime gaming to grab the exclusive W mode. And if you havent done it already by good, I mean, this is just do it, just do it now.  That would be
 fantastic."
20,spk_1,5.752183333333333,6.081066666666667,"Its a really good amount and you saw there as well, no opportunity for, for we to use it at least for now, although they might come through. But I do think that the level one of Weibo is so strong and they are clearly expecting this. So t one I think very smart not to  opt into this and take the risk in game one of the finals and
 they were pretty good"
21,spk_2,6.081216666666666,6.36225,"at utilizing Tom Kench in that level one play if we remember back to it as well. So certainly no shenanigans this time around I in game number one. That is a good idea f on his fourth unique champion here for worlds in game number one of the final. But of course, Ari is one that hes been famous for for many years."
22,spk_0,6.362433333333333,6.5822666666666665,"And I think theres gonna be so many eyes on the mid lane because Shau has not been performing to the level that people were hoping for from him. You know, he hasnt been having that incredible tournament but now here in his first ever world finals, hes got to step up if its gonna be, we win."
23,spk_2,6.592766666666666,6.864316666666666,"Exactly. Well, piercing darkness coming through there from light. Not too much. Just a little bit of a tussle, a little bit of checking each other on the bottom side of the map as fake are now trying to push forward. Shau just  having an OK time here as the chase into
 the A E"
24,spk_1,6.866166666666667,7.349816666666666,"And well see, uh if were going to see Ambre where were going to see the early jungle attention. Because I think for T one obviously, selfexplanatory dragons and Heralds are incredibly important to pick up early, but there is an opportunity to try and go for these aggressive plays. I think Weiwei in particular has been really good about consistently finding bottom line angles. Uh Although he is currently passing towards, but well see how T one can cover for Z because he is already shoving in. And if you can get an early kill on the yone, it can really send the behind."
25,spk_0,7.350666666666667,7.567833333333334,"Well, an owner is going to use this to a right. Hes going to win this duel against Weiwei. So hes just gonna try to get right in his face, push him out. He knows he has that pushing top lane and well see how this fight does go.  Yeah,
 nice little side step there to avoid the Sonic wave"
26,spk_2,7.575483333333334,7.726483333333333,"Weiwei just making sure that he can keep that health bar high has actually popped the potion there as well. Its a sapling in the brushes own it just looking to try and wreak havoc.  But
 look at"
27,spk_0,7.728166666666667,8.007333333333333,"Zeus Z is already moving down. Thats why he starts the camp now because Zeus got the push in. Hes gonna come down. So we we is gonna have to back off. He could look for the 5050 but he risks putting himself in danger. So it should be owner grabbing the wolf and they can continue this pressure on. You can look towards mid now and show  is in trouble.
 Owner immediately moves over."
28,spk_3,8.0075,8.121866666666667,"Theres the flex accuses going to land from Moa but he decides to not go in under the inner torrent and shau  to try and fire
 back."
29,spk_0,8.122016666666667,8.432016666666666,"This is just great stuff early on here from T one owner, three camps top moves into the enemy jungle to cover Zeus on the push then uses Zeuss pressure to move down. Steal the wolves rotates over towards mid where faker has that now into a bots side scuttle. This is really clean, really well preplanned play here from T one and"
30,spk_1,8.4322,8.485516666666665,"Im gonna be looking towards how would a jungler  is able to punish the
 elect"
31,spk_3,8.488366666666668,8.697049999999999,"of w is fake against the job. Hes listen to this guys, but I dont think its going to be enough because his flash, its already down and first blood goes to Yahoo  and
 I havent even finished my center. So Weiwei does."
32,spk_1,8.6972,8.828066666666667,"That exact thing punishes faker for being dead far up in the lane  and all they gave up for it was a wolf
 camp and we said"
33,spk_0,8.830549999999999,8.985716666666667,"Yahoo had to have a good series, had to have a good game. And what better start than a first blood on the Spring King from the LP L in his first world final."
34,spk_2,8.994433333333335,9.199250000000001,"And you mentioned it already. Chronicler Xu is a guy thats had a lot of attention from a lot of fans and already starting to silence some of those doubts, but it is very, very early days in this one as we check out the replay really good popping here from Weiwei."
35,spk_0,9.203766666666667,9.422433333333334,"Yeah, this is just great from Weiwei just wraps around, you know, did skip that top side scuttle and I think Ficker potentially thought he was actually over on. It just comes right down pass immediately. There is not gonna be able to get out as faker committed. The flash for that trade earlier on Yahoo."
36,spk_1,9.435666666666666,9.942316666666667,"And if you think back to the spring final or summer finals, rather that t one wasnt able to win, it was in large part because Jenji identified if you get Fager off of some of his conference champions and you put him down early by a lot of repeated jungle attention. It can be a viable way to get an early to mid game lead against Ian and weve seen that they can struggle in that situation and particularly with draft like this, you need to win, you cant try and uh kind of go through the middle, you know, maybe  pick up a Dragon or two. No, you need to be able to dominate from the Get Go. And
 Ari pre"
37,spk_0,9.94465,10.4565,"six is one of those champions that you really can take advantage of. You know, that is why a year was so key 41 in their playoff run. And Wei Wei, its interesting to note that it was that first GK in towards mid, you know, he has been so heavily prioritizing these box side GKS throughout worlds in the LP L. It was much more about playing towards the shy, but at worlds, it has been about playing towards Chris playing towards light and I really wanted to see what his game plan was gonna be coming into worlds because clearly t one movie prep for that.  Well,
 owner gonna clear out some vision as you can see Control Ward in the Drake pit."
38,spk_2,10.456666666666667,11.022816666666667,"First one going to be a Kench Drake and owner is going to very happily join carrier as they look to take this one down. So at about six minutes into the game, we will have our very first dragon Baker coming on over, not gonna be able to steal anything away, just getting some information here for T one. So they will be able to secure this dragon. So that is one of the steps that they have taken here still, theyre gonna need those big advantages like you guys were talking about in order to make this one work. Looking here towards the bottom side, Gui has a huge advantage over the Tom Kench. But something that you would expect,  its not necessarily a lane you can really judge on
 C si mean,"
39,spk_0,11.023,11.354816666666666,"you can see it in both top and bot lane though. You know, these CS differences obviously is the Tom Ken versus that Calista not comparing it with the center, uh, but both top and bot significant CS advantages already here. 41 mid, slightly favored towards faker. Despite the death, they are out farming their opponents and thats why theyre still at this slight amount of goal despite giving up that first blood.  And this is
 something we"
40,spk_1,11.3585,11.573649999999999,"was also able to do. Uh the shy specifically against been, was able to use the fact that the matchup was isolated to push really heavily for Big CS leads and then take those leads into mid game fights and carry them.  And when we talk
 about com"
41,spk_0,11.575333333333333,11.965666666666667,"that are relying on these early game advantages. One of the ways you can do it is just by stacking dragons, youre playing Calista, youre gonna have f side pressure even if you cant establish a massive goal lead. If you take these early dragons and put the pressure of that soul on your opponents, you circumvent a lot of the weaknesses and hard engage that your composition has you draw your opponents to you, you force them to challenge you at these dragons where you are gonna be set up for that fight where you are gonna be in the advantage."
42,spk_2,11.977333333333332,12.605983333333334,"Alright, now it is just a bit of trading in lanes where were gonna go home, collect himself, uh, a book and a control ward. Try to get back to it as Chris the tongue lash, it hurts a whole lot more. Uh I feel like when uh youve got him sitting in a lane by himself for quite some time, but hes actually still just level five, same as everybody else and Gushi still playing aggressively, not able to land too many of these pierces as uh Zeuss soul is relatively unbound as he just keeps shoving these weights relentlessly into the Shires turret. First plate has gone down already here for T one like you were mentioning as they are playing into the advantages in gold that has now ticked up to about 500."
43,spk_1,12.61115,13.171083333333334,"And my expectation is that T one is going to use this top lane prior to secure Harold without too much difficulty. Faker. Almost we flash available. Xu already has his. But with this ax being Perma pushed in, it should make the set up 41 around this objective pretty easy. And they have also already rotated over Guma Yushi and Kara. So they are going to secure this. Then my question becomes, where are they going to throw it down because the two obvious solutions to me would be either Zeus or Guma. Obviously Guma already massively far ahead. But a yone in a side lane I think is one of the biggest things that Weibo might not be able to answer."
44,spk_0,13.1782,13.482533333333333,"I think it should go towards Zeus. He already has the push. This is one of these hyperscale top laner that he already has the early push. You can harass those towers, harass the A rocks with the soul unbound and you get him that big gold lead. This guy can make miracles happen in a five V five  Z has been simply incredible throughout the world championship.
 Certainly has."
45,spk_2,13.482683333333334,13.516183333333334," And now Baker
 is gonna dash in fights. The"
46,spk_3,13.518866666666666,13.751650000000001,"chal on to the Tom C fake has to get out of there though. C the hostile takeover gets so much work done. The De Denver that kills them. Oh, no, its B dashes forward once again.  But it looks like theyll have to settle for one and a Herald
 and"
47,spk_1,13.756666666666666,13.992166666666666,"Webo, they see that T one is at the Herald. They rotate over and I think they try to recuperate, but thats uh song gonna cause fallacy because they just walk up. T one finds the angle and Webo  give up the Herald and kill
 Exactly."
48,spk_0,13.992316666666666,14.03815,And maybe gonna lose some form down on bots side as well. Cos Chris has no TV. But
49,spk_3,14.046,14.24375,"Natures Cross comes in, he gets pulled back. Hes interrupted from the ultimate, he does get a knock up there and a shield, but I think hes still dead and there it is the answering kill from the shwa  able to punch
 back on the top side."
50,spk_0,14.243916666666667,14.480583333333334,"You can see owner hanging around that bottom side, potentially threatening as Guma and carry are going to push it in already have taken a plate themselves down there. But great he back on the top side does help to equalize the gold there for the shot.  Yeah, go
 now actually completely fine."
51,spk_1,14.480766666666666,14.74735,"The shot might even be able to pick up played as well. And crucially, Zais doesnt have TP so actually is going to lose out on this wave, unlike Faker when he was ganged earlier, who is TP back to the lane not going to be the case here. And that is the second time that Weibo, the initial play might not work, but Weiwei pulls it back."
52,spk_0,14.747516666666666,15.16765,"Exactly. And just couldnt use that ultimate quite fast enough, you know. So we we was able to get ahead of him blocks the Al T and then from that point, Ze says, you know what, Im dead either way. So Im gonna hold on to the flash, but it is an unfortunate death for him as he had so much pressure on top side, so much tempo and a lot of that is gonna be lost now but not lost in the mid lane where Faker has continued to push in. Continued this relentless aggression here despite being that first death,"
53,spk_2,15.1775,15.3164,"even though he did pull down first up faker is pretty good at bouncing back from uh initial deaths. The global taunt that hes had for the last 10 years seems to be the thing,"
54,spk_0,15.319083333333333,15.3674,"the most GED  man of all time, I
 think its probably true,"
55,spk_2,15.367566666666667,15.7055,"but also hes played lot like the most games out of anyone else uh that still plays currently. So, um its, its a, its a weird stat uh to go towards bottom side of the map, we do see a reset coming through here for Gushi and Krier. Not quite towards the first item yet for the Calista, which would be pretty important for the next fight coming up,  see what they can get
 for themselves."
56,spk_1,15.705666666666668,15.854333333333333,"Yeah, you see as well already, Weibo is moving up the second Drake I think is really pivotal. Uh There are a lot of good tricks still available for T one. No C tech uh Dragon in particular."
57,spk_2,15.863666666666667,15.940483333333333,"What Drake? Its gonna be, its T one, its cloud, its got to be the cloud. Theyve got the most cloud."
58,spk_1,15.958333333333334,16.2815,"You dont want them to have clouds. So, uh particularly not with the amount of ability on the team. So I think that Weibo is going to try and contest there, but T one still are the ones with control of their pots. Side pro is now being found by light and crisp Harold being placed down just in mid lane to try and pressure Webo out and get a quick move into the river."
59,spk_2,16.288666666666668,16.586316666666665,"Its going to mean that that dragon should belong to T one if they can get control with it. F it sticking around for the cash and we will be able to gather it here. All the deception gonna go wide and it looks like F is not gonna stick around for another plate as we, we gone for reset, theyre gonna give up the second Drake as well.  Yeah,
 I think theres just no real angle for them to contest from this point."
60,spk_0,16.5865,16.8411,"Owner dropped the Herald Mid, they get there, they reestablished Ryo down on that bottom. I move up through the river and with Carrie Guma, its such a strong point early on in the game, it is gonna be cloud salt.  Its
 not a question mark. I uh I did tell you, I, I informed you, I didnt"

62,spk_1,16.9061,17.011100000000003,"that youre right about dragons and the guys are clouds. I gotta say you often are.  And
 do you know who was actually the one that"

 Ive always been a cloud believer. Yeah. Yeah."

73,spk_3,18.8965,18.982483333333334,"shi has done a fair bit of damage but I dont think it is going to be enough as its  Alco gaming
 for the shy and he will go down owner"

I think to be up there. The sh thought he was going to be safe but now dieing there with no TP does mean theres gonna be a pretty big push. You can see Guma, of course you have to carry, compare that with Chris"
76,spk_3,19.30615,19.59,"brings him back in with the twisted advances, the kick back as well as we we gets out the punch and now show coming on it down and no bail out for you lights in a bit of trouble, but the J is not gonna get it done because Crisp is there with the den, the denial with the devour  and he wont have to run away. What a
 play from Webo"
77,spk_1,19.596983333333334,19.76615,and continuously they are getting out skirmish. We we should be able to get the execute here so nothing given up and Webo walk away. Victoria
78,spk_0,19.7699,20.083916666666667,"again. We has just had such an incredible journey as a player. You know, this guy first starting on V five came in with them, played with BLG. And since joining Webo has made such a difference with this team has really transformed, the team has such good pressure in the early stages and him getting going early always spells good things for this team"
79,spk_2,20.087750000000003,20.118916666666667,certainly does. Lets have a look at the play one more time.
80,spk_1,20.129583333333336,20.40198333333333,"And as we look here, initially, it looks like t one wants to back off the way goes very far back, but then crucially barely stays alive, right? And with him getting away, there is no bailout value for owner. And the fact that faker t hes in doesnt matter  because Chris is standing at the ready with
 Theo."
81,spk_0,20.406333333333336,20.657316666666667,"Chris was there and light with some nice little sidesteps. Dont think the charm would have mattered even if it landed because Chris was right behind him, but well played on the sidestep. Nonetheless, he won though continually going towards these objectives, they know they need to keep pushing the pace and Webo here looking to challenge"
82,spk_2,20.663166666666665,20.853316666666668,"and nice shot blast is going to soften up T one just a little bit here. Four versus three. In this moment, the F is wrapping around from the top side of the fight. The shi pretty far away from this one and  Zeus is moving in, gets
 over the wall."
83,spk_3,20.853483333333333,20.931333333333335,"Theres the old,  its going to be dodge as he gets himself out of there
 with the unbound soul and T one,"
84,spk_2,20.931500000000003,20.972316666666664," they are gonna be able to secure the Herald forces the
 flash from"
85,spk_0,20.972483333333333,21.062666666666665,light and they get the Herald really nicely done from T one. That is what has been going their way all game long.
86,spk_1,21.062833333333334,21.539233333333335,"And now Im wondering, can t one also get themselves to this dragon in time? I think just have enough time to still get the backs in, make their way, spend their money and then try and set up this sole point very early on. Because while when it comes to Gold Webo has been able to stay very relevant, if T one picked this up, they will have got every single objective thus far and it will at the very least force Weibo to maybe make some tough decisions. Once say is in the sideline becomes hard to deal with because I  wouldnt be surprised if he ends up going for whole breaker
 again."
87,spk_0,21.5394,22.029666666666667,"And this is such an early sole point that they will be moving to the third dragon here. If they can get it around 17, 17.5 minutes into the game and threatening that 22 23 minutes soul would be a really tough spot here for Webo. So they have to get mid lane control. They have to be able to push this out then move into the river. They want to be first to the scene. You can see we, we trying to keep these down and ra one as they try to move in. But in the bot lane, its Zeus with the push there. And if he can get prior down to that Bo side, they can potentially set up a flank from multiple angles."
88,spk_2,22.035149999999998,22.446416666666668,"Owner should be able to put the Herald down here as well to help them get that mid, get towards that dragon. But you can see we dont want to give up the river right now. Weiwei just standing stalwart. The sh is going to turn up charm is going to connect, but faker probably not wanting to go in on that one. If youre gonna connect from owner and Ti One just keeping up this pressure allowing HBO to move into that river knowing they have Zeus very close to that bottom wave to keep pressure in the lane."
89,spk_0,22.446583333333333,22.69915,"Exactly is threatened. Moving up. He went, just did the gram. Now hes down back towards that bottom lane, pushing that out. So forcing the response from the shy you want are happy in this stalemate. Position right now, they still have the Herald to work with. So if we over commit towards the dragon, they can just drop Harold mid and guarantee thats your one."
90,spk_2,22.70815,22.760316666666665," He is going to
 miss the handshake, but the cue is gonna land from ona."
91,spk_3,22.765,22.975833333333334,"We, we could avoid it with a twisted advance on not going to go in as he ever cross, he gets the devour Gushi, getting himself out of there and utilizing his ultimate to save carrier as well.  But that is so many cool downs
 and now we"
92,spk_2,22.980316666666667,22.99765,started off the Drake. We
93,spk_1,23.00198333333333,23.202916666666667,"might be looking to go for it. Theyve also used a number of cool thumbs themselves, most notably the Shy and Webers ultimate. Well see if T one tries to go for an alternative play. Just push mid, but it looks like  Weel isnt even gonna give them the
 opportunity as, oh"
94,spk_3,23.205083333333334,23.630166666666664,"no man to keep flash show whos gonna be pushed into big of the flash ball. But the charm hes going to miss what? He doesnt let it show, just walks it off. No worries there at all. As crisp is under the turret they throw to Ar Butan has found two with the ultimate light goes down so low, but isnt going to five Weiwei trying to get himself out of there and the shy is given up on Weiwei running the wrong direction but they at least get the dragon"
95,spk_0,23.642816666666665,23.767166666666665,"Weibo, get the dragon but t one get the kill. Shau lucky to get out of that one. But Weiwei, hes going home in the body bag."
96,spk_2,23.784816666666664,24.05933333333333,"That is the final kill there from owner and that is the first fight that t one have won. But theyve lost that dragon stacking that you were talking about earlier chronicler. And so well see whether they can grab that next one and keep this level of pressure up because 2.3000 gold is that enough  of a lead for this early game
 composition."
97,spk_1,24.060833333333335,24.39043333333333,"And there is a reason why owners Lee has been fixed. And the funniest part to me is this play doesnt even matter because Shau actually is able to walk it up. Another miraculous survival faker doesnt get the chase because of Chris. But then its Zeus  who got put down in lane that makes the hero play
 exactly comes in on the other side."
98,spk_0,24.3906,24.808516666666666,"Theres no devour because Chris was over saving his mid, trying to defend there. So light is left vulnerable and light is punished big time. T one getting that major gold injection. And, and you can see a lot of these towers that theyve been pressing. If you look on live faker taking down that top tier one, a lot of these turrets have been getting lower and lower from this T one lane dominance.  Yeah, you can
 see theres a lot of relief on Toms face there as well"
99,spk_2,24.819816666666668,25.169983333333334,"hoping that t one can get this mid game sorted out. Owner stealing away some raptors, full vision given over to Webo 3.5 minutes on the clock when it comes to the uh Drake. As in goes, Zaius Shou just uh bots him away and owner is gonna come through as well. Shahu in still a lot of trouble. Safeguard comes in. Shau  moving
 away from the lease"
100,spk_3,25.172316666666667,25.31638333333333,"to the skies, comes down. The devourer is there. It was crisp coming forward and he saves his mid line up. But that is  lot invested. Thats
 the problem is that even though Xu"
101,spk_1,25.321199999999997,25.6157,"makes it out alive, crisp uses TP and theyre not even going to be able to save deterrent. So even though isnt able to actually clip Xiao who he sidesteps the ultimate, its still a big win and the whole breaker is in fact done and it makes him such a menace in the sideline.  Exactly.
 Its incredibly difficult to deal with them."
102,spk_0,25.61638333333333,25.814583333333335,"They become incredibly tanky and one of the most underrated parts about this is how tan it actually makes the Canon minions. They become very difficult to actually wave clear out a lot,  be
 in a bit of trouble here as Chris looks for it,"
103,spk_2,25.81475,25.89575,"the immediate cleanse does get out of the way.  Natures
 cross isnt gonna connect, but there is the twisted even hostile"
104,spk_3,25.902083333333334,26.33915,"takeover across everyone over the shy. Its just gigantic gua trying to hop away, defeats all the knock ups. And meanwhile, we we is going down Baker collects it before bowling down. Chris has to go though because hes so incredibly low and say is tearing them to shreds. We O LA oh, now is t one look to tidy up Chris and they won that team fight even better than the loss.  Guma refuses to
 go down."
105,spk_0,26.345833333333335,26.43681666666667,"Kia saves him. Coming in with a  will take over a T one. Theyre on
 the Baron and its Renada"

 does it again. Kia"
107,spk_1,26.467983333333333,26.796166666666668,"standing at the ready keeps Guma alive throughout all of it. And T one, the goal before this was even Weel picked up the dragon. But after this fight, multiple goal, uh kills going over the T one barn secured and it looks like the first game might have been broken open the early get comp getting it done"
108,spk_2,26.805816666666665,26.916150000000002,"and here is the replay. Well see how it all started. It looked like a pick on the  Gushi. It
 did but it just took them so long to actually get to him."
109,spk_0,26.916316666666667,27.233933333333333,"You can see everyone from T one is coming as fast as they possibly can. And all the time that was bought here by Guma allows them to arrive, allows the hostile takeover here hitting across multiple members. Light is forced to even flash out just trying to avoid it. But owner knocks him down, Guma dances out using that ultimate with carry as hell to peel them off."
110,spk_1,27.23725,27.53925,"And were seeing one of the big issues with the Sana is that if youre playing a front to back, Sana feels almost impossible to deal with, particularly with Ken. Its really hard to take people down to get through the front line, the K backs. Amazing. But if you get caught, particularly by something like Ali, you dont get to play the game"
111,spk_2,27.544266666666665,27.836366666666667,"and also they werent playing front to back League of Legends. It was a entirely with the fact that the shi goes in is in the middle and it felt fantastic, right? It was a bit of a split there from Webo with their decision making moving forward. It could mean that they could adjust that, moving into the next team fight and really show what this composition can do."
112,spk_0,27.840700000000002,28.122149999999998,"And the tough thing for Webo is, is, it felt like so many things did go well for them in the early stages though skirmishes were working for them. But when T one hit T one hit way harder and they have gotten so much out of these last couple of plays, theyre gonna try to take a tier one top.  A figure is looking for a gauge spot.
 Yeah. Looking for even more"
113,spk_2,28.125666666666667,28.146666666666665,"pro  whos going to land
 somehow."
114,spk_3,28.146833333333333,28.223983333333333,"That charm didnt connect,  but it is still going to gather
 a devour from over the wall from Crisp"
115,spk_2,28.23098333333333,28.255316666666666,Twan will settle for this in A T
116,spk_1,28.262316666666667,28.803483333333336,"and this is where the earlier Drake from Webo is gonna feel like a miracle in the sky, right? If they didnt have, that would be just as soul in addition to all the turrets that are there. 41 now. Sure. Uh, theyre not gonna have to solve. You still have five minutes of time. Its not looking great, but at the very least theyll have one more opportunity to try and get something going. My main issue is particularly with Zeus now, completely back in the game and sitting on a pretty ludicrous gold advantage. Uh three K  in the side line, its gotta be
 untouched."
117,spk_0,28.80365,29.29175,"I mean, even in the team fight, he just finished an IE, hes got three full items. Now the shai just finishes Dereks second. And when you have the IE and you can talk about not wanting a team fight with a whole breaker. But when youve got an IE and a cr and you can one hit the back line, this becomes incredibly hard to actually fight against this guy. So if T one can execute on those 55 as they have been doing all tournament long, we saw it showcased against JDG against the worlds best in that five B five stage that its gonna be tough for way. Look at Kia"
118,spk_2,29.3034,29.7215,"dancing forward, but like you say, KA L in the side line, we just trying to deal with these many ways not wanting to give up more than they can afford to lose. T one just gonna gather themselves a little bit of extra standing goal in a tart, not exactly the end of the world, but its all just more money here for the coffers of T one. The shock blast starting to land a little bit lands on a fake of there. But theyre gonna need more of those. If they want to stop the pressure,"
119,spk_0,29.725166666666667,30.20221666666667,"the shock blasts do hurt. But T one is just playing so intelligently around this. They dropped that pink or a mid Z is playing very far back because no one is answering top. You know, as T one, the only recourse in this game we will have is to overload one side of the map. Get a three V one, get a two V one, get a pick kill, then attack the rest of the T one squad. So until they show top, theres no reason for Z to walk up, he just plays it so far back, plays it calm, cool and collected and allows his team to get those incremental advantages up in top lane.  And
 this is now turned into an 8000 gold lead,"
120,spk_2,30.202366666666666,30.507266666666666,"the rebel Baron power play just kind of gigantic given the fact that it was relatively close for a lot of this game. So do really like to break open games, especially in the past when they were at their most. Do definitely a good sign if you are a T one fan and Weebo well and truly on the ropes here at this stage of the game."
121,spk_1,30.512249999999998,30.87091666666667,"And for Webo. Now youre gonna either have to have someone on T one over. It sounds like you were saying Azel, I do think it has to be someone else because Killing Zay is when he is flash, he breaker on ie is going to be such an incredibly difficult task. But then look at what the rest of ti one is doing. No one is actually segmented themselves off from the rest. Theyre always working in tandem."
122,spk_0,30.885316666666665,31.046166666666668,"Exactly. You know, you win the 44 and you win the one B one. So as long as you have eyes on Weibo, you are chilling, you just make sure youre not getting poked out too heavily. Its gonna be like"
123,spk_2,31.057000000000002,31.39585,"Baker waiting over the wall, wants to land that charm to start this fight potentially, but no HBO just back away, not wanting to take a fight unless it is far more within their favor. And with more information and that is a very difficult thing to gather here in this game. You talk about saplings, things like that. All these opportunities. If you cant walk out of your base, they  do a whole lot of good
 does get very difficult."
124,spk_0,31.396016666666664,31.81951666666667,"The very least you can use that to clear out brushes to move forward, try to reclaim some vision as theyre going to do. Now knowing that ti one is on the reset, they will try to deny some of this vision, but the death cap is going to be here soon for Baker, you can see wits end gonna be pretty soon as well for Guma, these third items are gonna be coming through when the G A comes in for owner as well. Ti one are just trying to get as prepared as possible for the soul or for  this baron where they are really going to look to dominate and really
 nicely done."
125,spk_1,31.8197,32.26923333333333,"Shown by our observe here is how little we know. Well, obviously they have a suspicion that one is going to be somewhere in the jungle and they can scout with slings, but actually retaking control becomes incredibly difficult. And right now its still fun, but in 40 seconds, the Baron is coming up and we will be faced with one of two choices. I just try to hard force your way in and like flash engage with Weiwei onto someone of T one. But if they dont give you the opportunity, youre gonna have to try and fight up a straight fight.  And
 one of the biggest problems with that"
126,spk_0,32.26938333333333,32.556583333333336,"is when youre approaching Baron from blue side, you for a perfect carry, ultimate right? You know, you all try to flash in, try to go for that engage. If youre trying to follow up on Weiweis play, theres going to be a hostile takeover coming through your entire team. So the difficulty is extremely high for we from this position  also
 really difficult to lock down."
127,spk_2,32.55858333333334,32.77475,"Zeus is if he, if hes only trading with that unbound soul available. You see, Sha who comes down, that gives t one the idea that they are too invested towards that bottom side. That pressure from Zeus pretty clearly illustrated in that moment"
128,spk_1,32.79148333333333,33.086983333333336,"and look at the Adam spikes wits and done for Guma. No D kept for Faker G A for owner and on Webo site, two item and power spikes have been hit but dont know if thats gonna be enough. Shau though does have his surreal dust done. Maybe that can give them the Pope. They need to contest this baron, but it looks like it just isnt sticking."
129,spk_0,33.08715,33.219,"I mean, it feels like its just basically all of the shahu from this position. He needs to be able to hit shock glass on key members that cant deal them up, which is basically just Baker. Yeah."

135,spk_0,33.93091666666667,34.12576666666667,"I mean, he is just gonna kill that thing so fast. Theyre gonna start Baron at the same time. Theyre just gonna start it up. I think at this point, t one feels that they can do everything at once. And Weebo, youve got to make a stand. Now. Theres just no way from this position, you can give up a free Baron."
