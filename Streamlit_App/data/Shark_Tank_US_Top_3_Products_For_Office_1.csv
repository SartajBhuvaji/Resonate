1,spk_1,0.313,1.85925,"Hi, Sharks. Im Justin Beer from Bethesda Maryland. And today Im seeking $300,000 for 4% of my innovative apparel company collars and co 4% sharks. Welcome to business casual. 101. Lets begin. So, you know, this look, were you wearing a dress shirt under a sweater? Its pretty much the go to look for every single guy that works in an office around the world. I lived in New York for 12 years. This is whats called the midtown uniform. Problem is I hated wearing a long sleeved dress shirt under a sweater. It was always hot and uncomfortable and scratchy. I dont even have to spend the time buttoning up my shirt in the morning. And then sometimes you would also get whats called floppy collar where the color just flops down halfway through the day. But worst of all was putting him on a dress shirt under a sweater. It is so annoying. The sleeves always get bunched up my sleeves like right up there by my elbow sharks. I knew there had to be a better way, which is why I invented the dress collar. Polo. Its a stretchy comfortable golf shirt except the top has a firm collar on it. So it gives you that exact same look of a dress shirt, but its really just a comfortable polo sharks. Guys are wearing this with a tie under a blazer with a sweater and even just a slightly more elevated casual look with a Polo Sharks. We are helping guys look stylish and stay comfortable and weve created a new category of shirt. Help me create the next great worldwide brand. Thank you in front of you. We actually have four different color styles."
2,spk_2,1.89315,1.921666667,Its a nice stretchy material.
3,spk_1,1.926833333,2.006316667,"Yeah, its stretchy  ball. Totally
 breathable. Quite an interesting idea."
4,spk_3,2.01065,2.116833333,Did you say 4%? 4%? 4%? Ok. So sales so far
5,spk_1,2.127816667,2.370333333,"we started last year, weve sold so far 92,000 shirts for $5.4 million direct or direct to consumer all online. What was your profit margin on that? 20%? Net?"
6,spk_3,2.392316667,2.457483333," Wow, thats impressive.
 Yeah. So this is a really,"
7,spk_4,2.468,2.788983333,"really well made product. Thank you. Um But theres two things I hate, I hate with all my heart this look, Ive always hated that midtown look and its just not my style. I really hate that look. Another thing is I hate offers at 4% for 300,000. Im out."
8,spk_5,2.817833333,3.139333333,"That answer is that all right? Weve had other shirt companies on Shark Tank. However, of all the ones in 14 years, youve had the fastest growth to 5 million. I always consider that a hurdle. Getting to five. Thats a real business. So you must have some execution skills in this story  that others dont have. Youre
 right, Kevin, the, the secret is in our marketing."
9,spk_1,3.139483333,3.208983333,"Its in our funnel.  Weve mastered the funnel. Ive been doing this for 20 years.
 Doing what?"
10,spk_4,3.209166667,3.22315," For 20
 years?"
11,spk_1,3.233666667,3.3185,"Business, internet marketing. I had a business to be one of the first check in applications for events."
12,spk_2,3.31865,3.51715,"Let me jump in. I mean, while these are super nice, I think what youre doing is fantastic. I dont think its the right investment for me.  So I wish you good luck and I will purchase these gifts, but Im
 out. Thank you."
13,spk_1,3.517316667,3.5245,"Thank you,"
14,spk_3,3.53765,3.924833333,"Justin. Im quite shocked because Im in, Im in this business. I own a company called Localized and we basically take big brands global all over the world, this type of product specifically across Asia. Yeah, were seeing growth, but were not seeing it at the stage that youve just taken this business to.  What does it cost to make cost
 to make landed $15? We sell it anywhere from 65 to 75."
15,spk_5,3.925,4.227983333,"Ok. Ive never bid at a shirt deal because it Oh sure its such a total commodity. But you have numbers to justify. First time in 14 years, Im gonna make an offer to a shirt deal. I look at it and say 300,004% doesnt even get me out of bed to put a shirt on in the first place. Ill do it for 10%. No,"
16,spk_1,4.250333333,4.44665,"Kevin. If it was, if this was an old line private equity deal, old slow growth cash flow. This is a f one of the fastest growing D DC brands in the country. Were going at 28% a month"
17,spk_4,4.455833333,4.521,"when you, when you want that wall.  All
 the reason Im making the offer, do you have other"
18,spk_3,4.522316667,4.536166667,"Justin, Justin?"
19,spk_1,4.537166667,4.56765,"I have no other just to make, Im just the only,"
20,spk_3,4.585816667,4.83465,"youve completely dismissed an offer that I thought was pretty good. What sort of equity are you talking about? Then you came in with 300,000 for 4% youve dismissed as if Mr Wonderful wasnt even in the room. Thats a"
21,spk_1,4.842833333,4.9345,"$3 million. This thing, I pushed it for 7.5 million. Its not worth 7.5 million. Its worth 20."
22,spk_5,4.942483333,5.03365,"What is this? What is your free? But  what is
 it? 20%? We made a"
23,spk_1,5.037816667,5.038983333,million.
24,spk_5,5.057333333,5.0705,What do you need
25,spk_1,5.078483333,5.1835,"inventory marketing? And we need to build a team.  If were gonna go to $50 million we need to have some key players in
 place."
26,spk_5,5.18365,5.254833333,"How are you gonna get the money for inventory? So are you looking to raise or are you looking to?  I need a
 line of credit."
27,spk_1,5.2695,5.512316667,"But the other thing that Im looking for is a mentor and somebody to help me grow this thing really to the next level.  This is, you know what
 Ill mentor you. Ill mentor you take the 10% offer the next the next great brand."
28,spk_3,5.5125,5.864166667,"I dont know whether you know this market as well as I do. This is beyond Bruton. And the reason why this, this is so brutal is because fashion shifts and moves at a literally rapid rate. And you are up here at the moment and you think youve got the dream ticket coming into Shark Tank. The reality is in 6 to 12 months. This could go out of fashion."
29,spk_4,5.872816667,5.894833333," Heres the reality, Peter
 Peter."
30,spk_1,5.896816667,5.927983333,I dont think its going out of fashion. Peter Peter.
31,spk_4,5.928166667,6.287666667,"Heres the reality, heres the reality. Were going into a recession. People arent buying shirts and they cant pay their mortgage. Then he starts bringing in more. He has a lot of skills. He starts bringing in more. You know, some things dont get sold. He doesnt have a second door like Burlington or any place to get rid of this. And now his inventory starts to chew into his profits and then he realizes, oh, wait a minute, I dont know as much as I thought"
32,spk_1,6.302166667,6.3495,"and styles  that when I
 got in the business."
33,spk_4,6.349666667,6.426666667,"When I got in the business, Levis is doing 18 billion. Theyre doing four. Now just  everything goes out of
 Justin,"
34,spk_3,6.428666667,6.698166667,"Justin, Im about to make you an offer you need to cut out cost. I have that infrastructure and I could take this product and sell it all over the world. So Im going to make you an offer. But my offer is also at 10% for $300,000."
35,spk_5,6.714983333,6.79515,You must just do that
36,spk_1,6.814316667,6.85865," $3 million valuation.
 You were gonna go from four to what? Five,"
37,spk_5,6.863483333,7.011666667,"Justin. Well, why did you just go down to two? Hes out Justin. So look, $300,000 is obviously not enough. So you already have in mind where youre going to go get your additional capital."
38,spk_1,7.03165,7.0875," We need, we need probably a $700,000 line of credit. Thats
 easy."
39,spk_5,7.087666667,7.3695,"So if I went in with Peter, so Peter, so if you had a global domestic and I dont mind putting up and Im sure Peter wont either. Um, a line of credit at 89, whatever the interest rate should be. 89. Yeah, because rates are going up for a lot of credit  negotiator. You are for a line of
 credit"
40,spk_1,7.373316667,7.502833333,"mark. Well, we have inventory, we have assets, hard assets. I know you guys give out a line of credits to like apps and stuff. Theres nothing tangible. We assets. If you got it"
41,spk_2,7.5125,7.6085,"when he said me and Peter together, which they both have, you make  an offer,
 you"
42,spk_5,7.628833333,7.629333333,make
43,spk_4,7.6495,7.705983333,"your time here, everything they say to you. So"
44,spk_1,7.71865,7.798,"you see that you get a chance to,  were
 seeing that and were seeing that theres gonna be"
45,spk_4,7.798166667,7.85515,"10 more people through the door in another minute.  So what, whats your
 offer? So, Justin,"
46,spk_5,7.858,7.947816667,"Ill include the $700,000 line of credit, but 300,000 cash, what is the equity youre willing to offer us?"
47,spk_0,7.989316667,8.372316667,"Two sharks are out. Kevin and Peter have each offered $300,000 for 10% of Justins Shirt company collar and Co Mark is willing to go in with Peter and has offered an additional $700,000 line of credit, but he wants a bigger chunk of equity than the 4%. Justin came in offering and has asked him to make his best and final offer."
48,spk_5,8.38015,8.4125,What is the equity youre willing to offer us?
49,spk_1,8.443333333,8.583833333,5%? I think 10% is too much. I just think 10% when you say
50,spk_5,8.589666667,8.672,"that just let me clean something after you make your decision making easier, 10% is too much. Im out."
51,spk_1,8.689,8.697166667,"Ok. Yeah,"
52,spk_3,8.736666667,8.829816667,"Justin, I know the value of this business and youve done really well to get a 10% offer."
53,spk_1,8.84365,8.935983333,"So youre saying its worth 0.5. 1st of all, were gonna do 10 million in sales this year"
54,spk_3,8.9585,9.66675,"is just the problem is this is why in a partner, but youve got to have, you have two ears for a reason, right? And I dont think youre listening and thats not good. Thats not a good sign from an entrepreneur. You do have to listen. You can dismiss it and you can walk out of here. Thats absolutely fine. But we should be allowed to voice our opinion and youre not allowing me to voice mine because you keep talking over me, which lets me know that youre not listening. You have everything right now in the palm of your hand and for 6% thats all that were talking about. 6%. Have, you have no idea what the scale of the opportunity is and what were gonna add and the value to that  youre discounting
 it."
55,spk_1,9.666916667,9.746083333,"No, Im not discounting what you guys can bring and thats why Im here, but were gonna do 10 million instead. If you"
56,spk_3,9.749733333,9.765233333,"take it  with the
 two"
57,spk_2,9.768083333,9.817233333,"of them, you could actually be doing 80 million."
58,spk_4,9.825166667,9.9035,So youre talking to guys whove been in the business 30 years. We see deals like this all day long.
59,spk_5,9.913483333,10.245,"Neither one of us dont do this deal. Our lives are not gonna change. Were still gonna be rich. Justin, youre asking us to go to work for you. There is no amount you could pay to hire the two of us to mentor you and help you him globally. I couldnt even hire him  if youre valuing your company at 20 million and
 10, you"
60,spk_1,10.24865,10.27016667,"give you a discount of three,"
61,spk_3,10.29231667,10.347,"Justin, Justin. I have  a
 feeling youre not going to get a deal."
62,spk_5,10.35698333,10.373,"Im Justin,"
63,spk_1,10.4335,10.4605,"would you do it for seven? No,"
64,spk_4,10.48583333,10.51415," I think were all out. Right.
 Were all out."
65,spk_3,10.52916667,10.64681667,"7%. Were out Justin, I hate to say it, but Ive got a feeling that one day youre gonna regret this moment."
66,spk_5,10.73081667,10.97966667,"He still has a chance to say yes. So here it is $300,000 in equity for 10%. Ill put up a line of credit of $700,000. Well do a market rate of interest. Right. But its first dollar in meaning I get paid the minute you get paid by your customer"
67,spk_1,11.01648333,11.02998333,and youre in it
68,spk_3,11.03683333,11.04748333,and Im in it.
69,spk_1,11.06731667,11.18215,Yes or no. Lets do it. Here we go.
70,spk_2,11.20398333,11.20983333,Good
71,spk_3,11.21548333,11.24633333,"job.  You lucky.
 Wow."
72,spk_6,11.24916667,11.26948333," Its gonna be the best deal. You ever
 did?"
73,spk_5,11.27765,11.3265,"Congrats, man. Youve done an amazing deal. Thanks. Uh huh."
74,spk_3,11.32981667,11.36631667,Well done for no walking away.
75,spk_4,11.36865,11.48683333,"I knew there was a reason I didnt like guys that wore this shirt, but congratulations.  No. Congratulations. Im glad you were able to start listening. Thank you
 so much."
76,spk_1,11.48698333,11.49748333,This was great.
77,spk_5,11.53383333,11.68931667,"Mm. He reminded me of me. Im not gonna lie because when youre young you dont know what you dont know. I did a lot more talking than listening.  Its
 gonna be interesting to see how he works with us though."
78,spk_3,11.69148333,11.70381667,Well find out
79,spk_1,11.71783333,11.97433333,"it means a ton that Mark Cuban and Peter Jones are mentors now. I mean, having them in my corner is just going to kind of free me up to, to think bigger than I ever thought before. And, uh, hopefully one day Ill be sitting next to them in one of the shark chairs"
