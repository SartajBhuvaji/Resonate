1,spk_6,22.28281667,23.36865,"Hi, Sharks. My name is Bing Howenstine and Im the CEO of all 33. Im here today to ask for $500,000 for a 2.5%. Hello. Piece of our company. Bing baby. I know it is a very serious ask, but thats because it is for a very serious problem. Chairs. They may be killing you. Now, youve all heard sitting is the new smoking. Well, they are right. Sitting for any length of period of time is really bad for you and chairs. Well, theyve had the same basic design for almost 3000 years, whatever youre sitting in. Even the fancy expensive chairs you guys are sitting in right now, you can find yourself locked, stuck, immobile and a lot of times in pain and for all of us working at home these days, this is just not ok. Well, I have some really good news for you. Oh, all 33 is here to save the day, but dont just take it from me. Lets hear what one of our biggest fans has to say."
2,spk_8,23.41648333,23.77083333,"Hey, Sharks, Im Justin Bieber and this is the all 33. Its the chair that moves like I do. I mean, guys, look at this perfect posture, got my chest up my shoulder back. Im waiting for you? I mean, have you guys ever seen a chair that could do this? Im doing a full ab workout right now. All right. Hit me up later. Ill be back if you gotta sit. This is it"
3,spk_6,23.80716667,24.35266667,"now, Justin knows what hes talking about because this is our patented sit in motion technology. Its like a chair within a chair and it rocks just like our sales about. You dont have to have moves like Justin in order for this chair to work for you because all you have to do is sit, get fit and all 33 of your vertebrae. Well, theyre gonna keep moving all day now. This is a chair now, Mr Wonderful. Youre looking particularly uncomfortable. I am.  Would you like to come up and see
 what were talking about?"
4,spk_5,24.35283333,24.42333333," I have a bad back from a squash injury. Oh,
 well, then lets see what happens."
5,spk_6,24.42831667,24.58948333,"Make sure you get your behind all the way into the back of the chair. Scooch back there. All right.  And you can probably feel the rocking motion move back and forth. Very
 interesting."
6,spk_5,24.60181667,24.64616667,Why is this making me sit up straight? Why is that happening?
7,spk_6,24.65131667,25.08448333,"So, the, the patterns that we have about this are really quite unique. Basically, Doctor Dennis Colonel who invented this. Hes been doing this for a long, long time. Hes got 45 years of treating backs necks and everything else he figured out. Lets get your hips moving almost as if what youre experiencing is, is, is a sensation thats almost like youre standing. But when youre sitting, it is moving all 33 of your vertebrae while youre sitting. And theres nothing else in the world that is doing."
8,spk_5,25.08465,25.34331667,"Im very skeptical about all these claims on chairs because Ive tried so many and I also have tried different devices that way back. This thing actually is working. I dont care about Bieber. Im gonna kick his ass when an eye album comes out.  I dont like your valuation though. Well, we can
 talk about that."
9,spk_6,25.34481667,25.36666667," I would expect that from
 you."
10,spk_4,25.36883333,25.4125,"Tell us how, how did you get into this and what happened?"
11,spk_6,25.41266667,25.90833333,"So I have been a patient of Doctor Colonels for about 20 years and then friend, Im also a bit of a serial entrepreneur. I got into making products and getting products sold along the way. I got into the back hair space when I sat on Denniss chair, an early prototype. I said this is a whole different ball game, but I knew that Dennis was never gonna get this thing going as a friend. I said, let me help you. Im gonna do a Kickstarter for you. So we did that.  It performed very well. Whats very well? We did $800,000.
 Thats very"
12,spk_4,25.90948333,26.02898333,"great. Did you license it from him? No partners with him. I own a small piece of it.  How much of the company do you
 own? I own about 5%."
13,spk_7,26.03183333,26.176,"So a premium chair in todays market sells for roughly $2000. A real premium chair.  What does this sell for?
 Were selling this for 799."
14,spk_5,26.178,26.2405," Whats your margin? Whats it cost you to make?
 So, our margins about 67%."
15,spk_6,26.248,26.332," Uh our cost delivered to a customer with all that good stuff is about 260
 bucks. 2.5%."
16,spk_5,26.33216667,26.415,"500,020 million valuation. Yep. How many chairs are you selling? How many dollars?"
17,spk_6,26.41516667,26.4925," So, this year alone, weve sold about 3.2 million. Were on track to hit 5.5.
 Ok."
18,spk_5,26.49266667,26.52615," And what are you gonna make on five and a
 half?"
19,spk_6,26.52648333,26.63333333,"So we were, uh, uh, slightly profitable in the second quarter and we expect be the same in this uh,  third
 quarter."
20,spk_5,26.6335,26.98216667,"I mean, just help me because, you know, Im, Im a quick study in, in most sectors, um, office supply furniture or even if you wanna call this high end chair design, whatever, maybe it would trade for 11 times pre tax cash flow. I mean, Im not saying it isnt a great chair but its a chair.  Why is it worth 20 million
 dollars?"
21,spk_6,26.98366667,27.22733333,"We are looking at comps for other companies that are out there in a very similar space that are 3 to 4 times revenue. We know were gonna get there. We have also talked to the market, not my opinion, 20 million bucks is a pretty good valuation. So then why are you here?"
22,spk_4,27.22916667,27.28566667,"Why am I here? If you talked to so many people that gave you that valuation, why are you here?"
23,spk_6,27.29298333,27.32733333,Because shark money is better than other money?
24,spk_4,27.3275,27.39183333,"So youre charging us more than no sales because with sharks,"
25,spk_6,27.392,27.52665,"Im prepared to give you a discount because you guys are sharks and you give a discount. Im the CEO of the company and Im here to make a deal.  Youre
 a marketing company, first and foremost, youve got,"
26,spk_5,27.52681667,27.78081667,"youve got your product, right? Its got its angle, its got its differentiation and thats good. Right? I just dont wanna be in the chair business. Sure. You know, its just of all the businesses big and small, not that theres anything wrong with the chair business, but its just not for me. Um So for those reasons, Im out."
27,spk_6,27.79033333,27.80815,Thats fair. Thank you.
28,spk_7,27.81781667,28.11466667,"If you had come in here today and you wanted to sell me a chair, youre the perfect guy, but you werent here to sell a chair. You were here to sell a business, correct? You said you were a 5% owner, correct? I for some reason feel it lacks credibility. Ok? I think thats a good lesson for other entrepreneurs. You cant send a salesman here."
29,spk_6,28.11848333,28.569,"Well, with all due respect, this is my life right now. And to, you know, its a bit of a denigration to call me a simple salesman on this deal.  Barbaras very
 good at pissing everybody off. Thats fair. You can do that. But the fact is thats not, is that is not what is happening here. Im here to build a company. We are building a movement in a category that hasnt been done before. Were going up against the big guys that, you know, frankly, its a fractured system that I look forward to breaking."
30,spk_7,28.56966667,28.75883333,"I wish I could believe that youre building a category, but I dont see that as a category. I see it as a chair with a new design element, but it doesnt get me all excited. So for that reason,"
31,spk_6,28.78366667,28.79331667,thank you.
32,spk_2,28.80416667,29.40883333,"The problem for me is whenever somebody comes in and they have something different that can really be good, but theyre just starting and they wanna get a shark. I always feel the smart thing to do is to be a lot smarter about your valuation because if you get somebody in and alongside with you, you could take a one off item like this and blow it up, which is what Im good at. So if you had had something that was just more realistic because youre, I, I just feel its so out of whack for me, it just turns me off. And for that reason, unfortunately, Im out"
33,spk_6,29.42281667,29.578,"thats fair. There is a competitor company that just had a $200 million valuation on, you know, just  a little higher
 sales. I actually, I actually work with one of the bigger guys, uh,"
34,spk_4,29.58731667,29.8425,"very desk and the whole, uh, theory is the desk raise up and the chairs that, you know, they sell are a little pole, a chair. So you have to balance yourself. Right. Um, this would be a conflict, uh, with me. So Im out,"
35,spk_5,29.88966667,30.0445,"I started choking on the valuation and Im still choking on it. I tried the chair and it has merit but 500 K for 2.5%.  I dont get out of bed for 2.5
 percent."
36,spk_6,30.05148333,30.11231667,"Well, I cant do it. Im happy to have you in a higher place in the cap table."
37,spk_5,30.12665,30.22848333,"Just squeeze your head like a teenage pimple and I feel like doing that, but I dont want to. So Im out."
38,spk_6,30.24433333,30.35348333,"Ok. Thank you very much. I will buy one though. Well, uh youre gonna have to pay full price this time, I guess I will."
39,spk_5,30.38583333,30.41365,"All right. Thank you, Bing"
40,spk_6,30.44781667,30.64016667,"to have Barbara. Just call me a salesman. I think that was a bit offensive and, you know, I dont think any entrepreneur wants to hear that when you put your blood sweat and tears into something. Um, I, I find that uh particularly, you know, not cool."
