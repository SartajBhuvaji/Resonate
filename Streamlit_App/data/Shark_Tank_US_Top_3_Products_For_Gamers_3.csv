Theres a weight loss machine as well. Is that what youre thinking? Absolutely. But theres a bigger issue, right? This is pretty much based around Oculus Rift, right? As Oculus Rift goes, you guys go, can you tell me what that is Oculus Rift? Thats the headset. The rift is basically what started this virtual reality revolution. Theyve done a phenomenal job of allowing you to put on a headset and be in an immersive world. Is that included in the price? Its not included in the price for that $300. Is the gun included? The gun is off the shelf, you can buy it online. It sounds like its gonna be an 8 to $900 cost, which is quite a bit. Why dont you tell us why youre worth $20 million today? I mean, no ones addressed that. I think its the elephant in the room. Thats a ridiculous valuation for this. Let me walk you through the numbers. The rift is an analog for our product. Same target market, same people. Theyre selling 200 of these per day right now. Their projects to do 500,000 units in sales next year. If we convert one out of 20 buyers of the rift, well, we will be selling 25,000 units next year, which is $12.5 million sales. Theres a fundamental difference though, when I buy the headgear, I can still sit around and lounge. Youre forcing me to stand and youre forcing me to be interactive. I dont think people want to be that interactive. I sold three times on the number just without a product. We can debate the merits of the product. Im just trying to look at the sheer number. You want me to pay your value two years from now. Today, heres my thinking on it. If my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately. I think its a problem because of its size in the home. I also think its a tremendous problem to sell this in retail. I sell a lot of product now through retail, I couldnt get anybody to give the floor space to this. Youd pay so much just to demonstrate it. But I think thats a concern. You have to realize that 50% of the population is married and theyre gonna have to deal with their wife on this one. So Im out,"
1,spk_3,24.77065,25.03583333,"you know, I see the market, you know, Black Ops did amazing Grand Theft Auto. Right. Breaking records. I, I see the market but I also dont see somebody playing this more than an hour or half an hour a day before. They cant even play anymore because theyre out of breath or theyre tired, they just wont revisit it. So for all those reasons and more, Im out,"
2,spk_0,25.067,27.13115,"look great product. I will definitely buy one. But I think Im an anomaly. You better talk to your wife. Shes not a pushover. Well, we have a big house barber. Shell never see it. But I dont think that people want to exercise and immerse themselves in the fiscal world to that degree. I think if people really want to immerse themselves that way, I think theyll go outside. I, I dont buy the premise. Im out. I see you going with it, but it is a sub segment of a subsegment market and its very expensive. I look at it and say to myself, is this a good deal of $20 million where you are right now? And the answer is no, its not. Theres too much risk between your delivery of a consumer product, a retail distribution strategy and your sales, youve got tons of risk, all kinds of risk. And I gotta pay tomorrows price today. I hate deals like that. I hate it when you make me pay for two years from now. If everything works today, why would I do that? Im not an idiot. Why would I do that because of the potential youre going to have problems. T, is gonna happen. My friend and I have to pay for that now. No, its an outrage ridiculous. Im out. I get what youre doing. I could see you creating 20 million in sales, 25 million in sales with this. But youre competing just like headsets are gonna be competing just like the um consoles are gonna be competing. Youre one more, one more outlet competing for consumer dollars, you have to push that ball so hard to keep going. If you havent told me that theres a way to get to 50 million in sales and in six years, theres gonna be completely new technology that blows all this away for those reasons. Im out. Thank you. Thanks guys. You know, I look at the experience and what can people learn from what happened here today? And for me, the lesson is very interesting. Ip, way overpriced. If you had put this at a 5 million valuation, it would have been very interesting. Good luck. Thank you, John. Anybody who pays 20 million for that. Is insane. Gamers are lazy. Like most human beings, they dont want to exercise, they dont."
