1,spk_0,12.81848333,12.94531667,"thats a good looking dude. There you go, Marlo. Be really easy on him.  Hes a wonderful guy. One punch Cuban where
 lights up you hit."
2,spk_3,12.95216667,13.33931667,"Look at him, Im just gonna uh Mr Wonderful. Youre in trouble. I gotta tell you. Look at that. Awesome. Ready to go, Mark. But you can see Mark was 36% accurate. He was hitting real hard but not necessarily real accurate.  I didnt
 feel a thing."
3,spk_2,13.37381667,13.39483333," Mark. Was it
 fun?"
4,spk_0,13.40566667,13.61716667,"I mean, it was a nice little workout. How long do we do? You did 15 seconds? I mean, doing three minutes on that would be a great workout. Terry eventually. We got to get to this. We put a huge valuation in this company $20 million. Do you have any sales?"
5,spk_3,13.61731667,14.06015,"Uh we do, we are uh sales to date are a little over $4 million. Wow, 4.2 million. Thats over about 18 months. Do you make any money? We are not profitable yet. We should be profitable in September of this year. And is this designed for gyms and the home? Absolutely. The black model is the personal model. The silver model is the commercial model. Where are the sales? Give me the breakdown currently? About 70% commercial and about 30% home."
6,spk_2,14.06548333,14.11648333,I think its very cool. I do really like it.
7,spk_3,14.11816667,14.20133333,"You get demonstration,  I think better than almost anyone in the world having your experience while
 youre"
8,spk_0,14.20533333,14.27865,"up to Laurie. Lets go back to the numbers.  Whats your cost to make one
 of those units?"
9,spk_3,14.27881667,14.42698333,"Uh just under $2000 for the commercial units? Well, Terry,  this is
 really a digital punching bag punching bag costs about $1200 a good one,"
10,spk_0,14.42716667,14.50281667,"leather, et cetera.  What does that
 cost? Uh The commercial unit is $7000."
11,spk_3,14.51548333,14.57281667,"Who it is? Thats very, thats  you can buy a car
 or"
12,spk_0,14.57481667,14.58866667," buy
 this"
13,spk_3,14.62581667,15.63783333,"or you can buy a uh buy a treadmill or an elliptical in the same price range. What about the home unit? How much is that, Terry? Uh 2995. How did you sell them? We sell, we promote it on TV, with direct to consumer advertising. We sell electronically. Weve been running infomercials. Uh, weve run one in two minute spots. Not the long form. How are those doing? Uh, they did very well. We ran them last year. Weve spent about a million dollars in TV. Last year, uh, generated about a million and a half dollars in sales that brings up something else. How much in debt are you? Uh We have on our balance sheet about uh $7.5 million a shareholder. I knew I was gonna get to that one. Terry, Terry, how much of that is your own money? Uh A small portion of that is mine and my familys money and that means that now were gonna find out you own very little of this company, correct? Um I uh own about 35% of the company."
14,spk_0,15.66531667,15.91098333,"You know, Im a nice guy, so I wouldnt do this to you. But if I were an opportunistic guy, I would just simply wait for that debt to come due and then Id own your company. Basically, thats what those debtors are gonna do.  If you dont figure out a way to pay them, theyll own all the equity when this is
 over."
15,spk_3,15.93483333,16.07248333,"Um We dont believe thats gonna happen given where we are in run rate by the time that debt is due, our cash flow will allow us to repay that debt.  But, you
 know,"
16,spk_0,16.07516667,16.41848333,"in life and in business. Pooh, pooh happens. Dont you think a savvy financial investor in which Im gonna include myself right now would want to see that resolved before I put a dime into this company. Because if I buy your equity at this valuation of $20 million and the dead guys arent happy.  Im screwed,
 Terry."
17,spk_3,16.4605,16.89448333,"We will be uh repaying that and addressing the happens if you dont, well, well have to deal with those creditors at that time. How many investors do you have? We have about 60 investors. 60  have your investors
 seen any money back yet? Oh, hell no, no. This is a story about a lot of debt,  great product.
 Too much debt. Im out."
18,spk_0,16.91631667,17.182,"Thank you. I have gone to the future in a split second and heres what happened. The debt wasnt paid back and those shareholders wiped you out. You are now an employee of the company with no equity at all. The smartest guys on the balance sheet are always the debt guys.  They know your
 future already."
19,spk_3,17.19098333,17.2775,"Luckily those guys are also my common stock and convertible to venture partner,  but theyre gonna
 own all"
20,spk_0,17.29065,17.56365,that doesnt matter. Theyre gonna force you into bankruptcy and anything that you own is going to be gone. Any assets that you had are going to be sold and theyre gonna take their pennies on the dollar. Theyre not your friend. Good luck to you. But I have a feeling when we meet you again. Youre gonna be an employee. Thats it.
21,spk_3,17.5945,17.96733333,"Im out. You know, Id love to, uh, be before you today with less debt. Unfortunately, the markets told us how we could raise money to deliver it. Were standing before you with two products with a $20 million valuation, which is a fraction of companies like total gym like Nordic Trek, like Bowflex. These are billion dollar market cap, not anything"
22,spk_0,17.96916667,18.31448333,"like them at all. Those are very simple devices. How you even spent $7.5 million to develop? This is beyond me and the valuation. Normally, Im the one who doesnt care about valuation because you can always grow past it. If youve learned from the wise one, I wouldnt call you the wise one, but its just crazy for that reason. Im out."
23,spk_3,18.33616667,18.67248333,"Ok. You know, youre like in the third round with a young Mike Tyson. Hes giving you two body blows, but hes about to cock back and crack your head to the white meat. Dead is dangerous. Im out and then there was one"
24,spk_2,18.709,19.03081667,"I like it. I think it looks like a lot of fun. Great way to have a workout. I think that its a great product. You are in serious debt, but I think youll get out of it, but I dont like to get into that type of situation. And for that reason, Im out."
25,spk_3,19.067,19.24233333,"Thank you, Laurie.  Thank you, Sherlock, Eric. Thanks very much.
 All the best. I didnt know if he was gonna get out. Laurie. His mouthpiece is in the third row by now."
26,spk_0,19.24481667,19.26916667," Its one of those slow
 motion"
27,spk_3,19.32431667,19.52583333,while I appreciate what the Sharks said. I have no doubt that Nexor and our team will be successful. We will overcome these low balance sheet issues and continue to grow to a profitable worldwide company
