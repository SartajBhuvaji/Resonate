00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.039
Let's go ahead and get to the major news here in Washington.

1
00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.670
The border bill arrived and seemingly died

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.030
upon arrival.

3
00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.670
It was negotiated by Senator James Lankford,

4
00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.729
Senator Kirsten Cinema and some uh Senator Chris

5
00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:15.109
Murphy as well from the Democratic side,

6
00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.629
uh Kristen Cinema, I guess from the independent side.

7
00:00:17.639 --> 00:00:20.139
So we call it that crystal. And then we have uh Senator

8
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.579
Langford being from the State of Oklahoma.

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.469
So Senator Langford appeared on Fox and Friends

10
00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:28.979
yesterday morning to make his case for the bill

11
00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.860
and to rebut some of his GOP colleagues

12
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.959
who preemptively were rejecting some of the details.

13
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.200
Here's what he had to say.

14
00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:37.400
He said no self respecting senators should agree to

15
00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.979
vote on the 370 page bill this week.

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.799
Any 41 senators can prevent the bill from proceeding

17
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.060
if you agree that senators should have this bill

18
00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.130
for at least a few weeks and certainly more than a few days before voting on it.

19
00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:50.310
Say so,

20
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.330
uh you understand where he's coming from, right?

21
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.409
Don't you guys have a procedural vote this week?

22
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:56.259
Are you going to vote on the bill by the end of the week?

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.860
So we actually had this bill came out yesterday Sunday.

24
00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.889
Uh,

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.930
the first procedural vote is Wednesday and that procedural vote is literally just

26
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.360
open it up to be able to go through it and to be able to say,

27
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.190
are we going to debate it this week?

28
00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:10.919
That's what Senator Lee is actually talking about. It's interesting

29
00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:12.620
that he said he's already opposed to it.

30
00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:15.379
He needs three weeks to be able to read it, but he's already opposed to it.

31
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:18.800
Uh So, uh again, people have got to be able to read it, go through it themselves.

32
00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:20.819
Don't just go off a Facebook post somewhere.

33
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.059
What the bill says, this dramatically changes asylum and dram

34
00:01:24.194 --> 00:01:27.753
radical changes, deportations. We no longer have a 10 year backlog.

35
00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:28.893
It builds more wall.

36
00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:31.814
Those are the key things that it actually does, but read it for yourselves.

37
00:01:31.823 --> 00:01:33.134
Don't just believe what's online,

38
00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:35.753
read it for yourselves and uh many Republicans

39
00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:37.734
did and still have ended up rejecting it.

40
00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:42.424
We will get to that. But uh there's actually a good summary of this deal from Bill Milu

41
00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:44.573
and some of you guys may be familiar with him.

42
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:46.933
He's the Fox news reporter who covers the border.

43
00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:50.473
He's very critical of the immigration situation of Biden.

44
00:01:50.484 --> 00:01:52.097
So I think, you know, his overall summary,

45
00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:55.568
I think you could take uh from the most skeptical point of view.

46
00:01:55.578 --> 00:01:58.828
We can go ahead and put this up there on the screen and I'll read from some of it.

47
00:01:58.837 --> 00:02:02.148
So he says, quote, knew my initial highlights from the border deal.

48
00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:06.297
There's no amnesty and legalization of anyone already who is in the US illegally.

49
00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:10.426
It funds an increase for ice detention capacity from 50,000.

50
00:02:10.437 --> 00:02:11.957
From the current 34,000.

51
00:02:12.128 --> 00:02:14.388
There's a seven day, this is the most controversial part.

52
00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:17.477
So please pay attention to this at a seven day rolling average

53
00:02:17.488 --> 00:02:22.242
of 5000 encounters per day or 8500 encounters in a single day.

54
00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:25.011
The Department of Homeland Security quote would be required to

55
00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.891
shut the border down and turn away anyone who crosses

56
00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:30.361
no new asylum claims would be allowed.

57
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:33.992
Anyone crossing would be removed, it would end the idea of quote,

58
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.332
I made it to us soil and you have to process me that would be

59
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.912
over border patrol would not process an illegal crosser and they would be removed.

60
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:45.082
No asylum claim permitted unless it was made at a port of entry.

61
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:47.035
Pay, pay attention to that because it's important

62
00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.975
they can go on and they say this does not mean that quote, for quote,

63
00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:54.966
5000 are allowed in before the authority kicks in single adults would be detained.

64
00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.555
Families would be released by alternative to detention.

65
00:02:57.645 --> 00:02:59.856
Asylum cases would be fast tracked to months rather

66
00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:02.095
than years under a new rapid expanded system.

67
00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:04.526
Those who fail would be quickly removed from the US.

68
00:03:04.636 --> 00:03:06.705
The initial pass would be reviewed from work

69
00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:09.766
authorization claims and 90 day supervision until final,

70
00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:12.076
final asylum claim is determined

71
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.949
shutdown. Authority doesn't drop until the crossings decrease significantly

72
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.619
in the days.

73
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.289
Following that significantly,

74
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.869
there are tougher asylum requirements and highly credible

75
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.100
fear standard including the three bars to eligibility,

76
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.289
criminal history.

77
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.210
Could they have resettled in another country on the

78
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.130
way to the US called a safe third country?

79
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.570
And quote, could they have resettled somewhere else in their own country?

80
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.669
Just saying that you're scared to return home no longer is enough to.

81
00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:37.772
In the initial interview,

82
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.561
it appears that that legislation would then

83
00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:42.472
move asylum claim decisions away from immigration judges

84
00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:46.341
and have them be handled by US cis which is the US immigration

85
00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:47.582
system. Next.

86
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.281
They talk here about some of the increases

87
00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:51.861
to fema humanitarian aid uh increase in the

88
00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:56.341
number of new visas that will be granted over the last five years to 50,000 funding.

89
00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:57.621
And this is another important part.

90
00:03:57.632 --> 00:04:02.093
I want to pay attention to funding to hire hundreds or ice deportation officers,

91
00:04:02.164 --> 00:04:05.673
border patrol agents and US cis asylum officers.

92
00:04:05.684 --> 00:04:08.464
It says no unaccompanied minor could be removed and some of

93
00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:11.794
these minors would receive attorneys pro bono and are taxpayer funded.

94
00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:16.243
DH S would take 90 days to have this new system before it goes into place.

95
00:04:16.283 --> 00:04:19.283
And the context that he adds at the end is that the border has seen at

96
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:21.303
least 5000 encounters almost every single day of

97
00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:23.063
the last couple of years under Biden.

98
00:04:23.074 --> 00:04:23.954
So if the bill were signed

99
00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:28.006
law, the border would likely be shut down on the first day that it takes effect.

100
00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:31.235
So crystal, with all of that and with that skeptical summary,

101
00:04:31.246 --> 00:04:33.645
I think here by the Fox News reporter,

102
00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:38.656
it does seem to still mean that almost all Republicans have rejected it out of hand.

103
00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:40.395
The House of Representatives say it's a nonstarter

104
00:04:40.406 --> 00:04:41.506
-- and then it's not going
-- to happen.

105
00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:43.675
Yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty clear there.

106
00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:47.885
This is a bill that is very, you know, pretty far in the restrictionist direction.

107
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.059
Um It is not something that Democrats ever would have agreed to

108
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.089
under Donald Trump or would agree to next time under Donald Trump.

109
00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:54.929
Historically,

110
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.010
any sort of increased enforcement mechanisms have been tied in a quote

111
00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:02.690
unquote comprehensive immigration bill with some sort of path to legalization.

112
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.670
There is absolutely none of that there.

113
00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.220
Um There's a real, so I,

114
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.660
I do wanna say there are pieces of this bill

115
00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.394
that I would actually support including as we've discussed.

116
00:05:11.404 --> 00:05:11.755
I mean,

117
00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:13.095
one of the biggest problems is you have

118
00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:16.975
this massive asylum case backlog millions of cases.

119
00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:20.535
So it takes years for these cases to be adjudicated.

120
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:21.035
You know,

121
00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:24.424
there are provisions in here that would help to expedite that and also would

122
00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:27.904
flood the zone with resources to help uh get rid of that backlog.

123
00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:29.154
I think that part is important,

124
00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.980
but there's also a sort of direct attack on asylum

125
00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:34.679
itself making it much more difficult to claim asylum.

126
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.230
It's already extremely difficult to be granted asylum.

127
00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:40.019
The bar is already extremely high.

128
00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:43.350
And then there's also as we discussed before this, uh, quote unquote,

129
00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:47.100
shut down the border, which is a little bit misleading how this is labeled.

130
00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:52.299
But basically, the idea is once you get to over 5000 on average, on a daily basis,

131
00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:55.087
there are some provisions in there like the president could change that authority,

132
00:05:55.096 --> 00:05:56.467
which is the other piece is like

133
00:05:56.717 --> 00:05:58.807
you are giving the president whether it's Biden

134
00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:02.127
or Trump massive new powers under this bill.

135
00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:04.696
But the idea is once you get to that 5000,

136
00:06:04.707 --> 00:06:09.397
you basically sort of like end due process and say, screw it to asylum whatsoever.

137
00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:12.277
So let me just talk about the politics because in some ways,

138
00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:14.986
what's in the bill isn't all that important given that

139
00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:15.277
it

140
00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:17.664
have a chance in hell of passing.

141
00:06:17.854 --> 00:06:21.683
Um You know, the politics here are that Trump basically came out and said,

142
00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:25.914
I don't want you guys to support this bill and the Republican Party was like, ok,

143
00:06:25.924 --> 00:06:26.584
we won't.

144
00:06:26.783 --> 00:06:31.394
And so someone like James Langford who, um you know, took at face value,

145
00:06:31.403 --> 00:06:33.843
the idea that the Republicans actually wanted a

146
00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:38.194
deal that combined border funding with Ukraine funding

147
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.360
is real funding,

148
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:42.640
which was what Republicans were pushing for at the beginning of this process.

149
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:44.121
Someone like him who, you know,

150
00:06:44.131 --> 00:06:45.730
really tried to negotiate in good faith and

151
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.550
really tried to give Republicans the like,

152
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:49.740
restrictionist ideas that he wanted under

153
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:51.680
the context of a democratic administration.

154
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.610
He's left holding the bag like, hey guys, I thought this is what y'all wanted.

155
00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:58.640
But you know, the politics at the end of the day rules the day,

156
00:06:58.651 --> 00:07:01.321
one more thing on the politics because I think this is important.

157
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.709
There is a lot of democratic glee about, oh Biden, he's so clever, like,

158
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.980
look at how he called their bluff and now he's

159
00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:14.140
flipped the script on immigration and now Republicans are,

160
00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:14.390
you know,

161
00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.920
look bad on this and it's they're exposed as

162
00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:18.640
not really wanting to be serious about this problem.

163
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.929
I don't buy that analysis at

164
00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:21.640
all.

165
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.910
I do not buy that analysis at all.

166
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.170
Number one, the border, whatever is happening,

167
00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:29.890
there is still happening on your watch and you know, whatever I think of it,

168
00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:32.089
there are many Americans who find the chaos.

169
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.089
And I think that's fair that who want to see an

170
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.190
orderly border process and that does not exist right now.

171
00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:38.970
That is still going to be the case.

172
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.260
It is still going to be under a Biden administration. And so that's a problem.

173
00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:43.010
Number two,

174
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.250
you know, in the last election,

175
00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:47.179
Biden versus Trump,

176
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.790
we had that prior to that election,

177
00:07:49.799 --> 00:07:51.549
we had the whole child separation policy

178
00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:53.549
which Americans were genuinely horrified by.

179
00:07:53.559 --> 00:07:54.329
I mean, it was terrible,

180
00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:57.799
these kids who were orphaned by the United States government,

181
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.779
you know, the audio that was leaked of the border patrol agents mocking them.

182
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.750
And um all of that was horrifying

183
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.380
and Biden in part to win a Democratic primary.

184
00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:10.200
He really positioned himself as being much

185
00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:13.140
more compassionate of having this uh inclusive

186
00:08:13.149 --> 00:08:16.480
message about immigration saying he would be a clean break from Donald Trump.

187
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.410
And that ended up being a winning message.

188
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.459
I mean, I'm not gonna say that was like the number one reason why he got elected,

189
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.500
but that was part of the appeal is it would be a

190
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.600
break from the cruelty and the chaos of a Donald Trump administration.

191
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.519
What Biden and the Democrats have effectively done here

192
00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:33.429
is just embraced all of the Republican arguments on immigration

193
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.000
just completely caved and effectively said like you're right

194
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.520
about immigration and your model is the right model.

195
00:08:38.609 --> 00:08:39.539
And guess what

196
00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.849
if you want a border hawk, you are not going to defeat Donald Trump on those grounds?

197
00:08:44.859 --> 00:08:48.880
Like why would you compete on who can be the biggest asshole at the border?

198
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.960
You are not going to win that competition?

199
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:57.359
So one of the basics of politics is to try to fight the fight that you want

200
00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:02.809
to fight on the grounds that you want to want to engage where your strengths are.

201
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.280
No,

202
00:09:03.289 --> 00:09:07.130
don't go to the place where he's the strongest where if it's a competition of

203
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.830
like who's going to be the most cruel and the most restriction is the border,

204
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.760
there's no doubt that Donald Trump and Stephen

205
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.099
Miller are gonna win that all day long.

206
00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:17.380
So I think all of this celebration. Oh Biden, so clever, Biden, so smart.

207
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.562
This was such a great ploy is insane. I think it's, I

208
00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:22.643
think it's ridiculous and I think it's foolish.

209
00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:25.413
I totally agree on the politics, disagree a bit on the policy.

210
00:09:25.422 --> 00:09:28.562
People can go watch some of our debates on that in the past.

211
00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:31.732
But yeah, I mean, listen, no matter what, like I, I'm a,

212
00:09:31.742 --> 00:09:33.963
I'm a pretty strong immigration voter.

213
00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.843
I would say it's one of the main,

214
00:09:35.853 --> 00:09:39.812
if anything still ties me to the main Republican party, it would be immigration.

215
00:09:39.903 --> 00:09:41.283
Why would I ever vote for Biden?

216
00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:43.502
It's like one of those where if this is a policy

217
00:09:43.513 --> 00:09:45.562
where it's one of my number one issues and I,

218
00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:49.632
why would I vote for somebody who uh consistently undermined the immigration

219
00:09:49.866 --> 00:09:51.806
over the first three years got dragged here,

220
00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:53.806
kicking and screaming and is trying to do this

221
00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.736
to, for a political ploy, which as you said, is not going to work.

222
00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:57.096
Now,

223
00:09:57.176 --> 00:10:01.245
I'll take myself out of it and just say who are people who are voting on the border?

224
00:10:01.255 --> 00:10:03.486
If you are voting on the border, you're a Republican.

225
00:10:03.495 --> 00:10:05.315
Like I, I just want to break it to you.

226
00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:06.366
You, you, you are,

227
00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:09.185
you are the number one issue in the Republican

228
00:10:09.195 --> 00:10:12.276
party today amongst the GOP primary electorate is immigration.

229
00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:15.236
Also something else that has become very clear on the politics here.

230
00:10:15.245 --> 00:10:18.846
I'm curious what you think of this is that in the past, excuse me,

231
00:10:19.179 --> 00:10:21.229
is that in the past is that there was

232
00:10:21.239 --> 00:10:23.419
a major split on immigration in the Republican Party,

233
00:10:23.429 --> 00:10:30.099
Lindsey Graham Marco Rubio, the gang of eight by and large embraced in 2013.

234
00:10:30.169 --> 00:10:34.239
Uh the idea of comprehensive immigration reform paired

235
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.729
with some future border enforcement now with the

236
00:10:36.739 --> 00:10:41.719
basically the shutdown and the collapse of GOP support for even a bill like this.

237
00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:43.159
It basically means Trump has

238
00:10:43.265 --> 00:10:46.085
won the argument within the party. Even in this.

239
00:10:46.096 --> 00:10:49.765
It is over the starting point for the Republican Party now is

240
00:10:49.776 --> 00:10:54.335
00 illegal immigration asylum itself over I support that by the way,

241
00:10:54.346 --> 00:10:57.825
just so everybody knows in terms of revamping our asylum process.

242
00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:00.565
But my point is is that this view was

243
00:11:00.575 --> 00:11:03.536
a minority view within the establishment Republican Party.

244
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:04.455
And the way that, you know,

245
00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:07.125
this crystal is that the US Chamber of Commerce endorsed this bill,

246
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:09.872
it doesn't matter at all. They know, why did they endorse it?

247
00:11:09.882 --> 00:11:12.281
Well, because they like cheap labor. But that's a secondary part.

248
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:15.302
My point is just that the establishment centers of power,

249
00:11:15.312 --> 00:11:17.442
the big business groups and others, which

250
00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:18.851
we combined with the

251
00:11:18.992 --> 00:11:22.992
Koch parties had, I wouldn't say they'd won the argument with voters,

252
00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:25.692
but they certainly had won with the establishment to have a guy

253
00:11:25.702 --> 00:11:28.521
like Langford who comes from that wing of the party who did,

254
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:31.331
you know, even he tried to negotiate something like this and they

255
00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:32.937
just be nuked outright.

256
00:11:32.947 --> 00:11:36.768
I think that demonstrates like a major shift in immigration politics, period.

257
00:11:36.778 --> 00:11:38.497
I also agree with you on the democratic side,

258
00:11:38.617 --> 00:11:40.697
which is, and this is where I,

259
00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:43.898
I actually want to know what you think because for me under Trump,

260
00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:47.687
it was easy to scream about child separation even though Obama did it too.

261
00:11:47.788 --> 00:11:49.148
And all of this and then everyone

262
00:11:49.158 --> 00:11:51.518
just conveniently forgets that whenever it happens.

263
00:11:51.528 --> 00:11:55.418
But to me, the asylum and the images of the border under Biden just became

264
00:11:55.523 --> 00:12:00.343
so untenable within the system that they're trying to use past frameworks to the

265
00:12:00.354 --> 00:12:04.383
for the current problem where you have 6 to 8 million people that cross,

266
00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:06.044
you know, under the Biden administration,

267
00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:08.234
it just seems to have collapsed within its own logic.

268
00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:09.263
-- Well,
-- I mean,

269
00:12:09.504 --> 00:12:14.994
the collapse is a long time coming and predates Joe Biden because basically,

270
00:12:15.004 --> 00:12:19.533
I mean to go back in some of the the history of our immigration system

271
00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:21.250
for a long time,

272
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.330
the overwhelming number of people who were coming to America

273
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.690
were single Mexican males who were coming for work.

274
00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:30.299
And there started to be a shift

275
00:12:30.419 --> 00:12:34.640
um largely driven by the way, by our totally messed up foreign policy.

276
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.159
Vis a vis Guatemala, El Salvador in particular,

277
00:12:37.169 --> 00:12:41.200
where these countries became incredibly violent and it was incredibly dangerous.

278
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.265
And the number of people coming from those northern triangle countries spiked

279
00:12:45.474 --> 00:12:49.344
we have not had a major overhaul of our immigration system

280
00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:51.784
-- since the early nineties we
-- have.

281
00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:57.455
So, so we have a system that even at, it's, you know,

282
00:12:57.465 --> 00:12:59.885
even when it was sort of reflective of

283
00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:02.294
the predominant type of migrant that was coming,

284
00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:05.005
it's not like it was working that well then either.

285
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.159
And, you know,

286
00:13:06.169 --> 00:13:08.809
it's never been updated to be able to process

287
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.119
the number of asylum claims that are coming in.

288
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.880
There's, you know, always been this tension over, OK, who actually is uh

289
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.049
who actually merits asylum.

290
00:13:17.219 --> 00:13:20.109
There's been a massive amount of discrimination between the

291
00:13:20.119 --> 00:13:22.739
types of migrants that will be granted asylum.

292
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.090
For example, if you're from Cuba probably granted asylum.

293
00:13:25.099 --> 00:13:26.239
If you're from Guatemala,

294
00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:28.424
you're not going to be granted asylum.

295
00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:30.734
If you're from Haiti, you're not gonna be granted for asylum.

296
00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:31.715
If you're from El Salvador,

297
00:13:31.724 --> 00:13:35.395
you're not gonna be granted asylum if you're from like a former communist country.

298
00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:38.155
Um you know, escaping persecute Venezuela, for example,

299
00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:39.294
you will be granted asylum.

300
00:13:39.304 --> 00:13:41.914
So it's always been very selective,

301
00:13:41.924 --> 00:13:47.455
very political and largely broken and the resources inadequate to deal

302
00:13:47.465 --> 00:13:50.515
with the number of people who come now claiming asylum.

303
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.659
And that really is the core of the issue.

304
00:13:52.669 --> 00:13:56.289
Now, the other piece of the issue was of course, just a question of like, OK,

305
00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:58.140
but how many people do you want to come?

306
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.530
How many people is appropriate for, you know,

307
00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:03.950
how many people I think there's a practical consideration of how

308
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.609
many people can be absorbed in a nation at a time,

309
00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:08.890
given the amount of resources, et cetera.

310
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.219
My number for that is much higher than your number for that.

311
00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:13.690
Um You know, I mean, that's where we just like wildly differ.

312
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.409
I think we can agree on the need for the additional resources to process the claims.

313
00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:20.349
But when it comes to how many people should come into the country, you know,

314
00:14:20.359 --> 00:14:22.530
I think we, we feel very differently about that.

315
00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:22.849
But

316
00:14:23.299 --> 00:14:26.859
with Joe Biden, what do I think happened that brought him to this place?

317
00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:31.039
First of all, I do think he had this idea of like, oh, I'm gonna call their bluff. And

318
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.099
it's an instinct that we have seen reflected in a bunch of

319
00:14:35.109 --> 00:14:39.070
European nations as well among these sort of like center left neos

320
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.210
where it's like,

321
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.719
oh the right is beating me up on immigration. So let me pretend like I'm on the right.

322
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.640
And I was telling you there was a study that the Guardian wrote up

323
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.260
recently that looked at whether or not that worked electorally and they were like,

324
00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:55.190
no, doesn't work because if people want an immigration asshole, sorry,

325
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.070
then they're gonna vote for the most, you know, for the right wing party.

326
00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.130
At

327
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.750
the same time, you're demoralizing your own base,

328
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.849
Biden as we know because of Israel and other issues.

329
00:15:04.859 --> 00:15:09.239
But in, in particular, because of Israel, his base is already demoralized.

330
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.750
This only further is like another thumb in their eye of

331
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.020
I'm gonna be even harsher on immigration than Donald Trump was.

332
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.229
And I'm gonna completely flip from the messaging that I ran on back in 2020.

333
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.580
So I think electorally it's foolish. I think the other thing that happens

334
00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.530
is because you did have these like, I think the,

335
00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:30.260
the project of bussing migrants into cities.

336
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.580
I think that that was very effective because it is true that, you know,

337
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.710
especially like a city like New York.

338
00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:40.140
Now, I think it's preposterous, the idea that a gigantic city like New York,

339
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.929
a city that in a very short period of time in

340
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.210
the last century gained 30% of its population and is a city

341
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.020
of immigrants

342
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.580
can't handle absorbing 100,000 plus immigrants. I think that's preposterous. But

343
00:15:50.799 --> 00:15:54.200
if people are coming with zero resources all at once and

344
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.299
no work permits even to be able to provide for themselves.

345
00:15:57.469 --> 00:15:59.799
Well, yeah, that's a, that is a drain on resources.

346
00:15:59.809 --> 00:16:01.260
That's a difficult thing to deal with

347
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.979
and they have the right to shelter.

348
00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:06.380
And so Eric Adams is going like, you know, I need help. What are we gonna do?

349
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:09.940
And Kathy Hogel is the same thing and Chicago mayor, same thing.

350
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.799
And so I do think that that also impacted some of

351
00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:15.169
the politics here of how we ended up in this place.

352
00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:16.539
No question. I totally agree.

353
00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:19.650
I actually think that's probably the single most impactful thing.

354
00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:21.409
One of the reasons again why I think it collapsed

355
00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:23.450
on its own logic is Europe is a good example.

356
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.099
So back in 2015, if people will remember,

357
00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:29.770
there was the great Syrian Afghan migrant wave across Europe,

358
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.010
some of which they're still dealing

359
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:31.815
with today,

360
00:16:31.825 --> 00:16:34.856
they had the same level of asylum law that they had to

361
00:16:34.866 --> 00:16:37.015
grapple with which is like how much of this is real?

362
00:16:37.026 --> 00:16:40.596
Most of these guys are military age men. What exactly does this all mean?

363
00:16:40.606 --> 00:16:42.015
Are they trying to stay here?

364
00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:45.575
Are they really fleeing for their lives while also they're from a war torn country?

365
00:16:45.585 --> 00:16:47.466
Can we send them back? Like what do we do?

366
00:16:47.625 --> 00:16:51.815
And that led to, I mean, the rise of places like Victor Orban

367
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:55.002
politics, I was just in Vienna and in Budapest,

368
00:16:55.012 --> 00:16:59.211
both of them told me that the migrant crisis was the single biggest sea change

369
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.992
in all of politics that led to the first breakdown of the Schengen.

370
00:17:02.002 --> 00:17:03.562
And since the 19 nineties,

371
00:17:03.632 --> 00:17:06.921
it really undermined a lot of the internal logic of the European Union.

372
00:17:06.932 --> 00:17:08.702
Even today, there's no massive battles about it.

373
00:17:08.832 --> 00:17:09.602
And you know, Rishi

374
00:17:09.911 --> 00:17:12.901
Soak, for example, he is under massive pressure from his right.

375
00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:14.718
Uh Because of the asylum thing,

376
00:17:14.729 --> 00:17:16.499
arguably Brexit would not have happened if

377
00:17:16.509 --> 00:17:19.548
the German asylum invitee thing had nothing.

378
00:17:19.558 --> 00:17:20.618
So the the politics of it,

379
00:17:20.628 --> 00:17:23.568
I think really comes down to the fact that the law from the

380
00:17:23.578 --> 00:17:26.798
nineties was just not prepared for what the situation was going to be.

381
00:17:26.808 --> 00:17:30.678
I think we can genuinely agree in terms of the policy and all of that.

382
00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:32.588
Now, here, as I said,

383
00:17:32.629 --> 00:17:37.474
it has now been and shifted dramatically to the right for the Republican party now,

384
00:17:37.484 --> 00:17:38.635
depending on where you stand.

385
00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:40.285
I think that's a good thing personally.

386
00:17:40.295 --> 00:17:43.344
But, you know, that's a, it's an overturn window shift nonetheless,

387
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.954
to underscore that guys, can we put this, please up on the screen?

388
00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:47.625
It's the actual whip list,

389
00:17:47.635 --> 00:17:51.224
which is the opposition right now to the Senate border deal.

390
00:17:51.234 --> 00:17:52.785
Uh, that what we see here

391
00:17:53.449 --> 00:17:57.739
in the opposition right now. Crystal is that you have two no votes. Bob Menendez,

392
00:17:57.849 --> 00:17:59.290
Alex Padilla, actually, I believe Bernie

393
00:17:59.420 --> 00:17:59.709
Sanders

394
00:18:00.199 --> 00:18:03.050
-- has been added to that
-- as well. I think um Mary

395
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.290
and uh there's one more that I think there's

396
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.670
-- five Democratic or Bernie and Independent no
-- votes.

397
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.160
A lot of this is moving quickly. So we're to

398
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.790
our best.

399
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.530
The reason why this is important is that right now,

400
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.439
it is going to be very difficult for this to even get to 60 votes.

401
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.569
The reason why that would matter is that if it's at 60 then it can't,

402
00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:26.349
even if it doesn't get 60 votes, it will not even be able to get closure.

403
00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:29.390
The secondary thing that is very important to understand here,

404
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.453
if we could put a three please up on the

405
00:18:31.463 --> 00:18:34.843
screen is that the House of Representatives has already declared.

406
00:18:34.853 --> 00:18:37.843
This is a joint statement from Speaker Johnson Steve Scalise,

407
00:18:37.853 --> 00:18:41.012
who's the House majority whip and Elise Stefanik have

408
00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:43.133
all a statement that they've put out and say that

409
00:18:43.142 --> 00:18:47.392
the Senate supplemental says any consideration of this Senate bill

410
00:18:47.402 --> 00:18:49.562
in its current form is a waste of time.

411
00:18:49.572 --> 00:18:53.383
It is dead capital D on arrival in the house.

412
00:18:53.392 --> 00:18:56.902
We encourage the US Senate to reject it that as I understand it,

413
00:18:56.912 --> 00:18:58.383
Crystal is actually playing a huge part

414
00:18:58.865 --> 00:19:03.115
in undermining many of the votes in the Senate because many Republicans do not

415
00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:06.336
want to take a risky vote on immigration if they know that it's not,

416
00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:07.076
I mean, it makes sense.

417
00:19:07.086 --> 00:19:09.105
Obviously, you know, you don't want to take a bill already.

418
00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:10.206
Senator Lankford, by the way,

419
00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:14.095
is under massive fire amongst the GOP faithful from

420
00:19:14.105 --> 00:19:17.066
what I've seen Trump basically disavowed him yesterday.

421
00:19:17.076 --> 00:19:20.446
Even though plot twist, he endorsed him. Also, many de

422
00:19:20.615 --> 00:19:24.105
scientist voters are passing this around in his endorsement of Senator Lankford.

423
00:19:24.115 --> 00:19:25.855
He said he's strong on the border.

424
00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:27.479
You can't even make it up.

425
00:19:27.489 --> 00:19:32.500
I mean, but this bill is strong on the butt like this bill which

426
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.640
no, this compared to the status quo.

427
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.439
If you're in favor of restrictionist immigration policies,

428
00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:41.979
this makes it much more stringent,

429
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.630
it makes it, you know, much more towards the Republican vision. And I have to say

430
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.869
for me, what this reminds me of is, I don't know if you guys remember,

431
00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.140
I know you remember back in the Obama days when there was all this grand bargain,

432
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.589
we're gonna try to get a grand bargain.

433
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:56.420
And, um, which meant like, you know,

434
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.439
cutting social security and Medicare basically,

435
00:19:58.449 --> 00:20:01.609
and Obama came to the table with a deal like here t tea party,

436
00:20:01.619 --> 00:20:03.219
I'm gonna cave to your wishes

437
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:07.349
and I'm gonna put cuts to social security and Medicare on the table.

438
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.709
And because they, you know,

439
00:20:09.719 --> 00:20:12.469
I think it was probably some of the same logic if they didn't want to quote unquote,

440
00:20:12.479 --> 00:20:13.670
give Obama a win.

441
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.390
But also, you know, the stated reason was like, oh,

442
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.140
this doesn't go far enough and this doesn't do enough.

443
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.989
So the tea party did,

444
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.630
you know the work of people like me who don't

445
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.089
want to see those programs cut and killed that initiative

446
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.949
and guess what? That never came around again.

447
00:20:29.219 --> 00:20:31.680
And so, you know, I think first of all, it's,

448
00:20:31.689 --> 00:20:35.560
it's very uncertain whether Donald Trump is going to end up in the White House.

449
00:20:35.569 --> 00:20:37.790
I think it's a 5050 prospect. That's number one,

450
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.300
there's no way he's going to have a filibuster proof majority and control of the

451
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.439
house and be able to just like do whatever he wants on the border.

452
00:20:44.449 --> 00:20:48.400
Now, he can do what he wants to do with executive action, but that's always limited

453
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.969
both in what you can do

454
00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.790
and also in the duration of how long that lasts.

455
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:56.920
So if you actually want to quote unquote,

456
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.900
close the border and limit asylum and all of

457
00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.300
these things like this is probably your best chance um

458
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.890
under a Democratic President Democrats, like I said,

459
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.609
would never agree to something that was so enforcement heavy

460
00:21:10.739 --> 00:21:14.130
um under, you know, under Trump or under Republican president.

461
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.709
So I think this probably is their best chance they actually care about, you know,

462
00:21:17.719 --> 00:21:19.880
the restrictionist policies that they claim to care about.

463
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.010
Just to give you one example,

464
00:21:21.369 --> 00:21:24.920
this bill would more than double the budget of ice.

465
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.959
It would give the uh DH S Secretary unilateral powers to

466
00:21:30.969 --> 00:21:34.130
deport as many people as he or she wants to deport.

467
00:21:34.369 --> 00:21:37.410
These are powers that this is again, from the Democratic perspective.

468
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.630
I think this is insane

469
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:39.479
like yes,

470
00:21:39.489 --> 00:21:42.579
you're giving these powers right now to Joe Biden and Joe Biden's administration.

471
00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:45.510
But if Trump wins, you're giving those powers to Trump and his administration.

472
00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:49.699
Are you really comfortable with that and the way that they would use those powers?

473
00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:55.089
So again, I think if you actually, you know, back the rhetoric that they back

474
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.290
and believe in a restriction is policy,

475
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.489
this is probably the best deal you're gonna get.

476
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.969
And I am incredibly delighted,

477
00:22:00.979 --> 00:22:03.650
especially when you pair it with Ukraine and Israel aid

478
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.390
that they wanna. Well, and there we can agree

479
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.369
that they want to kill this thing and that

480
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.219
-- it's quote unquote dead on arrival in the
-- house.

481
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:13.290
I'll give you the case that I have heard, which is mcconnell's an old man.

482
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.569
He's either gonna die or he's not gonna be there very soon.

483
00:22:15.656 --> 00:22:17.816
And uh he's the only person who was standing Trump

484
00:22:17.826 --> 00:22:19.556
actually encouraged him to nuke the filibuster in the,

485
00:22:19.566 --> 00:22:20.676
in the case of uh uh

486
00:22:20.836 --> 00:22:23.956
for border enforcement deal. If we remember for the border wall.

487
00:22:23.965 --> 00:22:26.556
Hr Two already passed the House of Representatives.

488
00:22:26.566 --> 00:22:30.095
Hr Two goes much farther than this. I'm a very strong supporter of hr two.

489
00:22:30.105 --> 00:22:32.166
I think it's a great bill on immigration.

490
00:22:32.176 --> 00:22:34.026
It completely reforms asylum and a very different

491
00:22:34.036 --> 00:22:36.365
policy endorsed also by the Border Patrol Union.

492
00:22:36.546 --> 00:22:39.166
By the way, this bill is endorsed by the border.

493
00:22:39.176 --> 00:22:41.355
-- That's why I wanted
-- to talk about this. So I did some digging.

494
00:22:41.365 --> 00:22:43.836
I, I asked some of my immigration friends, I go, what the hell are these doing?

495
00:22:43.845 --> 00:22:45.225
Because I was, I was like this

496
00:22:45.442 --> 00:22:47.462
be real Brandon Judd, who I know by the way,

497
00:22:47.472 --> 00:22:50.202
Brandon was the head of the border patrol unit.

498
00:22:50.212 --> 00:22:52.261
I used to work with him quite a bit in the past.

499
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:52.862
So Crystal,

500
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:54.641
one of the reasons the Border Patrol Union supports

501
00:22:54.651 --> 00:22:56.621
this is because it dramatically increases their pay.

502
00:22:56.631 --> 00:22:58.092
It's not just over asylum, but

503
00:22:58.592 --> 00:22:59.141
they, I mean,

504
00:22:59.151 --> 00:23:01.671
what they wrote in their endorsement is this gives us

505
00:23:01.682 --> 00:23:03.702
-- like the strongest set of tools that we've ever
-- had.

506
00:23:03.712 --> 00:23:04.021
That's true.

507
00:23:04.161 --> 00:23:05.521
Yeah, absolutely no question.

508
00:23:05.531 --> 00:23:06.802
But again, my case,

509
00:23:06.812 --> 00:23:10.781
the case that I have heard from those who say is look mitch is going to be gone.

510
00:23:10.791 --> 00:23:12.832
We already have the house. We've won the argument.

511
00:23:12.842 --> 00:23:13.202
Now,

512
00:23:13.212 --> 00:23:14.531
the senators are going to vote the way that we

513
00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:17.167
tell them to if we nuke the filibuster for,

514
00:23:17.177 --> 00:23:18.137
uh, we know many,

515
00:23:18.177 --> 00:23:20.517
many Republicans who are not named Mitch mcconnell

516
00:23:20.527 --> 00:23:21.937
are very open to nuking the Filibuster.

517
00:23:21.947 --> 00:23:23.008
And they're like, we'll just pass our

518
00:23:23.137 --> 00:23:24.348
immigration bill. I know you're

519
00:23:24.697 --> 00:23:25.537
Filibuster too. So

520
00:23:26.378 --> 00:23:26.897
maybe,

521
00:23:26.998 --> 00:23:29.407
but there's no reason why you couldn't do that.

522
00:23:29.598 --> 00:23:32.667
You couldn't pass this bill and then still do that down the road.

523
00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:33.598
I think like that doesn't for

524
00:23:33.897 --> 00:23:34.728
the possibility to

525
00:23:35.088 --> 00:23:37.578
-- kill
-- as island down the road, the DH S secretary, you know,

526
00:23:37.588 --> 00:23:38.787
gets unilateral authority.

527
00:23:38.797 --> 00:23:39.578
Well, Republicans don't try.

528
00:23:39.588 --> 00:23:41.157
They're impeaching him right now because they say

529
00:23:41.167 --> 00:23:42.767
that he's not following the law for them.

530
00:23:42.777 --> 00:23:44.777
It's actually one of the reasons not to give

531
00:23:45.014 --> 00:23:46.183
power to my, I

532
00:23:47.203 --> 00:23:48.073
mean, but that, no,

533
00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:53.104
it gives him unilateral authority to deport as many people as he wants to report.

534
00:23:53.264 --> 00:23:53.333
So

535
00:23:53.624 --> 00:23:54.343
that's not like

536
00:23:54.734 --> 00:23:57.874
it's not like unilateral authority to give them an amnesty.

537
00:23:57.884 --> 00:23:59.514
It just goes in one direction.

538
00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:03.014
So your worst case scenario is, you know, the status quo.

539
00:24:03.024 --> 00:24:05.284
Well, if you give somebody a work permit and you don't deport them,

540
00:24:05.293 --> 00:24:07.874
that basically is amnesty because when the hell are they gonna leave?

541
00:24:07.884 --> 00:24:08.764
I mean, that's kind of the,

542
00:24:08.774 --> 00:24:11.394
-- but
-- here's the thing just on a substantive level that

543
00:24:11.404 --> 00:24:13.473
I genuinely don't understand and I want to hear your,

544
00:24:13.484 --> 00:24:14.673
your analysis of

545
00:24:15.239 --> 00:24:15.859
Republicans.

546
00:24:15.869 --> 00:24:18.949
We've covered this on the show a bunch of times, talk about, you know,

547
00:24:18.959 --> 00:24:22.199
all these people who are leaving New York, going to Texas,

548
00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:23.510
going to Florida

549
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.449
and that's seen as like that internal migration is seen as like,

550
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.560
I think justifiably so terrible for New York

551
00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:33.329
and terrible for California and fantastic for Texas

552
00:24:33.619 --> 00:24:34.910
and fantastic for Florida.

553
00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:38.119
But suddenly when it's people who are coming from outside the country,

554
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.969
even though they're also just human beings.

555
00:24:39.979 --> 00:24:40.949
And by the way, immigrants,

556
00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:42.959
like some of the clearly like hardest

557
00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:45.020
working and oftentimes most patriotic people,

558
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.979
you can possibly be

559
00:24:46.359 --> 00:24:49.099
suddenly when they're coming from out of the country. When they come to New York.

560
00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:50.699
It's like, oh my God, this is terrible for New York.

561
00:24:50.709 --> 00:24:54.250
So how is it that people leaving is bad? But also people coming is bad.

562
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.339
-- It's
-- a philosophical difference.

563
00:24:55.349 --> 00:24:55.650
Crystal,

564
00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.880
which is that the first part of your people are lawful permanent residents and

565
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.034
they're American citizens and the people who are coming here uh are not.

566
00:25:02.043 --> 00:25:02.784
And in most they

567
00:25:02.923 --> 00:25:03.063
could be

568
00:25:03.624 --> 00:25:05.573
maybe, but you know, they don't pay taxes.

569
00:25:05.723 --> 00:25:05.774
A

570
00:25:06.024 --> 00:25:06.463
lot of them don't speak

571
00:25:06.803 --> 00:25:07.534
-- English. That
-- would be

572
00:25:07.683 --> 00:25:08.014
that.

573
00:25:08.024 --> 00:25:11.573
But that would be an argument for a pathway to citizenship, to legalizing them,

574
00:25:11.583 --> 00:25:13.203
bringing them out of the shadows because yeah,

575
00:25:13.213 --> 00:25:16.764
the problem and this is one of the arguments about like, oh, it depresses the wages.

576
00:25:16.774 --> 00:25:18.354
What depresses wages

577
00:25:18.484 --> 00:25:22.693
is when you have people who are not legalized, who are in the shadows,

578
00:25:22.703 --> 00:25:23.984
who are being paid under the table,

579
00:25:23.994 --> 00:25:25.894
oftentimes like less than minimum wage and

580
00:25:25.904 --> 00:25:27.667
not having to abide by labor regulations.

581
00:25:27.907 --> 00:25:30.868
What you're making is an argument for legalizing

582
00:25:31.088 --> 00:25:31.787
immigrants,

583
00:25:31.797 --> 00:25:35.378
for allowing in more legal immigrants versus having this massive shadow.

584
00:25:35.387 --> 00:25:37.008
-- I actually don't support
-- legalizing immigrants

585
00:25:37.017 --> 00:25:38.447
and I don't support pathway to citizenship

586
00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:40.417
for the vast majority of people here and I'll tell you why.

587
00:25:40.427 --> 00:25:42.667
Which is that as fundamentally is a fairness issue.

588
00:25:42.677 --> 00:25:44.777
People like my parents spent years and

589
00:25:44.937 --> 00:25:48.187
tens of thousands of dollars on lawyers trying to get visas.

590
00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:51.868
They had phd S and master's degrees. It's not that easy for people to get

591
00:25:52.088 --> 00:25:54.832
a visa to this country. You can ask anybody who's like me.

592
00:25:55.082 --> 00:25:58.612
Uh I think it's bullshit frankly that you can just cross the border.

593
00:25:58.621 --> 00:26:01.491
Just say I fear for my life because El Salvador sucks and

594
00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:04.381
you get to stay here and you get to work for 5,

595
00:26:04.391 --> 00:26:07.771
10 years lively, never leave the other case.

596
00:26:07.781 --> 00:26:08.621
And this is, look,

597
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:10.812
you can call me racist if you want vast

598
00:26:10.822 --> 00:26:12.631
majority of people arriving here have no skills.

599
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:16.651
We're lucky if they have 1/5 grade reading level in Spanish, let alone in English.

600
00:26:16.661 --> 00:26:17.751
They're not educated

601
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:19.755
in terms of the jobs that they're gonna take.

602
00:26:19.765 --> 00:26:24.326
I mean, is it really fair to depress like wages for the lower class Americans? I

603
00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:24.656
mean,

604
00:26:25.005 --> 00:26:25.206
the

605
00:26:26.605 --> 00:26:27.456
supply and demand,

606
00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.656
it's your assumption is that there are some set

607
00:26:30.666 --> 00:26:32.355
number of jobs in the economy and that's it.

608
00:26:32.365 --> 00:26:34.355
End of story. It doesn't shift. So again,

609
00:26:34.566 --> 00:26:39.186
it comes back to, ok, then why is it a great thing for New Yorkers to be moving to Texas?

610
00:26:39.196 --> 00:26:40.125
Why is that great for Texas?

611
00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:43.395
Why isn't that them taking their jobs and depressing their wages and

612
00:26:43.745 --> 00:26:44.365
ruining their

613
00:26:45.349 --> 00:26:45.739
etcetera?

614
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.300
Many people in my home state of Texas would say it's ruining

615
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:50.459
their community and it is driving prices up because of the.

616
00:26:50.569 --> 00:26:50.660
Yeah.

617
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.140
But they brag about, oh, all the moving vans coming here to Florida and to Texas.

618
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.219
But when it's, when it's, you know, American citizens coming from New York,

619
00:26:59.229 --> 00:27:01.959
then it's amazing and it's great for the economy, et cetera, et cetera.

620
00:27:01.969 --> 00:27:04.319
But somehow, even though it's just also people,

621
00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:06.150
they just happen to be coming from outside the country,

622
00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.079
then suddenly it's terrible.

623
00:27:07.089 --> 00:27:07.640
-- Doesn't that make
-- sense?

624
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.189
I just think there's a fundamental difference between a

625
00:27:09.199 --> 00:27:11.423
guy who makes 250 $1000 from New York and

626
00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:13.394
moves to Austin who's paying taxes and can buy

627
00:27:13.404 --> 00:27:14.644
a house and somebody who comes here with,

628
00:27:15.404 --> 00:27:16.744
I think that's so classist

629
00:27:17.093 --> 00:27:17.254
because

630
00:27:19.034 --> 00:27:19.104
they're

631
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:19.254
not

632
00:27:19.543 --> 00:27:19.573
here.

633
00:27:19.884 --> 00:27:19.973
They

634
00:27:21.374 --> 00:27:23.354
think about. But I'm ok.

635
00:27:23.364 --> 00:27:27.254
Put aside like, you know, who deserves what et cetera, et cetera. Just

636
00:27:27.394 --> 00:27:29.124
think about the best interests of the country.

637
00:27:29.413 --> 00:27:30.764
Like it's very clear

638
00:27:31.014 --> 00:27:33.524
that some level of immigration

639
00:27:33.703 --> 00:27:36.004
and you can see it again when we're talking about internal migration

640
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.760
is very good for local economies.

641
00:27:38.969 --> 00:27:40.170
And you know what,

642
00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:43.660
what we have seen as a nation of immigrants

643
00:27:43.969 --> 00:27:46.729
is that in the subsequent waves of immigration,

644
00:27:46.849 --> 00:27:51.079
some of the hardest working people, most family oriented people, et cetera

645
00:27:51.239 --> 00:27:53.449
and more law abiding by the way,

646
00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:54.500
are immigrants

647
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.439
depends on the type. But

648
00:27:55.699 --> 00:27:56.859
no, not true.

649
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.739
If you look overall

650
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.709
immigrant populations, more law abiding than native born citizens,

651
00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:03.390
not to mention,

652
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:04.310
yes,

653
00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:06.959
when they first come and they're learning the language and

654
00:28:06.969 --> 00:28:08.869
they're new et cetera and they're bringing their cultures,

655
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.569
we all know what the next generation looks like.

656
00:28:10.579 --> 00:28:14.060
They just look like Americans, their kids are gonna speak English, they're gonna be

657
00:28:14.189 --> 00:28:17.400
-- 100% American. Well,
-- it depends. Look, George Borjas

658
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.640
who works over at Harvard University has done a 2017 fantastic study which

659
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.630
shows that mass illegal immigration largely

660
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.869
depresses wages for lower class Americans.

661
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.650
So that's number one,

662
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.540
I would say the empirical data is pretty set on

663
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.819
this in terms of the laws of supply and demand.

664
00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:30.949
But

665
00:28:31.055 --> 00:28:34.064
number two again, is a deep philosophical difference.

666
00:28:34.074 --> 00:28:35.984
I think that the net migration level that we should

667
00:28:35.994 --> 00:28:38.295
have over the next 30 years should be zero.

668
00:28:38.305 --> 00:28:41.185
And this is my case again, it's against and, and look, people will be like,

669
00:28:41.194 --> 00:28:43.255
how can a guy, son of Indian immigrants, by the way,

670
00:28:43.265 --> 00:28:45.494
my mom vehemently disagrees with me if anybody wants to know and

671
00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:47.505
she also votes so she can vote the way that she wants.

672
00:28:47.525 --> 00:28:48.535
If people want to know,

673
00:28:48.645 --> 00:28:49.234
I'll tell you.

674
00:28:49.244 --> 00:28:54.395
Which is that in the 19 nineteens and the teens, we had a hyphenated American crisis.

675
00:28:54.405 --> 00:28:57.984
Very similar to the one that we have here. Mass internal strife,

676
00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.069
complete differences of opinion.

677
00:29:00.189 --> 00:29:03.199
People speak German, people speaking Italian.

678
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.599
They had dual loyalty to their old countries.

679
00:29:05.609 --> 00:29:08.810
As we saw during the world of the first World War. It was a huge problem.

680
00:29:08.819 --> 00:29:12.800
We had a massive foreign born population equivalent only to today,

681
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.959
internal strife was solved one way,

682
00:29:14.969 --> 00:29:17.500
we dramatically lowered the level of immigration.

683
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.079
We let people assimilate into the country.

684
00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:24.199
And for the next 40 to 50 years, we had very, very little immigration.

685
00:29:24.209 --> 00:29:25.189
Now that is my case

686
00:29:25.744 --> 00:29:25.795
for

687
00:29:26.104 --> 00:29:28.045
becoming a cohesive nation,

688
00:29:28.074 --> 00:29:31.665
which can have a true national identity and

689
00:29:31.675 --> 00:29:34.045
one where the foreign born population where it is

690
00:29:34.055 --> 00:29:36.435
currently at an all time high should not

691
00:29:36.444 --> 00:29:39.805
continue to be higher with the orderly process.

692
00:29:39.814 --> 00:29:42.344
I will also say many Indians will be pissed off at what I'm

693
00:29:42.354 --> 00:29:46.744
saying because I'm also claiming that legal immigration should go to net zero.

694
00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:48.564
And I strongly believe it because I do

695
00:29:48.574 --> 00:29:52.324
believe that our current sovereignty and internal politics is

696
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.609
so divisive largely because we do not relate to one another whatsoever.

697
00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:58.540
-- And that really has
-- nothing to do with immigration.

698
00:29:59.089 --> 00:29:59.260
I mean,

699
00:29:59.390 --> 00:29:59.420
it's

700
00:29:59.560 --> 00:29:59.599
just

701
00:29:59.770 --> 00:29:59.969
not

702
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.750
even if you look at like the the political divide

703
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.250
is, has never been actually less racially polarized than it is, right. Now.

704
00:30:08.459 --> 00:30:10.109
And in fact, Republicans are winning.

705
00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:11.910
This is the other thing with all this, like, great replacement.

706
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.349
Oh, they want to bring in all these immigrants just so they can vote for Democrats.

707
00:30:14.359 --> 00:30:17.069
Like that's actually happening less and less. And Republicans,

708
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.449
republicans love to brag about how they're winning over

709
00:30:19.555 --> 00:30:23.255
population, but also fear monger about how they could never win this population.

710
00:30:23.265 --> 00:30:25.285
So that's another part of the conversation that I

711
00:30:25.295 --> 00:30:28.464
think makes absolutely no sense and is utterly ridiculous.

712
00:30:28.625 --> 00:30:29.814
The divide in this country.

713
00:30:29.984 --> 00:30:31.494
Yeah, some are, you know,

714
00:30:31.505 --> 00:30:33.954
there are some racial divisions but increasingly

715
00:30:33.964 --> 00:30:37.614
we're actually less polarized among racial lines.

716
00:30:37.625 --> 00:30:42.334
And, you know, I would, I would wager and I think most people would agree

717
00:30:42.494 --> 00:30:46.564
that ultimately, the country was much better for those waves of Irish

718
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.550
and Italian and Polish and German immigrants.

719
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.270
I mean, that's part of what has made this country, what it is.

720
00:30:52.439 --> 00:30:56.439
And I don't see this new wave of migrants coming from a different part of the world

721
00:30:56.609 --> 00:30:58.099
in any different way.

722
00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.430
So listen, is there, is there a limit to how much we can, you know,

723
00:31:01.439 --> 00:31:03.479
bring it at one time just again, you know,

724
00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:06.150
practically if you flood the zone with a whole bunch

725
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.359
of new people and that creates housing that there's,

726
00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:08.900
there's problems.

727
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.689
I'm not gonna say that there's like, you know,

728
00:31:10.699 --> 00:31:13.729
you can just bring in the whole world and it's not gonna call cause an issue.

729
00:31:14.109 --> 00:31:15.930
But I do think that there is something

730
00:31:15.939 --> 00:31:19.410
fundamentally broken in a logic that would say,

731
00:31:19.589 --> 00:31:24.329
you know, it's very clear when a place like the industrial midwest empties out

732
00:31:24.589 --> 00:31:28.589
and these towns are decaying and people are fleeing. It's very clear.

733
00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:30.270
That's like, that's a bad thing.

734
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.650
It's very clear when it's New York and people are leaving New York,

735
00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.770
that that's a bad thing.

736
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.229
But then somehow when it's other people who are coming in,

737
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.000
which in a different scenario, if they, you know, came from a different country,

738
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.910
a different part of the world, you say this is great.

739
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.910
This is wonderful. Somehow. That's terrible. It just doesn't make any sense to me.

740
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.550
And I don't think that the studies back up,

741
00:31:48.839 --> 00:31:55.270
the studies show that if you have a massive undocumented illegal workforce,

742
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.020
that that can be a problem for wages, actually documented immigrants.

743
00:31:59.219 --> 00:32:03.229
The overwhelming majority of studies show it's actually good for, it's

744
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.969
neutral on wages

745
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.339
in,

746
00:32:05.349 --> 00:32:10.540
in general is good for the economy and helps for the like thriving of that local area.

747
00:32:10.709 --> 00:32:14.020
So that's why, you know, again, I'm not like open borders just, you know,

748
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.180
let's have an unlimited number, but I think we can handle a lot more than we have.

749
00:32:18.189 --> 00:32:21.290
I think it'd be good for all kinds of people, all kinds of parts of the country.

750
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.640
And I also just think it's fundamentally like

751
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.819
goes against some core American values,

752
00:32:26.829 --> 00:32:29.000
this complete attack on the asylum process.

753
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:29.900
And this idea that

754
00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:33.729
we don't care if you're being persecuted. We don't care if you fear for your lives.

755
00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:35.079
You know, we don't care if you're like, you know,

756
00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:37.349
a Jew trying to escape Nazi Germany or whatever

757
00:32:38.219 --> 00:32:38.979
it is, you're

758
00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:39.380
the

759
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:41.239
process. It is. People are not.

760
00:32:42.469 --> 00:32:42.979
No, but some

761
00:32:43.089 --> 00:32:43.229
people

762
00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.810
-- you flee gang
-- violence

763
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.130
but hold on, hold on.

764
00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.969
But if you end the asylum process,

765
00:32:47.979 --> 00:32:50.010
you are telling people who would potentially be

766
00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.770
fleeing a holocaust like we don't care.

767
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.890
That's too bad. We're full.

768
00:32:53.021 --> 00:32:55.302
What we could say is if there's a future holocaust, then sure,

769
00:32:55.312 --> 00:32:58.041
we on a case by case basis, we can evaluate what's going to happen.

770
00:32:58.052 --> 00:33:00.651
And again, I would even say, is that the

771
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:05.842
OK, El Salvador, uh let's currently look, everyone likes to talk about root causes.

772
00:33:05.852 --> 00:33:07.161
Well, what just happened?

773
00:33:07.171 --> 00:33:10.521
We just had a mass election of a right wing

774
00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:15.732
authoritarian president who threw all the criminals in jail and dramatic

775
00:33:15.854 --> 00:33:21.104
lowered their murder rate. That proves they are adults with agency.

776
00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:23.953
They can elect leaders who want to deal with their problems

777
00:33:23.963 --> 00:33:27.193
and deal with their own problems and stay where they are.

778
00:33:27.203 --> 00:33:31.693
El Salvador's problems are El Salvador's. Venezuela's problems are Venezuela's.

779
00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:35.754
Has it been exacerbated by us? Sanctions? Sure. But at the end of the day, who can?

780
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:38.394
It's not our problem, it's not our fault,

781
00:33:38.686 --> 00:33:41.885
-- your country, if your country sucks, it's your responsibility to fix
-- it.

782
00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:43.385
But see, I just look at this totally different.

783
00:33:43.395 --> 00:33:44.985
I mean, first of all, like, you know,

784
00:33:44.995 --> 00:33:47.365
we can't exempt ourselves from the foreign policy

785
00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:49.336
that we up until very recently were,

786
00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:51.505
you know, screwing over these countries or

787
00:33:51.635 --> 00:33:52.576
the drug war

788
00:33:52.796 --> 00:33:55.156
that has, is one of the, you know,

789
00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:59.566
most critical root causes in making many of these places incredibly violent.

790
00:33:59.576 --> 00:34:01.426
But even if you put that aside, like I said, like,

791
00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.839
I don't see this as like a punishment.

792
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.369
I think if you, if you look at it through another lens of, you know,

793
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.688
typically it's a great thing when people want to move

794
00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.330
to a place when they wanna move to Florida.

795
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:11.679
Somehow.

796
00:34:11.688 --> 00:34:14.379
It's a great thing, you know, when they wanna move to Texas, somehow,

797
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:15.228
it's a great thing.

798
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.688
So I don't see this as like, oh,

799
00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:19.560
we're being punished by having to clean up other people's messes.

800
00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:22.590
No, I think we should have a process that's orderly.

801
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.550
I think we should have enough resources to be able

802
00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.330
to deal with the number of people that are coming.

803
00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:29.760
I think we should have an ability, you know, a system that makes sense

804
00:34:29.889 --> 00:34:30.429
that lets in

805
00:34:30.541 --> 00:34:34.902
a certain number, you know, that's not gonna overwhelm the entire country,

806
00:34:34.971 --> 00:34:37.902
but we should in general see it as a good thing that people want to come

807
00:34:37.911 --> 00:34:40.690
to the United States of America and still see it as the land of opportunity.

808
00:34:40.701 --> 00:34:41.951
You should see it as a land of opportunity.

809
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.302
It should be,

810
00:34:42.312 --> 00:34:43.572
it should be a land of opportunity for people

811
00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:45.531
who live here and people who are natural born,

812
00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:46.641
-- us citizens or a
-- lot.

813
00:34:46.661 --> 00:34:47.431
But I don't see how this,

814
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:51.422
but that's the thing is like you see this as a zero sum game and it's not,

815
00:34:51.431 --> 00:34:53.081
-- it's not like
-- I said,

816
00:34:53.241 --> 00:34:54.721
there's a lot of data to back it up.

817
00:34:54.731 --> 00:34:55.052
Now,

818
00:34:55.062 --> 00:34:57.041
in terms of the difference between the Irish

819
00:34:57.052 --> 00:34:59.201
and the German is we were rapidly industrial

820
00:34:59.444 --> 00:35:01.283
economy which needed cheap labor.

821
00:35:01.293 --> 00:35:04.503
I would also say that a lot of people who were natural born,

822
00:35:04.513 --> 00:35:08.634
hated the Irish and the Germans with some good reason because they were depleting

823
00:35:08.644 --> 00:35:11.374
their wages or are willing to work for much less than they were.

824
00:35:11.384 --> 00:35:13.134
And they were driving around their overall wages,

825
00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:17.194
which led to major labor disputes even within unions at the time.

826
00:35:17.303 --> 00:35:17.783
So

827
00:35:17.894 --> 00:35:20.614
that played out 100 years ago, but that was 100 years ago.

828
00:35:20.624 --> 00:35:21.974
And we can say what it is today.

829
00:35:21.983 --> 00:35:23.743
We are not a rapidly industrializing

830
00:35:23.753 --> 00:35:26.303
economy or rapidly de industrializing economy.

831
00:35:26.313 --> 00:35:27.974
We don't need a lot of cheap labor,

832
00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:31.746
the predominant amount of cheap labor that does come here and ends up working,

833
00:35:31.756 --> 00:35:34.206
working in places like home health care space.

834
00:35:34.355 --> 00:35:37.795
They don't, uh they end up depressing wages in places like construction

835
00:35:37.956 --> 00:35:40.895
and others. And there's also we have a housing supply issue.

836
00:35:40.906 --> 00:35:43.226
I mean, you know, like where are these people going to live?

837
00:35:43.236 --> 00:35:44.746
But then look, this is,

838
00:35:44.756 --> 00:35:47.196
this is why I don't even like to have an economic argument as much.

839
00:35:47.246 --> 00:35:52.555
It's about process and it's about legality if you don't, if, for example,

840
00:35:52.565 --> 00:35:55.186
and you're using the ones about, uh, El Salvador.

841
00:35:55.196 --> 00:35:56.625
Why is it fair that we

842
00:35:57.048 --> 00:35:59.437
in Iraq and Iraqis can't just walk here?

843
00:35:59.447 --> 00:36:02.758
Don't they have more right to live here than anyone in El Salvador, I would say.

844
00:36:02.768 --> 00:36:04.308
-- Yeah, absolutely.
-- Let them in.

845
00:36:05.508 --> 00:36:05.528
They

846
00:36:05.748 --> 00:36:05.927
can't,

847
00:36:07.288 --> 00:36:10.238
we, we do have special programs for, um, I think Iraqis,

848
00:36:10.248 --> 00:36:12.298
but definitely Afghan interpreters

849
00:36:12.437 --> 00:36:14.318
as well who helped us in our war.

850
00:36:14.397 --> 00:36:15.657
-- So
-- absolutely clarity,

851
00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:21.837
but not every random Iraqi who happened to live in the country between 2003 and 2020.

852
00:36:21.847 --> 00:36:25.478
It's just not, it's not a fair process that just because you can walk across Mexico

853
00:36:25.629 --> 00:36:28.360
or if you're some Chinese or Haitian or whatever

854
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:30.810
that Somali or whatever you can afford a ticket

855
00:36:30.929 --> 00:36:33.030
to there that, that puts you ahead of the line.

856
00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:36.320
And the reason that these are all men is because it

857
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.649
is based upon a belief that you can come here,

858
00:36:38.659 --> 00:36:40.770
you can Western Union, your money back.

859
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:44.449
And most of these countries just so people know huge portions of their

860
00:36:44.459 --> 00:36:47.439
economy come from illegal labor and Western

861
00:36:47.449 --> 00:36:49.689
Union transfers from the United States,

862
00:36:49.719 --> 00:36:50.989
they're called remittances.

863
00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.290
There was a huge uh effort in the Trump years to try and

864
00:36:54.402 --> 00:36:56.582
tax remittances which of course the Republicans quash.

865
00:36:56.592 --> 00:36:59.342
But you know, it's secondary for the conversation right now.

866
00:36:59.352 --> 00:37:03.342
My only point is that it has to be orderly. I think we agree.

867
00:37:03.352 --> 00:37:05.132
But on the net benefit,

868
00:37:05.142 --> 00:37:09.672
I totally disagree that a bunch of people who cannot even speak English,

869
00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:12.102
the vast majority of these people, some of them don't even speak Spanish.

870
00:37:12.112 --> 00:37:13.001
I think a lot of people don't,

871
00:37:13.191 --> 00:37:14.701
-- this
-- may be controversial on the left.

872
00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:16.961
Like I don't actually have a problem with part of

873
00:37:16.971 --> 00:37:20.142
the citizenship process being a requirement to speak English.

874
00:37:20.152 --> 00:37:22.842
So make that a requirement. I mean, that's the thing is you can't say that

875
00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:23.813
you can't say,

876
00:37:24.454 --> 00:37:25.474
but you can't say

877
00:37:25.604 --> 00:37:29.634
you have to follow the process, but then there is no process to follow and,

878
00:37:29.644 --> 00:37:33.293
and be like, also I'm gonna make sure that there is no process to follow.

879
00:37:33.323 --> 00:37:36.354
I just, you know, I think that's fundamentally unfair

880
00:37:36.533 --> 00:37:38.664
and, you know, the other thing is like,

881
00:37:38.924 --> 00:37:41.154
there's this assumption that everyone in the world

882
00:37:41.164 --> 00:37:43.194
would come to the United States of America.

883
00:37:43.204 --> 00:37:43.634
They could

884
00:37:43.964 --> 00:37:47.164
and that's just not borne out by the data even among um you know,

885
00:37:47.174 --> 00:37:51.833
there's a lot of focus on the like Central and South American migrants who come here.

886
00:37:52.199 --> 00:37:56.050
Um There's far more Venezuelans who have migrated

887
00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:59.810
to neighboring countries to Venezuela than there are,

888
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.270
who have attempted to come here.

889
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.520
People typically they wanna, you know, if they're under pressure, first of all,

890
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.659
most people don't want to leave their homes.

891
00:38:07.669 --> 00:38:10.860
And I think anyone out there could relate to like you, like where you live

892
00:38:11.024 --> 00:38:13.604
have a certain level of comfort like you wanna stay in your home.

893
00:38:13.614 --> 00:38:16.324
So already, if you're like, I have to migrate,

894
00:38:16.334 --> 00:38:18.364
this is a pretty extraordinary circumstance.

895
00:38:18.574 --> 00:38:19.955
Then most people,

896
00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:22.784
the overall majority of migrants are looking to go

897
00:38:22.794 --> 00:38:25.225
to the countries that are most proximate where,

898
00:38:25.235 --> 00:38:25.824
you know, again,

899
00:38:25.834 --> 00:38:27.705
they may have family ties or just may feel

900
00:38:27.715 --> 00:38:29.725
more comfortable with that for them or whatever.

901
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.959
So it's, it's not true

902
00:38:32.229 --> 00:38:33.540
that if you, you know,

903
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.260
open things up that literally everyone in the world would want to come here.

904
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.520
That's just not the way it works.

905
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.199
So, you know, it's your point about like, oh,

906
00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:43.139
it's not fair that Iraqis can't come like, OK,

907
00:38:43.149 --> 00:38:44.600
so let's get them plane tickets but they,

908
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:45.899
-- but they
-- can't. That's my point.

909
00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:49.449
And look Gallup survey two tw 2021 900 million

910
00:38:49.459 --> 00:38:51.139
people would migrate to the west if they could.

911
00:38:51.149 --> 00:38:52.600
Sorry, that's just not gonna happen.

912
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:53.860
And this is the same thing again,

913
00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:58.520
I'm not arguing that we should just like let an unlimited number in.

914
00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.060
I just think the focus only on restriction is,

915
00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.929
and here's the other thing that I'll say is

916
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.760
there's this assumption

917
00:39:04.989 --> 00:39:08.729
that the more cruel and restrictive you are at the border.

918
00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:10.530
Number one, the more orderly it's gonna be,

919
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.949
that's not true because almost definition,

920
00:39:12.969 --> 00:39:16.455
the worry that you're squeezing the number of actual legal mi

921
00:39:16.594 --> 00:39:17.195
migrants,

922
00:39:17.205 --> 00:39:19.905
the more you're gonna have illegal migrants because these are not

923
00:39:19.915 --> 00:39:22.824
people who are like casually leaving their homes they have,

924
00:39:22.834 --> 00:39:23.104
you know,

925
00:39:23.114 --> 00:39:28.554
real reasons that are not gonna be mo and haven't shown uh any uh deterrence

926
00:39:28.594 --> 00:39:32.435
based on the cruelty at the border or the restrictionist policies at the border.

927
00:39:32.445 --> 00:39:33.895
I'll give you a perfect example

928
00:39:34.044 --> 00:39:36.264
after Trump instituted

929
00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:38.334
the child separation policy

930
00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:41.100
with these dramatically cruel images.

931
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:45.250
I mean, some of the most like cruel imagery you could possibly imagine coming out,

932
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.100
the number of migrants actually went up

933
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:53.239
there has been no evidence that the more you crack down at the border that it actually

934
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:56.050
serves as a deterrent effect and people don't come

935
00:39:56.139 --> 00:39:58.790
that simply has not worked out in history.

936
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.280
So even if your goal is like, let's keep people away,

937
00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:02.560
the restrictionist

938
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.110
-- isn't
-- effective for that.

939
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.510
The counter to that is that the reason

940
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.290
they started coming back is because Trump caved and

941
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.169
he actually went away from family separation and

942
00:40:09.179 --> 00:40:12.090
he basically reverted back to the original policy.

943
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.189
The one reason with the one time it worked was during

944
00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:16.479
the pandemic when we didn't allow people to cross illegally,

945
00:40:16.489 --> 00:40:16.929
period

946
00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.469
and you have to stay in Mexico, which I support that policy. If you

947
00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.090
didn't mean that people weren't coming,

948
00:40:22.389 --> 00:40:24.850
it just meant that they were being dealt with at a different point.

949
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:28.689
And I, you know, the remain in Mexico policy have some issues with.

950
00:40:28.699 --> 00:40:35.179
But the general principle of we should have structures and bureaucracy in place so

951
00:40:35.189 --> 00:40:38.580
that the whole of the issue isn't being dealt with at the border,

952
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:40.290
I do think actually makes sense.

953
00:40:40.669 --> 00:40:41.139
Yeah, I agree.

954
00:40:41.149 --> 00:40:44.489
Uh There's actually was a Trump policy at the time which Biden did away with,

955
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.939
which encouraged people to

956
00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.530
apply for asylum in their home country at the

957
00:40:48.637 --> 00:40:50.417
US Embassy if they wanted to.

958
00:40:50.427 --> 00:40:53.568
Unfortunately, that policy was done away with which I don't,

959
00:40:53.577 --> 00:40:59.018
-- there
-- was also a Biden policy that would use this CBP one APP or something like that,

960
00:40:59.028 --> 00:41:01.738
that would allow people to apply in their home countries,

961
00:41:01.748 --> 00:41:05.417
which also was incredibly effective and which Republicans have, you know,

962
00:41:05.427 --> 00:41:08.407
the one of the things that they're citing as a problem here is that it would

963
00:41:08.627 --> 00:41:10.167
enable that program to continue.

964
00:41:10.177 --> 00:41:12.337
-- I am not
-- saying the Republicans have been perfect on this issue.

965
00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:14.778
In fact, they've been complicit and in many cases

966
00:41:14.885 --> 00:41:17.486
uh have abetted this because it's good for big business.

967
00:41:17.496 --> 00:41:20.666
What's, you know, in terms of the wage theory? So that's what I would say.

968
00:41:20.676 --> 00:41:22.825
I am not a, you know, a Republican stand here,

969
00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:27.305
I'm purely representing the interests, I guess of uh Mr Saga and Jetty from my again,

970
00:41:27.315 --> 00:41:29.966
I think philosophical difference is that I think mass

971
00:41:30.236 --> 00:41:32.065
mass illegal migration is bad.

972
00:41:32.075 --> 00:41:35.216
I think mass migration net is also bad for the

973
00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.115
United States foreign born population is far too high.

974
00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:40.946
We need a long, long period of assimilation

975
00:41:41.134 --> 00:41:43.253
and have a strong social safety net policy.

976
00:41:43.323 --> 00:41:46.134
And I firmly believe that overall that this

977
00:41:46.144 --> 00:41:49.124
type of unmitigated control and all that actually does

978
00:41:49.134 --> 00:41:51.253
a great disservice to people like my family

979
00:41:51.263 --> 00:41:53.583
and others who came to the country legally.

980
00:41:53.593 --> 00:41:56.114
-- And it is an unfair policy. You
-- have the ability to

981
00:41:56.434 --> 00:41:57.424
and your family had the money

982
00:41:58.283 --> 00:41:59.033
and that's

983
00:41:59.533 --> 00:42:00.503
how is that fair?

984
00:42:00.733 --> 00:42:01.533
How is that fair though?

985
00:42:01.543 --> 00:42:04.204
Because you had the resources to do it and you happen to be from

986
00:42:04.214 --> 00:42:07.224
-- a country where there was a possibility of getting in that you're able
-- to,

987
00:42:07.382 --> 00:42:09.521
first of all, nobody owes anybody.

988
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:10.862
So in terms of policy,

989
00:42:10.872 --> 00:42:13.652
it makes sense that you probably want people who are higher skilled,

990
00:42:13.662 --> 00:42:16.382
who already speak English and who are well educated so they

991
00:42:16.392 --> 00:42:19.322
can more firmly and easily fit into the overall economy.

992
00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:19.731
That's

993
00:42:19.862 --> 00:42:20.112
number one.

994
00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:21.691
Well, but that's a difference.

995
00:42:21.701 --> 00:42:23.721
And then I don't think anybody has a right to come here.

996
00:42:23.731 --> 00:42:27.041
-- And in fact, my net is that nobody has a
-- right here. Here's what I would say.

997
00:42:27.372 --> 00:42:28.431
I do think

998
00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:30.672
mass illegal migration

999
00:42:31.072 --> 00:42:31.882
is a problem

1000
00:42:32.322 --> 00:42:33.521
not knowing who's coming in

1001
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.639
having chaos at the border, having people who are being paid under the table

1002
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.139
and who could, you know,

1003
00:42:39.149 --> 00:42:42.340
because they're working in the shadows that can depress wages.

1004
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.179
No doubt that that is, that is for sure an issue

1005
00:42:46.179 --> 00:42:47.520
having a, you know,

1006
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:52.060
significant level of legal migration where people have

1007
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.659
a path where you can put the requirement,

1008
00:42:53.669 --> 00:42:53.870
OK?

1009
00:42:53.879 --> 00:42:55.600
They, you have to speak English or whatever.

1010
00:42:55.979 --> 00:43:02.000
I think that is net and throughout history has shown to be net beneficial to America.

1011
00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.959
I think it's a core part of why America has been as, you know,

1012
00:43:05.969 --> 00:43:12.290
economically successful and as vibrant and thriving and innovative as it has been

1013
00:43:12.653 --> 00:43:17.512
around history. So I just, you know, and there isn't, isn't evidence

1014
00:43:17.802 --> 00:43:23.603
that legal immigrants negatively impact wages for anyone, as I said before.

1015
00:43:23.843 --> 00:43:29.673
So the, as a population, they tend to be um over overall more law abiding,

1016
00:43:29.683 --> 00:43:30.833
that's what the numbers show

1017
00:43:30.962 --> 00:43:34.153
tend to be some of the hardest working people in the entire country.

1018
00:43:34.252 --> 00:43:35.153
And actually, you know,

1019
00:43:35.163 --> 00:43:36.472
oftentimes tend to have a lot of

1020
00:43:36.482 --> 00:43:38.833
conservative values that Republicans are excited to,

1021
00:43:38.843 --> 00:43:42.595
-- you know, crow about and try to win over when it's convenient for them
-- politically.

1022
00:43:42.815 --> 00:43:44.016
No question, you're right.

1023
00:43:44.025 --> 00:43:45.775
I think immigration has obviously been a net

1024
00:43:45.785 --> 00:43:47.855
positive to America wouldn't be here without it

1025
00:43:47.986 --> 00:43:49.305
uh throughout the past in this.

1026
00:43:49.315 --> 00:43:50.615
But I would also, again,

1027
00:43:50.625 --> 00:43:53.256
I would say that periods of great migration

1028
00:43:53.266 --> 00:43:56.525
were also followed by periods of great shutdowns.

1029
00:43:56.535 --> 00:43:58.196
And I think there was deep wisdom

1030
00:43:58.345 --> 00:44:02.045
in that because it allowed for assimilation and allowed for the benefit

1031
00:44:02.055 --> 00:44:05.466
of that industrialization before we had overall changes to our laws,

1032
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:05.766
the Immigration

1033
00:44:06.009 --> 00:44:09.208
Naturalization Act of 1965 which by and large has

1034
00:44:09.218 --> 00:44:11.239
not changed and I think dramatically should change.

1035
00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:13.368
We currently have a chain migration based system where

1036
00:44:13.378 --> 00:44:14.489
if you happen to have a relative here,

1037
00:44:14.499 --> 00:44:15.249
it's easier to migrate,

1038
00:44:15.259 --> 00:44:18.789
which is nuts because it all should be mayor based which is what I support.

1039
00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:18.928
That's

1040
00:44:19.029 --> 00:44:19.049
n,

1041
00:44:19.499 --> 00:44:21.729
I think it makes sense that if you have that, I mean, the difference again,

1042
00:44:21.739 --> 00:44:23.878
like a tradition in America is if you know,

1043
00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:27.218
people who are in your family come and then they sort of set up and then you have some,

1044
00:44:27.229 --> 00:44:28.589
a support system that just because

1045
00:44:28.908 --> 00:44:29.499
t into,

1046
00:44:30.229 --> 00:44:32.118
but I think, I mean, to me it makes some sense.

1047
00:44:32.402 --> 00:44:32.941
Sure.

1048
00:44:32.951 --> 00:44:34.471
I mean, look, it has its proponents,

1049
00:44:34.481 --> 00:44:36.422
that's why it's been the law of the land for the last 50 years.

1050
00:44:36.431 --> 00:44:39.102
Uh What I would say is I think we should move like Australia,

1051
00:44:39.112 --> 00:44:41.471
Canada and many other Western developed countries to a

1052
00:44:41.481 --> 00:44:44.072
dramatically merit based immigration system with a point based

1053
00:44:44.082 --> 00:44:46.142
in terms of uh the criteria we've talked about

1054
00:44:46.152 --> 00:44:48.142
being able to speak English uh et cetera.

1055
00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:51.062
But that belies the fact that it's not going to be fair,

1056
00:44:51.072 --> 00:44:53.451
it's not fair because immigration shouldn't be fair.

1057
00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:56.602
Not everybody should have an equal right to immigrate or go anywhere and

1058
00:44:56.612 --> 00:44:58.572
I don't have an equal right to set foot in any country.

1059
00:44:58.582 --> 00:44:59.004
Whenever I

1060
00:44:59.175 --> 00:45:02.834
go through passport control, any country in the world can deny me if they want to, you

1061
00:45:02.965 --> 00:45:02.985
know,

1062
00:45:04.304 --> 00:45:04.395
the,

1063
00:45:05.445 --> 00:45:09.784
you know, the reality is because we are relatively well off and American,

1064
00:45:09.794 --> 00:45:11.965
we pretty much can go wherever we want,

1065
00:45:12.195 --> 00:45:14.034
we pretty much can go whatever we want.

1066
00:45:14.254 --> 00:45:17.074
So what you're advocating for is a policy where basically

1067
00:45:17.084 --> 00:45:19.905
like rich people can come and poor people can't.

1068
00:45:19.915 --> 00:45:22.284
And I, you know, even outside of the fair and I,

1069
00:45:22.294 --> 00:45:25.445
I don't actually think that that is the ideal migration

1070
00:45:25.709 --> 00:45:27.919
system because again, I think it's classes.

1071
00:45:27.929 --> 00:45:30.649
I think it ignores the, the skills and the abilities that, you know,

1072
00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:32.409
people who happen to have been born in the

1073
00:45:32.419 --> 00:45:34.889
wrong country and to the wrong set of parents

1074
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.050
that they can bring to the table. And I think that's demonstrated by the strength

1075
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.409
of America through migration throughout our history.

1076
00:45:42.419 --> 00:45:45.489
-- My
-- care for the poor and the lower class extends

1077
00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.929
to the borders of the United States for everybody.

1078
00:45:47.939 --> 00:45:51.750
Beyond that. II, I hope for the best for you, but it's not my problem.

1079
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.209
And uh that can sound harsh if you want.

1080
00:45:54.525 --> 00:45:58.125
But I've seen enough of the world to know that there is so much

1081
00:45:58.135 --> 00:46:02.476
suffering that is out there that there's absolutely nothing I can do about it.

1082
00:46:02.565 --> 00:46:06.186
My parents are from India. I feel no obligation to street urchins in India.

1083
00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:09.496
I think that's the Indian government's problem. I think it's really sad.

1084
00:46:09.506 --> 00:46:10.766
I've seen a lot of them, you know, in

1085
00:46:11.095 --> 00:46:13.166
horrible sanitary conditions,

1086
00:46:13.176 --> 00:46:17.696
but I believe that the number is so vast and so grand that there's a certain hubris

1087
00:46:17.716 --> 00:46:21.395
to the extent that we can think that we can extend those rights and benefits to.

1088
00:46:21.406 --> 00:46:22.815
And that's where you and I are just fundament

1089
00:46:23.062 --> 00:46:26.632
different because the fact that we can't solve every problem for every person in

1090
00:46:26.642 --> 00:46:32.041
the world does not harden my heart to being able to do what we can

1091
00:46:32.172 --> 00:46:37.072
within the bounds of things that again are actually good for our country

1092
00:46:37.082 --> 00:46:39.941
and have been shown to be good for our country over time.

1093
00:46:39.951 --> 00:46:41.582
And the last thing I'll just go back to,

1094
00:46:41.721 --> 00:46:46.181
it doesn't make any sense to me that when, uh, New Yorkers are fleeing to Texas.

1095
00:46:46.191 --> 00:46:51.362
Oh, my God. This is terrible for New York. But when migrants who again, over time

1096
00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.129
law abiding

1097
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.689
more law abiding than the native born population,

1098
00:46:55.949 --> 00:46:59.659
um hard working have gone through hell in order to get here

1099
00:46:59.669 --> 00:47:02.620
are gonna probably be way more patriotic than your average American.

1100
00:47:02.629 --> 00:47:03.429
But when they come,

1101
00:47:03.439 --> 00:47:05.939
suddenly it's a disaster and it's terrible if you say it doesn't make sense,

1102
00:47:05.949 --> 00:47:06.979
it just doesn't make sense to me.

1103
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:09.840
Well, public opinion doesn't agree with you. I can at least say that

1104
00:47:10.209 --> 00:47:10.729
about that.

1105
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.050
I think there are a lot of Americans who are very committed

1106
00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.110
to the basic concept of America as a nation of immigrants who,

1107
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.129
you know, I mean, this is

1108
00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:18.919
again,

1109
00:47:18.929 --> 00:47:23.229
Biden ran on this last time around and he won the presidency and I think it's been,

1110
00:47:23.239 --> 00:47:26.090
I think it's foolish for him to completely abandon

1111
00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.050
the more inclusive messaging, not, you know,

1112
00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.760
any sort of radical open borders thing,

1113
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:34.350
but the more inclusive messaging values based messaging

1114
00:47:34.399 --> 00:47:35.500
that helped him win the White House.

1115
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.080
I think it's a dramatic political mistake. We'll see.

1116
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.389
-- We've been
-- going for an hour, I believe so.

1117
00:47:39.399 --> 00:47:44.110
If people want to leave a comment and let us know, I hope that it was worth the

1118
00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:45.875
time. I think it was valuable.

1119
00:47:45.885 --> 00:47:48.354
I think people should be able to hear these different perspectives.

1120
00:47:48.364 --> 00:47:49.564
