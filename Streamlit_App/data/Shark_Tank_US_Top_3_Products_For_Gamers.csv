1,spk_1,0.31898333333333334,2.75615,"Hi. My name is Joe Croft. Im from San Clemente California and Im here asking for $750,000 in exchange for 5% of my company, Gunner Optics Sharks. We live in a world dominated by screens, phones, computers, tablets, P CS. Youre probably staring at a screen 6 to 8 hours a day. At the end of a long day. Your eyes might feel a little bit like this, like theyre covered in sand or perhaps theyre dry and irritated because they take a pounding or maybe youve got a burning sensation from all that harsh blue light or maybe you just have a headache that wont go away. Computer eye strain has become the number one health related office complaint in the United States outstripping carpal tunnel by 40 to 1. Now, all those screens arent going away anytime soon. So, whats the solution? Gunner optics that um I work for a digital age. Our patented optical technology is the only clinically proven solution for relieving all four major symptoms of computer eye strain. Gunner can help prevent dry eyes, reduce muscular, eye fatigue fight against glare and very importantly, scientifically proven to reduce that harmful blue light emitted from those screens by 65%. Using your eye wear, youll find an increase in optical clarity, focus and visual performance. So hopefully those long days at work dont feel quite so long. So sharks, lets make headaches and digital eye fatigue. A thing of the past in a world where screens are never more than a few feet away. The need to protect your eyes has never been so clear. So Ive got some samples here to pass out. Good. Lovely. Here you go. For name. There you go, sir. And for you. Thank you so much. Thank you Joe for you. Thank you very much. So, as you hold that out in the computer viewing distance, youll see that the contrast is enhanced. Theres a  feel your eyes relax, it
 blocks the blue light. Correct. Absolutely. In fact, weve scientifically measured it, we block 65% of the blue light thats emitted from all those screens."
2,spk_2,2.756333333333333,2.8644833333333333,"So yellow light is more calming and better for the eyes.  So theres
 a lot of science that goes into why yellow light is"

 business."
4,spk_0,3.0246500000000003,3.098316666666667,Tell us about your sales. Theres gonna be a lot of sales with the $16 million valuation.

 80?"

9,spk_1,3.5486500000000003,4.050333333333334,"we are going to build a brand. We have penetrated into the gaming category. I was thinking for gamers, this would be absolutely. Strength has been right. Gaming is where you basically deliver this with the gaming crowd. We sponsor a number of E sports athletes. E sports is the wild west right now. Do you have a patent? That is a great question because we not only have a patent, weve got battle tested. IP we have gone toe to toe with some of the largest people in the industry out there. Weve gone into the courtroom and come out victorious. Joe. Does that have to?"
10,spk_0,4.052316666666667,4.146166666666667,"Whats your experience in the eyewear business?  I
 spent a formative part of my career at Oakley, which as you guys probably know,"

 How much do you owe me personally? At 20%? Ok."
12,spk_0,4.3769833333333334,4.489983333333333," What happened to the
 wrist as you raise you dilute, youve had to continue to raise money.  That means something
 didnt work."
13,spk_1,4.490166666666667,4.640166666666667,"We really have only raised money in two large tranches. So we havent raised any money for the last several years. The company is profitable. Right. Ok. Well, good for you. Thats a good start."
14,spk_0,4.640333333333333,4.699166666666667," Absolutely. If you
 can give the numbers, it might help just rapidly."

What are you gonna use the money for marketing? Thats a key thing. We need to get the exposure out. We are evangelists about how bad peoples eyes are becoming. So then you must have debt. We do have debt, how much debt? 1.2. 0, wow."

We look at screens 24 hours a day, seven days a week for some of the biggest companies. In the world. No one has ever come to me and said my gosh, I need a pair of yellow glasses. Youve raised $9 million. Theres just a lot of uncertainty for me. Sorry, Im out. You deserve a lot of credit. A ton of credit because you are an eyewear industry. Survivor. Theres not a lot of those, but in looking for an investment, Im not looking for a Survivor. Im looking for a Thriver. Right.

Two, its much clearer and its almost like the letters get bigger and more defined. Very interesting to me because I have sold a product called Neo Neo Sunglasses. Ive sold probably $30 million worth of them. My concern here is that you have a lot of debt. You dont have a lot of equity. I see a solution. I see the solution is I do feel TV is what you need. You need the demonstration because once you look through them, youre sold, Im gonna give you a flyer, but its gonna be this, Im gonna give you 375 as an investment, 375 as a loan at 8% for 8%  and Ill try to blow it up for you.
 Thats a no brainer. That, that is amazing."

 over."

The omni can be played with any existing game that uses keyboard input. Once youre in the omni, you can put on the virtual reality glasses. Oh Cool. This is right up your alley. The OMNI enables you to walk, run, jump and crouch in 360 degrees and put your mind and your body into the video game to transport you into a different world. Cool. Wow. Virtual reality hasnt ever broken through because the technology wasnt ready. Thats all changing. Now, the technology is here. The omni is here.

78,spk_0,22.79315,24.721,"People would like to be fit, but gamers, they dont like to exercise. We can play games and lose weight and burn calories at the same time. People are excited about it. Theres a weight loss machine as well. Is that what youre thinking? Absolutely. But theres a bigger issue, right? This is pretty much based around Oculus Rift, right? As Oculus Rift goes, you guys go, can you tell me what that is Oculus Rift? Thats the headset. The rift is basically what started this virtual reality revolution. Theyve done a phenomenal job of allowing you to put on a headset and be in an immersive world. Is that included in the price? Its not included in the price for that $300. Is the gun included? The gun is off the shelf, you can buy it online. It sounds like its gonna be an 8 to $900 cost, which is quite a bit. Why dont you tell us why youre worth $20 million today? I mean, no ones addressed that. I think its the elephant in the room. Thats a ridiculous valuation for this. Let me walk you through the numbers. The rift is an analog for our product. Same target market, same people. Theyre selling 200 of these per day right now. Their projects to do 500,000 units in sales next year. If we convert one out of 20 buyers of the rift, well, we will be selling 25,000 units next year, which is $12.5 million sales. Theres a fundamental difference though, when I buy the headgear, I can still sit around and lounge. Youre forcing me to stand and youre forcing me to be interactive. I dont think people want to be that interactive. I sold three times on the number just without a product. We can debate the merits of the product. Im just trying to look at the sheer number. You want me to pay your value two years from now. Today, heres my thinking on it. If my husband brought this into my house, I would divorce him immediately. I think its a problem because of its size in the home. I also think its a tremendous problem to sell this in retail. I sell a lot of product now through retail, I couldnt get anybody to give the floor space to this. Youd pay so much just to demonstrate it. But I think thats a concern. You have to realize that 50% of the population is married and theyre gonna have to deal with their wife on this one. So Im out,"
79,spk_3,24.77065,25.035833333333336,"you know, I see the market, you know, Black Ops did amazing Grand Theft Auto. Right. Breaking records. I, I see the market but I also dont see somebody playing this more than an hour or half an hour a day before. They cant even play anymore because theyre out of breath or theyre tired, they just wont revisit it. So for all those reasons and more, Im out,"
80,spk_0,25.067,27.131149999999998,"look great product. I will definitely buy one. But I think Im an anomaly. You better talk to your wife. Shes not a pushover. Well, we have a big house barber. Shell never see it. But I dont think that people want to exercise and immerse themselves in the fiscal world to that degree. I think if people really want to immerse themselves that way, I think theyll go outside. I, I dont buy the premise. Im out. I see you going with it, but it is a sub segment of a subsegment market and its very expensive. I look at it and say to myself, is this a good deal of $20 million where you are right now? And the answer is no, its not. Theres too much risk between your delivery of a consumer product, a retail distribution strategy and your sales, youve got tons of risk, all kinds of risk. And I gotta pay tomorrows price today. I hate deals like that. I hate it when you make me pay for two years from now. If everything works today, why would I do that? Im not an idiot. Why would I do that because of the potential youre going to have problems. T, is gonna happen. My friend and I have to pay for that now. No, its an outrage ridiculous. Im out. I get what youre doing. I could see you creating 20 million in sales, 25 million in sales with this. But youre competing just like headsets are gonna be competing just like the um consoles are gonna be competing. Youre one more, one more outlet competing for consumer dollars, you have to push that ball so hard to keep going. If you havent told me that theres a way to get to 50 million in sales and in six years, theres gonna be completely new technology that blows all this away for those reasons. Im out. Thank you. Thanks guys. You know, I look at the experience and what can people learn from what happened here today? And for me, the lesson is very interesting. Ip, way overpriced. If you had put this at a 5 million valuation, it would have been very interesting. Good luck. Thank you, John. Anybody who pays 20 million for that. Is insane. Gamers are lazy. Like most human beings, they dont want to exercise, they dont."
