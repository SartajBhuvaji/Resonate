Theres not that many set up A DS left other than Gin. So hes gonna have to dig deep deft. Isnt that much of an Aels player?

 right,"

Normally you want the support to be able to protect, be able to keep him safe. But there it is counter pick into the eight track. The yone locked in for T one. Granata Glass going to be the last champion here in the first half for them."

Meanwhile, Kia has one series entire series for T one with this Renato pick really, really great ultimates coming from him to bring that structure to their team fights and theres the stylist baby. I wanted it for Zecca. He throws it down versus Faker the God and then you can protection ban it here in the next two bands.  Really nice stuff from DRX. See
 the rise minority coming through."

Now, the question is Jungle Pool is slightly pinched here. A little bit too. Four owner said you want and Graves being down Diego being picked away. What is his option for the draft might go for, at least in by the looks of it. A lot of meat champs so can find those kicks."

So I think something that can either go in or something that can set up. Pushing lane is all the DRX deep here in the both side sever is gonna be the answer a bit short ranged against the Azer, but def confident enough that that champion can get the push and keep the push in the mid game."

 plays to worlds finals."

And especially considering the squishing nature of both compositions. I like this purchase from Baker"

 the big thing Im looking at is we have solo laner"

Im expecting to start seeing some dives and a little bit of testing the water to see if they can just skill check their opponents."
77,spk_1,20.517783333333334,20.889566666666667,"And one of the ones who can pull the trigger first, they have that Herald, they probably want to put it towards mid or 12. I mean, every single tower is incredibly low. Theyre having push in all of these three lanes which allows them to control this map. So well, grouping up now trying to find an avenue to get a little bit of vision. Maybe they can look for a pick carry is still not having that flash up. Theres a ward around it, but owner is ready to cover.  Yeah, I
 think their biggest advantage they could set up for themselves here."

Heimerdinger does so well though this pick that has been so fun throughout world when your opponents have to come face, check you into brush and thats what barrel is trying to accomplish."

 is the, the severe,"

 especially love the story. Well, never mind owners on. We dont have time for stories. Owner looking for another finds, the R finds the Q finds two. There it is. Owner picks up the K.  The

105,spk_1,28.5791,28.90328333333333,"They need a couple more items, spikes. You can see King has just picked up the death stents, but its infinity edge on death. The three items sever that DRX need to look towards double 14 right now, actually ahead of gays in terms of level. So the sever will keep the wave clear going on the top and mid inhibitor. T one needs to stop pressuring the map a little bit harder, put their foot on the gas and look for this bolt tier too.  Yeah, from
 T ones first,"
106,spk_0,28.911966666666668,29.08795,"there is one lane to go to with super going in both mid and top lane, just group up on bottom side, pressure it in continue to take objectives. Dont let DRX farm comfortably."

 wolf and thats very important."

109,spk_1,29.604966666666666,29.88665,"And I think seizing that ball tier three for the final inhibitor is going to be a bit tough for T one at the moment. One minute, 30 seconds, like you said, flowers on that Baron, thats gonna be the next threat for T one. A little bit of top side vision. Keep that mid push have Zeus on a side lane perhaps depending on his team  timer and then look to force that Baron force DRX to walk
 into you."

This is their hope. The siver late game farming trying to annihilate these minion waves, see if they can pull out a team fight. Meanwhile, big objective is to keep vision control over your red quadrant of your jungle. So that you dont get into very dangerous  scenarios. It comes up in only 57
 seconds. Im trying to deny that red buff there."

 T one."

Zeus already has been allocated up to that top lane. Push it in this yone. So oppressive DRX is gonna have to fight on all sides right now."

Three men, bottom one men in each other lane say is leading the charge to that exposed inhibitor in top Baker, maintaining pressure in mid Ka has got all the push power in the world here in bottom last standing inhibitor turret. That one is going to fall can just go ahead clear that out. No problem taking out the other inhibitor there in top lane two more Os will do it. Hell just let the minions take it out. Triple in his game for T one."

Are they gonna run down towards this dragon pit and fight it or theyre just gonna give everything up? Guma Yushi even tried to use the old unto death spell shield came through. And even with that ultimate down, DRX didnt feel confident enough to find an engage."

123,spk_2,33.496,33.99861666666666,"Well, there is also less than one minute remaining until Baron spawns again. If t one want to play this as safely and as shortly as possible, they will make their way over to that pit, they will secure that objective and then they will push for the win.
