00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.710
Israel. We've seen it before with different a carries the

1
00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:06.679
instant locked here though, four T one right out of the gate. Guma

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.069
has performed so well on this champion.

3
00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.840
I wonder if you'll see something like Tristan here from def.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.989
I mean, the ad pool is really pinched at the moment.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.309
There's not that many set up A DS left other than Gin.

6
00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:18.870
So he's gonna have to dig deep deft. Isn't that much of an

7
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.649
Aels player?

8
00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.469
We saw his third Draven game all time in this tournament when they were down two nil.

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.430
Uh, there's the A trucks coming in for King and Z was probably gonna go something like

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.850
fra

11
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.409
the

12
00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:33.268
trucks has been a staple of top lane throughout this entire tournament.

13
00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:37.068
-- I
-- think they also have a high priority on this silence that has gone

14
00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:40.597
through when you ban out the call for one side here for 41.

15
00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:42.147
Also raising that priority

16
00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:43.967
-- has been a monster
-- with it.

17
00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:44.198
Yeah,

18
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.787
I think the problem they run into with blinding

19
00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:48.478
Silas is they're going to face against fakers rise.

20
00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:51.318
I wonder if faker will blind, pick it regardless. But there's the

21
00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:52.158
VGO coming in from

22
00:00:52.647 --> 00:00:56.048
graves is still up as well. So I wonder if owner wants to go in that direction.

23
00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.018
-- All
-- right,

24
00:00:57.245 --> 00:00:59.855
one second part of the draft for him.

25
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.875
Let's see what it's going to be to accompany that forest.

26
00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:05.055
Remember this 80 carry is typically very vulnerable.

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:09.185
Normally you want the support to be able to protect, be able to keep him safe.

28
00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:10.625
But there it is

29
00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:13.466
counter pick into the eight track.

30
00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:13.916
The yone

31
00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:16.045
locked in for T one.

32
00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:19.146
Granata Glass going to be the last champion here in the first half for them.

33
00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:25.776
The mechanics on this top lane prodigy, get everyone excited for this pick.

34
00:01:25.863 --> 00:01:26.444
Meanwhile,

35
00:01:26.804 --> 00:01:31.704
Kia has one series entire series for T one with this Renato pick really,

36
00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:34.344
really great ultimates coming from him to bring that structure

37
00:01:34.353 --> 00:01:37.884
to their team fights and there's the stylist baby.

38
00:01:37.893 --> 00:01:38.994
I wanted it for

39
00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:39.503
Zecca.

40
00:01:39.513 --> 00:01:44.624
He throws it down versus Faker the God and then you

41
00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:47.924
can protection ban it here in the next two bands.

42
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.223
-- Really nice stuff from DRX. See
-- the rise minority coming through.

43
00:01:51.234 --> 00:01:54.374
You think of Azier, you think of Victor as the last two remaining champions

44
00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:56.991
of control majors that can go into the silo. But like you said,

45
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:57.262
you

46
00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:58.921
know, such a powerhouse pick for

47
00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.671
Zeus and it was virus that

48
00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:03.522
carrier was alongside in that buffle match up to dominate the league.

49
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:06.012
Yeah, we got the rise band away the RB

50
00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:11.781
out by T one respecting Beryl's wide champion pool. There's the graves band out.

51
00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:15.061
Recognizing that T one still has that jungle roll yet to pick.

52
00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.022
They do not want to deal with the graves there. With that

53
00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:18.352
VGO matchup era

54
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.561
will be the final band of the draft for one

55
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:22.061
and the

56
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.350
-- locked in in game one for DRX
-- Farrel Heimerdinger

57
00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.250
shows its face again.

58
00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.240
We've seen time and time again that he doesn't need an ash by his side.

59
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.009
We've seen Ezra Heimerdinger come out from DRX.

60
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.729
Now, the question is Jungle Pool is slightly pinched here. A little bit too.

61
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.119
Four owner said you want and Graves being down Diego being picked away.

62
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.610
What is his option for the draft

63
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.750
might go for, at least in by the looks of it.

64
00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.970
A lot of meat champs so can find those kicks.

65
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.190
-- You'll love to
-- see it.

66
00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:57.360
The style always possible to come out there with the Lee Sid and Baker. Baker Baker.

67
00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.820
What's a good

68
00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.449
beer

69
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.539
comes down again now? Ok.

70
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.169
So a Carey here, I think misfortune for de if you go by what has been most played,

71
00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.699
but do they have something secret?

72
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.619
-- That's
-- a good question. You think of misfortune

73
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.470
of Jane Callista is up but Calista Heimer

74
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.699
doesn't sound the strongest

75
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.960
seger.

76
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.979
Heer. Maybe not the best up against Az with the long range.

77
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.940
So I think something that can either go in or something that can set up.

78
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.320
Pushing lane is all the DRX deep here in the both side sever

79
00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.789
is gonna be the answer a bit short ranged against the Azer,

80
00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.639
but def confident enough that that champion can get the

81
00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.690
push and keep the push in the mid game.

82
00:03:28.783 --> 00:03:29.772
When you're thinking of push,

83
00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:31.843
when you're thinking of 80 carry siver is always

84
00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:34.682
the one that first comes to mind for me,

85
00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:38.542
especially when you have these solo laner that have the capability of

86
00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:41.462
being a side lane threat of being a one V one monster

87
00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:43.432
-- siver to clear the waves.
-- Feels great.

88
00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:46.132
Do you know what's beautiful about these two cups? There's no front line.

89
00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:49.613
This is all just an Armageddon in team five.

90
00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:53.602
If anyone can connect spell spells, there is so much follow up from both sides,

91
00:03:53.613 --> 00:03:54.822
especially on T one.

92
00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:57.822
The front line is your ability to outplay. That's it.

93
00:03:57.832 --> 00:03:59.865
-- It's not the health bar is your
-- mechanics,

94
00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:03.735
which puts a lot more emphasis on these key big abilities you mentioned

95
00:04:03.856 --> 00:04:05.776
as soon as carry are locked in the Renata,

96
00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:08.195
that's something that can bring some structure to your team fight.

97
00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.436
If you get locked up in just a moment of CC,

98
00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:14.865
there's so much damage on both of these teams boom, instantly taken down.

99
00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:17.786
-- So so much is gonna come down to
-- execution.

100
00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:20.745
There is a lot of damage and I think both compositions

101
00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:24.305
diving into the opposing team's composition just looks really tricky. Right?

102
00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:24.865
Renata

103
00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:27.605
A here in terms of push back and host style take over the Heri

104
00:04:28.058 --> 00:04:28.628
committing to

105
00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:29.968
a Hegg receiver seems tough

106
00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:32.979
-- of the
-- current meta of that melee match up with th

107
00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.609
with the call taking turns.

108
00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.729
Here we go. Then on to sum of his R for game one of the world's finals.

109
00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:47.438
It's been 3000, 318 days since Faker won his first world championship.

110
00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:51.729
1000 and 50 games, 100 and 90 patches. And he's looking for another.

111
00:04:51.739 --> 00:04:55.269
-- It's
-- been a damn long time but they're back here and ready to go.

112
00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:57.269
The arena is packed, the

113
00:04:57.411 --> 00:05:03.582
players are locked and loaded and T one and DRX are ready for their first conflict.

114
00:05:03.592 --> 00:05:05.962
What an epic finals here.

115
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:09.832
Everyone waiting on the edge of their seats for the

116
00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:13.152
greatest organization in the history of League of legends.

117
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:16.992
T one and Baker versus DRX,

118
00:05:17.002 --> 00:05:23.261
-- the greatest underdog run in the world's history
-- plays to world's finals.

119
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:26.381
They've just been scaling throughout the entire tournament death

120
00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:28.614
taking down so many of his former teammates,

121
00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:30.885
DRX finding ways to topple

122
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:32.295
teams like EDG

123
00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:33.415
and now

124
00:05:33.575 --> 00:05:36.095
just a very standard level one here. A ward there

125
00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:37.945
in the river. The pink place by

126
00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:39.295
PIC goes for the

127
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.114
normal health ball just gives a little bit of vision to

128
00:05:41.255 --> 00:05:42.975
Zecca to make sure he's safe in the early stages.

129
00:05:43.024 --> 00:05:45.654
And definitely looking at juggler's both starting bottom sides

130
00:05:45.665 --> 00:05:48.184
because the top lane matchup is so volatile.

131
00:05:48.834 --> 00:05:52.015
Zeus is one of the few top laner that people have confidence to pick these sort

132
00:05:52.024 --> 00:05:56.415
of skill matchups into with that Yoni on the top side and we want to see if

133
00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.678
or owner will get there first to influence it. It

134
00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:01.958
really snowball and damage the m

135
00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:03.708
way of control afterwards.

136
00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:04.217
All right,

137
00:06:04.798 --> 00:06:05.697
go ahead. Clear out that

138
00:06:05.977 --> 00:06:06.467
second.

139
00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:08.907
Just go ahead and make sure he's maximizing that exp

140
00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.488
just going to continue passing towards that top side.

141
00:06:11.497 --> 00:06:12.868
I would believe Baker versus

142
00:06:13.317 --> 00:06:13.437
Zeca.

143
00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:15.398
There's going to be a lot of conversations about

144
00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:17.548
this matchup throughout the entirety of the series.

145
00:06:17.558 --> 00:06:20.287
I guarantee it Tri Lane shot showing us the,

146
00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:22.678
has that push here in the top lane.

147
00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:25.717
Meanwhile bottom side DRX taking early command of the

148
00:06:26.281 --> 00:06:29.821
definitely is and of course, T one is eight and zero against DRX this year.

149
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.860
The Rx haven't even taken a single game in the

150
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:34.020
best of threes and every single time in those games,

151
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.881
T one have had responses to what the Rx have blind picked.

152
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.501
You know, you think back to even in spring round one, they played three De

153
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.670
Me

154
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.520
in the court. He Becks into a eve

155
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:42.110
going to r

156
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:44.240
so many examples. But Pio

157
00:06:44.531 --> 00:06:46.851
is now looking around mid, he's done his three B side tap

158
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.001
looking for faker.

159
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:50.281
-- He might have to flash the
-- stunt

160
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:50.790
Yoshi

161
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.490
coming in with spectrum. More faker gets away nicely flashed from that.

162
00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:57.674
And as we have a little bit of early action here,

163
00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.574
remember the prime gaming is giving away 150,000 RP

164
00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:03.433
to several lucky fans every single day of this competition

165
00:07:03.574 --> 00:07:04.533
and we're almost done.

166
00:07:04.544 --> 00:07:04.623
So,

167
00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:07.373
head on over to prime Gaming World 20 two.com to enter

168
00:07:07.384 --> 00:07:09.463
and make sure you put in today's secret code to get those

169
00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:11.653
inches. I love this early pass from PIC

170
00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:14.223
because it doesn't take much of his time at all.

171
00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:15.854
I think it's a very valuable summer spell

172
00:07:16.074 --> 00:07:16.614
owner now,

173
00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:18.283
walking over the ward that he left

174
00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:21.553
behind really good manipulation of information here.

175
00:07:21.563 --> 00:07:24.144
Red Buff is going to be pulled off since they saw him on the ward

176
00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:24.944
knows that

177
00:07:25.127 --> 00:07:27.196
was on the way. Might have to reset the red buff here in K

178
00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:27.486
is Soto

179
00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:30.576
lane, don't really have any push. So owner is just going to go over to the crux instead

180
00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:33.986
kick very aware of that happening. So he's going to try to push him back as well.

181
00:07:33.997 --> 00:07:36.397
Doesn't want to give up any of these camp owner wants to keep the pressure. Zeus

182
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:37.076
is first to the

183
00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:37.726
one

184
00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:40.627
nicely done owner faster on the Smite.

185
00:07:40.957 --> 00:07:41.006
Yoshi's

186
00:07:41.226 --> 00:07:42.356
gonna have to walk away. Now,

187
00:07:42.527 --> 00:07:46.117
Zus commanding control over the wave crashing into the turret means he can back up

188
00:07:46.127 --> 00:07:49.647
his jungler so owner can stick around and secure more of the smaller CRS.

189
00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:50.837
-- And
-- actually it was P

190
00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:54.576
who used the Smite and owner got it with a little bit of damage there. So now

191
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.019
has slight advantage for a little bit over P

192
00:07:57.829 --> 00:07:58.929
and he's got a ward on the red.

193
00:07:59.079 --> 00:07:59.790
-- He could just steal
-- this.

194
00:08:00.059 --> 00:08:01.190
That ward is perfect.

195
00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:04.839
He's scared of owner and he will spot him out on the way.

196
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.700
He's going to try to reset it again. You have to imagine no push in mid lane for

197
00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:09.250
it in the

198
00:08:10.059 --> 00:08:13.059
-- looks like you'll be able to finish it out of vision. Nicely
-- done.

199
00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:17.230
Right back in on the other side of the red to prevent any further patience loss.

200
00:08:17.239 --> 00:08:18.809
He doesn't even have to smite it anymore.

201
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.290
They see owner on top of the ward, they know he's no longer contesting this,

202
00:08:22.299 --> 00:08:23.890
but he is still looking into the

203
00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:25.863
just going to back out.

204
00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.192
-- There's nothing left to fight for you and this
-- is the trade off of the mid.

205
00:08:28.442 --> 00:08:29.472
You got a flash. You lost

206
00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:29.983
Prus.

207
00:08:30.102 --> 00:08:32.942
Not the end of the world did pick up a couple of them and managed to get his red.

208
00:08:32.953 --> 00:08:34.072
Now he's going to move down towards his B

209
00:08:34.182 --> 00:08:34.513
crab.

210
00:08:34.842 --> 00:08:35.312
Second

211
00:08:35.562 --> 00:08:36.592
ones coming in.

212
00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.013
No pressure a lot here for faker in mid

213
00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:40.871
as the TB if he needs it,

214
00:08:40.972 --> 00:08:41.043
jos

215
00:08:41.222 --> 00:08:42.881
has flash to gap close on the faker.

216
00:08:42.893 --> 00:08:44.773
Baker might have to be careful in the next couple of minutes.

217
00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:49.742
-- Not
-- a lot of man to work with here on SECA with the Silas. He's playing nice and safe.

218
00:08:49.793 --> 00:08:50.572
We'll see if he

219
00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:53.413
can find an angle here. Baker still pretty far

220
00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.090
back to

221
00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:57.780
over

222
00:08:57.909 --> 00:08:57.929
to

223
00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.940
-- the star here
-- funneled again. P OI

224
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.440
multiple games returns before the flash gets back

225
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.510
up as you said instantly flashes in there for

226
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.710
the ST they get their kill and they get the money exactly where they want it.

227
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.809
This silent skills so well and can have some kill pressure.

228
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.380
-- This
-- is gonna be a huge problem for

229
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:19.669
one in the mid game

230
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.590
was forced to flash away the solo lanes going in favor of DRX. It's King and

231
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:24.729
Pio

232
00:09:25.239 --> 00:09:25.479
off to

233
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.067
a great start.

234
00:09:26.077 --> 00:09:29.606
These two players were last place in the LCK last year in summer and

235
00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:32.036
-- now they're in the world's finals and they're already off to a great
-- start.

236
00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:33.976
And I love their story with King in

237
00:09:34.236 --> 00:09:36.916
-- and Decca as we have it after hit our bottom side
-- boys,

238
00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:40.086
we might not have the time for any story because De

239
00:09:40.396 --> 00:09:42.947
is about to drop in bottom lane but he heals through it

240
00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:46.377
here. He is owner still chasing after owner wants to land it.

241
00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:48.267
There's a little bit more damage coming up

242
00:09:48.387 --> 00:09:48.427
on

243
00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:48.567
a

244
00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.656
flash into the tempest

245
00:09:50.796 --> 00:09:51.507
to make it

246
00:09:52.077 --> 00:09:52.356
as

247
00:09:52.677 --> 00:09:53.666
Deca goes in with a stolen,

248
00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:57.434
he'll shuffle faker right on back. But owner on the way, so

249
00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:00.883
-- Zeca can't do more beautiful
-- play there from owner and carrier

250
00:10:01.013 --> 00:10:04.004
chasing down on bottom side and because they get De down,

251
00:10:04.013 --> 00:10:05.903
they get supremacy over the river

252
00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:06.754
knowing that

253
00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:11.744
Zeca cannot chase Baker any further into it. What an explosive start

254
00:10:12.203 --> 00:10:12.924
barrel just gonna help

255
00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:15.744
Seca get a little bit of vision around mid there did get the first base off as Cara

256
00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:18.734
was looking to that, a lot of Sumner is blown across the board.

257
00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:20.823
Zeca ideally wants to crash his wave in.

258
00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:22.593
Doesn't have the flash and faker has to shuffle,

259
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.260
needs to respect it and back away a lot of early action.

260
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:30.440
Yeah, Baker's still having that shuffle because remember he was level five when DEA

261
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.460
engaged on him with a stolen alti. Let's now take another look at what happened.

262
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:35.000
Bottom

263
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.520
Kia nicely done there using E to pop the shield.

264
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:41.301
-- But for the
-- handshake gets the shield off and then pulls depth back in.

265
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.531
Want to just make sure the wave crashed there at Detton Kia

266
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.091
stopped him in his tracks.

267
00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:48.651
His former teammate almost managed to find the solo kill an owner right behind. Ka.

268
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.080
Make sure he's there to back him up. E flash comes in

269
00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:56.719
-- double flash expected for that kill. Cara
-- is so good, so incredibly good.

270
00:10:56.729 --> 00:11:02.309
This support prodigy from rank one actually started with death on DRX as well,

271
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.469
getting the kill there.

272
00:11:03.479 --> 00:11:05.229
But now it's dragon started up for

273
00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:08.250
Pic and DRX and they should be able to finish it. No, Leon

274
00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:10.570
arounds means no attempt at a sm

275
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.299
steal.

276
00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:13.419
When

277
00:11:14.659 --> 00:11:14.770
you

278
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.090
got

279
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:15.260
an

280
00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:15.909
arrow,

281
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:17.700
Kahi kick

282
00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:19.239
bull's eye for Guus.

283
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.039
She picks up the dragon

284
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.640
pusic doesn't even use the Smite,

285
00:11:23.799 --> 00:11:25.830
oldest blood pressure for DRX and then

286
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.849
Psic coming down having the mid push and

287
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:32.890
-- th up that Drake backfires. And
-- this just reminds you of how T one got here to finals.

288
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.729
It was bottom different.

289
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.039
Oh,

290
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.929
my goodness. Cara takes down death. Then immediately afterwards,

291
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.320
Goma

292
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:43.090
is able to snipe away the objective as well.

293
00:11:43.099 --> 00:11:46.299
This t one bottom lane is the T one bottom

294
00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:50.309
lane that was promised originally best in the world,

295
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:50.750
right?

296
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.349
These guys stumbled at M si after an incredible, incredible run in spring in summer.

297
00:11:57.359 --> 00:11:58.549
It's been about recovery.

298
00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:02.950
And when I look back at their semifinal, they played this past weekend against JDG.

299
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.719
It was the bot

300
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.039
D

301
00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:05.590
-- that really
-- stood out. It really was

302
00:12:05.768 --> 00:12:07.098
an owner is hovering around there now,

303
00:12:07.109 --> 00:12:09.028
making sure they have some kind of vision to push out.

304
00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:12.539
De with no flash is an easy set up with a level six lease in owner just

305
00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:14.398
trying to juggle this Midden bolt push to make

306
00:12:14.408 --> 00:12:15.869
sure they can control this bolt side river.

307
00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:18.869
But with Harold up, Ken's gonna stop that one top push

308
00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:21.359
in favor of the Rx. They use no flash

309
00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:24.309
deca is ready to move across. Beryl is on his way up.

310
00:12:24.318 --> 00:12:27.848
We'll be first to the top side river. How does he want to dissect this fight?

311
00:12:27.859 --> 00:12:28.789
They're looking for Kingen

312
00:12:29.018 --> 00:12:31.169
owner throws out the cue but he's not gonna find it.

313
00:12:31.648 --> 00:12:34.328
Zaka jumps in. Owner's ready to retreat back to his own teammate,

314
00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:35.499
say who's contesting

315
00:12:35.638 --> 00:12:36.607
1 ft? Two

316
00:12:36.848 --> 00:12:39.867
owner and faker ready to join in. But barrels made his way into the fight.

317
00:12:39.877 --> 00:12:43.388
Owner jumps in it's secured by DRX, now the fight breaks out p

318
00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:43.768
coming

319
00:12:43.978 --> 00:12:45.627
right back in T one with a lot of

320
00:12:45.788 --> 00:12:46.177
move.

321
00:12:46.427 --> 00:12:46.468
SECA

322
00:12:46.817 --> 00:12:49.357
tries to get the kill but he won't feel secure

323
00:12:50.377 --> 00:12:55.987
charges forward but not finding another kill just yet. It is t one.

324
00:12:55.997 --> 00:13:00.747
-- They lose the objective. They get the kill and they stop the eye from being picked
-- up.

325
00:13:00.757 --> 00:13:05.458
Yep. There. Smite was a little bit early. 95. He left on that Riff.

326
00:13:05.817 --> 00:13:10.937
So DRX, they get the 300 gold for getting the rip held. But Baker sweeps in the Azer

327
00:13:11.137 --> 00:13:14.526
Sweet back allows them to pick up the kill and owner surviving

328
00:13:14.536 --> 00:13:17.346
there on the backside also means they get priority on the map.

329
00:13:17.356 --> 00:13:19.846
So they're able to deny that eyeball you're talking about

330
00:13:19.856 --> 00:13:22.296
as well as Baker getting an extra turret play.

331
00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:26.197
-- So
-- let's look at that again. Goes in with a Q 295 HP and then

332
00:13:26.497 --> 00:13:27.267
Pic picks it up and Zeus

333
00:13:27.526 --> 00:13:28.536
who gets the knock up on the p

334
00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:30.187
the shuffle into the Zeus

335
00:13:30.456 --> 00:13:31.877
actually catches three of the mere

336
00:13:32.086 --> 00:13:34.267
off level six. So he can't put down the big TZ

337
00:13:34.437 --> 00:13:35.396
confident enough to chase.

338
00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:36.435
And like you said, hi

339
00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:40.916
to T one pushing lanes for T one with plates means it's in their favor this play.

340
00:13:41.166 --> 00:13:45.815
-- I
-- love the fact that we got to fight that big early on in game one.

341
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:48.226
It bodes very well for the series.

342
00:13:48.236 --> 00:13:52.776
T one up about 700 goals now just shy of 10 minutes into the game,

343
00:13:52.786 --> 00:13:54.036
they've got a 1 to 0 lead.

344
00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:55.825
They've got that stolen Drake,

345
00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:59.085
but we're probably not going to see any more big fights for another two minutes

346
00:13:59.096 --> 00:14:03.096
until the next Drake spawns total goal on the left side of your screen.

347
00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:03.416
It's

348
00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:04.315
Zeca and Guus

349
00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:05.335
pulling

350
00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:06.434
and car

351
00:14:06.734 --> 00:14:08.255
man in the last fight as well,

352
00:14:08.265 --> 00:14:13.275
sniping him again with another handshake to push them together to set up that kill,

353
00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:18.025
getting a last hit for himself as well will be a fairly rich Granada.

354
00:14:18.034 --> 00:14:21.284
-- But river control goes over to DRX and they secure
-- the crab. So

355
00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:21.554
B

356
00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:21.815
push

357
00:14:22.054 --> 00:14:22.794
for DRX

358
00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:24.034
Kings Wing in isolation and Z

359
00:14:24.255 --> 00:14:26.344
needs some kind of vision to threaten faker to

360
00:14:26.354 --> 00:14:28.164
make sure that he can't push into his power,

361
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.094
keep him under his power.

362
00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:29.984
That has that lo

363
00:14:30.145 --> 00:14:32.705
th threat of the second. He lands a chain, he can push him back into Pio.

364
00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:33.775
It's all about the mid B

365
00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:35.195
side here for both these teams and

366
00:14:35.364 --> 00:14:36.124
saw the way that

367
00:14:36.263 --> 00:14:40.523
could just use the spells throwing out the E two following it immediately with the R.

368
00:14:40.533 --> 00:14:41.994
If that E two connects, boom,

369
00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:45.484
you just shuffle them right back into the lane as we pan back top side and

370
00:14:45.783 --> 00:14:48.693
is still in control. Owner coming up through the crushes.

371
00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:49.073
Yeah.

372
00:14:49.193 --> 00:14:52.033
With all the focus on the other side, with these little skirmishes

373
00:14:52.354 --> 00:14:53.703
has been able to get himself thats

374
00:14:53.914 --> 00:14:54.294
lead

375
00:14:54.434 --> 00:14:55.013
with his yone

376
00:14:55.193 --> 00:14:58.104
counter pick and owner does have flash and le

377
00:14:58.403 --> 00:15:00.403
and kick available, they're going to look for the knock up.

378
00:15:00.414 --> 00:15:01.883
I wonder if they can execute. This dive

379
00:15:02.114 --> 00:15:05.104
has TV. So the longer this play goes on, the more it will backfire. I think

380
00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:05.713
the king

381
00:15:05.882 --> 00:15:06.853
and takes a trade into Zeus

382
00:15:07.103 --> 00:15:10.593
and looks for a kill king and showing a lot of respect. So no play to be made.

383
00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:11.203
Their owner,

384
00:15:11.862 --> 00:15:14.442
one could have broken the entire game open by getting that kill Heralding.

385
00:15:14.453 --> 00:15:15.172
The top tower Zeus

386
00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:16.482
will be unlocked on the map but

387
00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:17.752
is going to be back mid

388
00:15:18.232 --> 00:15:18.862
the testing his way

389
00:15:19.013 --> 00:15:20.882
-- and you can
-- see the timing for owner.

390
00:15:20.893 --> 00:15:22.822
He doesn't want to waste any further seconds

391
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:24.822
on top side because dragon is responding.

392
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:28.043
So they set themselves up for that possible counter play up

393
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.362
on top side or dive if there's a play ready,

394
00:15:30.372 --> 00:15:33.812
but they don't want to over invest and waste time with an objective coming right up.

395
00:15:33.822 --> 00:15:35.043
So get back down to bottom

396
00:15:35.242 --> 00:15:36.341
30 seconds on that Dragon Rees

397
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:36.961
born, but it's

398
00:15:37.221 --> 00:15:38.562
kick who's gone up towards his drugs and

399
00:15:38.572 --> 00:15:41.502
carrier has retaken the both side vision allowing

400
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:45.081
Vega to push into mid way and then move towards the both side to feel safe.

401
00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:46.661
They should be able to secure that dragon pretty he

402
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:49.461
alrighty. We've still got the stolen

403
00:15:49.622 --> 00:15:50.812
Azier ultimate on

404
00:15:51.002 --> 00:15:52.041
Deca as well.

405
00:15:52.052 --> 00:15:55.692
There's a ton of playmaking potential here on either side back

406
00:15:55.702 --> 00:15:57.421
to what you guys were talking about in the draft.

407
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:03.151
The lack of front line is going to be very heavily felt once we get into more of

408
00:16:03.161 --> 00:16:07.260
these big team fights and it's t one with control over the river as the Drake spawn.

409
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.700
Another big thing with T one getting control of

410
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.000
that river like you're talking about is the Renata

411
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.000
s that can come from

412
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:13.560
Kia.

413
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.830
He can cut off these entrances with the wide,

414
00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:19.080
wide crowd control that is afforded to him.

415
00:16:19.091 --> 00:16:22.390
-- Let's see about it. So DRX, they bully them off.
-- Wow,

416
00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.031
DRX showing up, forcing T one back a little bit.

417
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:29.440
Seconds him on the flag. The second trick stole it.

418
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.221
Owner gets him and he gets away. Z

419
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.880
and the rest of TRX, they won't have a whole lot more to do.

420
00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:38.979
-- But that is two Drakes to nothing now for
-- T one ocean.

421
00:16:38.989 --> 00:16:42.659
So for T one as well, if they look forward to the next couple of dragons,

422
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.140
DRX very late to this play.

423
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.760
They managed to find an avenue in. It did turn into a little bit of a 5050. But tw

424
00:16:48.429 --> 00:16:51.640
had really good positioning and set up in terms of vision before they had arrived.

425
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.080
Still

426
00:16:52.299 --> 00:16:53.869
a little bit of pressure on this both sides as Zeca

427
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:56.299
is the one catching both wave and deft has moved towards.

428
00:16:56.729 --> 00:16:57.049
Yeah,

429
00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:58.780
Kosha coming down the river too.

430
00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:02.619
I love both these jungler, the confidence even after the 95 health left on RFID

431
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.979
owner says, don't worry, I got this one,

432
00:17:05.406 --> 00:17:05.426
the,

433
00:17:05.767 --> 00:17:06.047
with the game

434
00:17:06.238 --> 00:17:07.696
on the carrier gets, at least his flash

435
00:17:08.186 --> 00:17:10.696
doesn't follow through the o a little bit scared of owner.

436
00:17:10.738 --> 00:17:13.656
And if you've watched DDRX versus T one, the majority of this year,

437
00:17:13.666 --> 00:17:17.696
it's just been a slow bleed out for the RXT one had better macro in the regular season.

438
00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:20.238
They had more pushing lanes and had more options to play for.

439
00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:23.637
And it was just a slow and steady loss every single time for DRX.

440
00:17:23.646 --> 00:17:26.877
Barring the last time that they faced each other in round two of summer

441
00:17:26.887 --> 00:17:29.618
where DRX actually had a pretty good goal lead and a massive kill lead.

442
00:17:29.628 --> 00:17:31.927
But it was T ones Macro that brought them back into this and

443
00:17:31.937 --> 00:17:34.817
it's DRX is Macro that has improved so much in this international tour

444
00:17:35.147 --> 00:17:36.468
and talking about Macro,

445
00:17:36.478 --> 00:17:38.358
that's the other thing that really stood out for

446
00:17:38.368 --> 00:17:41.378
me about T one in their semifinal last weekend.

447
00:17:41.437 --> 00:17:42.027
It was the Bo

448
00:17:42.238 --> 00:17:47.088
Tiff and it was the decisions being made as a team, not just later on,

449
00:17:47.098 --> 00:17:51.897
but early two to outmaneuver JDG and constantly find advantages.

450
00:17:51.907 --> 00:17:52.328
-- Yeah,
-- I think

451
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:52.478
you

452
00:17:52.628 --> 00:17:54.537
are one of the best in the world, in fact,

453
00:17:54.547 --> 00:17:57.718
probably the best in the world now at pushing these leads when you get

454
00:17:57.728 --> 00:18:00.498
this gold lead to be able to set up on the next objective.

455
00:18:00.508 --> 00:18:01.947
Owner comes top again.

456
00:18:02.157 --> 00:18:04.017
Zeus goes in, gets his third plate and RFID

457
00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:06.557
number two about to arrive.

458
00:18:06.567 --> 00:18:08.957
-- But
-- remember RT Herald number one,

459
00:18:08.967 --> 00:18:13.016
despite the fact that there was a fight over this and a lot of players were there,

460
00:18:13.046 --> 00:18:14.616
the eyeball was never claimed.

461
00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:16.717
We never got to see that Harold used.

462
00:18:16.727 --> 00:18:19.656
So the second one, I'm hoping we get some more results from

463
00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:21.437
lots of lane shifts coming in here,

464
00:18:21.447 --> 00:18:23.746
DRX have sent their jungle support up towards home

465
00:18:23.756 --> 00:18:25.357
side for king and death to stay in mid.

466
00:18:25.366 --> 00:18:25.766
So

467
00:18:25.947 --> 00:18:29.477
I wonder if DRX just want to break the Laing phase right now and put the sever in mid,

468
00:18:29.487 --> 00:18:31.116
put the Heinrich towards mid and stop pushing

469
00:18:31.126 --> 00:18:33.467
in these waves building towards those two items.

470
00:18:33.477 --> 00:18:34.796
So you control them up a little bit better.

471
00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:35.276
Yeah,

472
00:18:35.286 --> 00:18:37.465
it's always so nice to be able to get mid push

473
00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:39.615
when you're looking at the next bonds of the objective.

474
00:18:39.625 --> 00:18:43.556
So then you can either move in to this Herald first or once drag comes up.

475
00:18:43.566 --> 00:18:47.456
Of course, you can do the exact same thing from the other side and T one get it first

476
00:18:47.725 --> 00:18:47.765
bs

477
00:18:48.105 --> 00:18:48.776
coming through.

478
00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.206
T one's gonna start it up and

479
00:18:50.826 --> 00:18:53.765
Ze's moving his way towards mid. He doesn't have the TV and faker does.

480
00:18:53.776 --> 00:18:56.936
That allows him to stay in the lane. DRX know this has been started.

481
00:18:56.946 --> 00:18:58.595
The question is, are they gonna contest it?

482
00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:01.605
This is very similar to the dragon where they're just arriving a little bit too late.

483
00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:01.916
Yeah.

484
00:19:01.926 --> 00:19:05.364
T one like clockwork going these neutral

485
00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:08.805
objectives continually posing this question to Dr

486
00:19:09.035 --> 00:19:10.814
X and they get this one without a fight.

487
00:19:10.964 --> 00:19:17.145
The gold lead continues to build 1.5 1000 now 15 minutes into the game for

488
00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:22.675
the second seed from the LCK as faker gets away from the ever frost there of

489
00:19:22.964 --> 00:19:24.755
the extra playmaking potential,

490
00:19:24.765 --> 00:19:27.285
somewhat kind of the fact that Baker does have crown of the shattered

491
00:19:27.295 --> 00:19:29.655
green going to make it harder to kill him when they go in.

492
00:19:29.665 --> 00:19:32.994
And especially considering the squishing nature of both compositions.

493
00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:34.625
I like this purchase from Baker

494
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.439
definitely agree.

495
00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:41.579
And he one showing why a lot of people had them favorites in this match up here.

496
00:19:41.589 --> 00:19:42.520
The lane phase,

497
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:47.060
very oppressive from them and being able to consistently push the tempo

498
00:19:48.339 --> 00:19:49.150
still hovering around this

499
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:49.579
side

500
00:19:50.609 --> 00:19:52.890
doesn't look like they're giving much resources to faker.

501
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.329
He has TP and they want to look for a play through to

502
00:19:55.589 --> 00:19:57.140
king and seems to be the target for them.

503
00:19:57.489 --> 00:20:00.979
Owner is actually gonna base and move towards mid. You have to expect. So very stock

504
00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:01.680
standard

505
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.680
swap of late phases here just moving around pieces on the map

506
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.369
to r control

507
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.229
around mid.

508
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.880
No new objective just yet.

509
00:20:08.219 --> 00:20:11.069
-- Well,
-- the big thing I'm looking at is we have solo laner

510
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.280
hitting their level 11 2nd level ultimate power spikes here.

511
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.987
That means the dives, the first potential is really starting to get high.

512
00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:23.866
So I'm expecting to see more of these plays. I'm expecting to see more of these rooms.

513
00:20:23.876 --> 00:20:28.046
I'm expecting to start seeing some dives and a little bit of testing

514
00:20:28.057 --> 00:20:30.977
the water to see if they can just skill check their opponents.

515
00:20:31.067 --> 00:20:31.097
And

516
00:20:31.256 --> 00:20:33.786
one of the ones who can pull the trigger first, they have that Herald,

517
00:20:33.886 --> 00:20:35.477
they probably want to put it towards mid or 12.

518
00:20:35.487 --> 00:20:37.246
I mean, every single tower is incredibly low.

519
00:20:37.256 --> 00:20:38.616
They're having push in all of these three

520
00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:40.477
lanes which allows them to control this map.

521
00:20:40.487 --> 00:20:41.337
So well,

522
00:20:41.744 --> 00:20:43.114
grouping up now trying to find

523
00:20:43.223 --> 00:20:45.004
an avenue to get a little bit of vision.

524
00:20:45.093 --> 00:20:47.764
Maybe they can look for a pick carry is still not having that flash up.

525
00:20:47.774 --> 00:20:50.453
There's a ward around it, but owner is ready to cover.

526
00:20:50.494 --> 00:20:53.374
-- Yeah, I
-- think their biggest advantage they could set up for themselves here.

527
00:20:53.384 --> 00:20:56.683
DRX is trying to establish that vision control over the dragon

528
00:20:56.693 --> 00:20:59.624
before it spawns because he won since they got that rip

529
00:20:59.864 --> 00:21:03.173
number two so late, they can sync up the activation of the second riff

530
00:21:03.364 --> 00:21:07.173
here with the spawn of this dragon, you know, make a hard push first to keep

531
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:10.470
priority on mid, then slip down to the objective.

532
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.401
Heimerdinger does so well though this pick that has been so

533
00:21:13.411 --> 00:21:16.581
fun throughout world when your opponents have to come face,

534
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.281
check you into brush and that's what barrel is trying to accomplish.

535
00:21:19.701 --> 00:21:19.770
You see

536
00:21:19.941 --> 00:21:20.010
the

537
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.880
tots being placed towards being put down, my eyes are on

538
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.821
Zeca for this next fight. It would be a third dragon for t

539
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:28.821
one. Of course. Ocean salt points. DRX, first ones in the river, Z

540
00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.090
has a great position to look for

541
00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:32.750
walking down.

542
00:21:33.469 --> 00:21:34.170
Remember

543
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.660
has no stolen. Ultimate right now. So that's a big deal. What's he going to steal?

544
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.819
When is he going to steal it? Making the right choice goes a long way.

545
00:21:43.829 --> 00:21:47.099
First, Harald of the game summoned up here in mid lane,

546
00:21:47.109 --> 00:21:51.099
this will be the first turret killed by either side and it's mid lane.

547
00:21:51.109 --> 00:21:52.910
Tier one dropping T one,

548
00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:55.579
they pick up the tower and they get the wave in,

549
00:21:55.589 --> 00:21:58.689
but it doesn't give them an avenue into this dragon because King and T beat bolt

550
00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.140
and

551
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.380
Zeus needs to respond.

552
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.770
It's gonna be a dance around vision here as Baker is the first one to step up.

553
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.250
Owners going towards mid wave King, it will find the bot

554
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:11.459
-- lane of T 10 That's now
-- where they wanna be going, TRX, they're ready to go.

555
00:22:11.469 --> 00:22:13.560
Can they survive? No carrier

556
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:19.415
-- will fall? But he's traded back for Zecca, a one for one that should favor
-- T

557
00:22:19.594 --> 00:22:22.984
one. That was a fantastic set up for DRX. So it's a little bit of a backfire to go.

558
00:22:22.994 --> 00:22:26.135
One for one, a couple of ultimates used from T one. DRX.

559
00:22:26.145 --> 00:22:29.415
The same dragon is still up but DRX still looking for a pick. They're hoping that

560
00:22:29.765 --> 00:22:31.285
Kushi walks back through this tribe,

561
00:22:31.295 --> 00:22:33.185
-- which I think t one thought they had to go through
-- but

562
00:22:33.324 --> 00:22:36.885
lane there and look at this Baker goes mid to put up the Azer

563
00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:39.515
turret, try and get his mid priority that way

564
00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:41.954
and then he can come right over. Remember

565
00:22:42.349 --> 00:22:46.160
she has well stole the other dragon Kenny fish around here.

566
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.729
-- They've got vision inside the dragon pit and teleport coming
-- right out.

567
00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:51.020
All right, teleport from

568
00:22:51.339 --> 00:22:54.329
Zeus Bottom lane, Kenan and Barrel gonna keep him back.

569
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:54.709
Zeus

570
00:22:54.819 --> 00:22:57.069
ready to try to outplay here with a sole unbound,

571
00:22:57.219 --> 00:23:02.849
immediately reset his position. His job was to distract and distract.

572
00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:06.170
He did Drake secure as Baker goes in

573
00:23:06.744 --> 00:23:07.494
on the run for

574
00:23:09.515 --> 00:23:09.535
the

575
00:23:10.114 --> 00:23:10.545
aged

576
00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:11.755
and

577
00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:17.344
is down. Faker gets the kill and T one are ready to go.

578
00:23:17.444 --> 00:23:21.234
-- T one so
-- precise just dominating this game, Zeus

579
00:23:21.805 --> 00:23:24.305
magnificent slide of hand on the bottom side but they're not done yet.

580
00:23:24.314 --> 00:23:27.704
Keegan looking for the type onto faker. He just walks out of the inferno

581
00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:28.944
chains and goes for it.

582
00:23:29.375 --> 00:23:29.805
But

583
00:23:30.015 --> 00:23:30.265
Faker

584
00:23:31.589 --> 00:23:35.510
and Baker gets Barrel and T one's ready for more po

585
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:40.030
six on the run but the ruined king will barely survive.

586
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:44.560
Owner walks away and now T one, Mike just pays for it. King's

587
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.560
ready to chase down Kumar

588
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:46.540
even further.

589
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:46.790
Say

590
00:23:46.949 --> 00:23:48.359
coming around from the side. King

591
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.390
backing away. T one getting another Baker getting another

592
00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:55.560
beca running home

593
00:23:56.291 --> 00:23:59.472
turning into a slaughter in game one boys.

594
00:23:59.482 --> 00:24:03.651
20 minutes here and T one have three Drakes as well as the gold leaves.

595
00:24:03.661 --> 00:24:07.712
-- Huge
-- swing of gold. Now for a T one massive fight around the dragon.

596
00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:09.732
They played it with so much patience.

597
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:13.531
There was never a moment where they felt rushed or pressured to just take a fight.

598
00:24:13.541 --> 00:24:15.332
All of a sudden, they're just playing through waves,

599
00:24:15.342 --> 00:24:16.692
making sure they have numbers advantage.

600
00:24:16.702 --> 00:24:18.942
They sneak it away under Dr X's nose.

601
00:24:18.952 --> 00:24:21.021
Then DRX kind of think they have to get into this fight.

602
00:24:21.124 --> 00:24:21.624
And T one

603
00:24:21.734 --> 00:24:22.823
are the ones who stand

604
00:24:22.943 --> 00:24:22.963
to

605
00:24:23.514 --> 00:24:26.614
playing with supreme confidence.

606
00:24:27.073 --> 00:24:30.963
Zeus is here in his first year on the international stage.

607
00:24:30.973 --> 00:24:34.323
The sleight of hand to distract the RDRX down to the bottom side.

608
00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:38.984
-- Then Baker says we collapse on them, pull off the pincer and this
-- is the, the severe,

609
00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:39.343
right?

610
00:24:39.384 --> 00:24:41.303
Not very good range in terms of hitting back.

611
00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.394
The Azer is just damaging your health for

612
00:24:43.514 --> 00:24:45.843
death falls and then t won't look for another play.

613
00:24:45.956 --> 00:24:49.706
-- We've got to fight on
-- life. We've already got that play right now.

614
00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:52.556
Pic on the run, but he'll run nowhere.

615
00:24:52.566 --> 00:24:57.735
Baker goes on a rampage and Barrow goes down with them. T one fine two.

616
00:24:57.745 --> 00:25:00.755
They find the jungler and they find their way to the bear.

617
00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.865
-- There
-- is a reason why T one is undefeated versus DRX.

618
00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:06.975
They're outclassing them in every single role right now.

619
00:25:06.985 --> 00:25:10.615
And T one will pick up that Barack just shy of 21 minutes in the game.

620
00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:15.869
Absolute domination here.

621
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.839
The objective bounties are already up the game signaling just how far ahead T

622
00:25:21.849 --> 00:25:25.829
one are and they picked right up where they left off this team,

623
00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:28.969
their ascent has been so fun to watch.

624
00:25:28.979 --> 00:25:33.810
Consistently outplay people in drafts in mechanics on the stage,

625
00:25:33.819 --> 00:25:36.310
pressing these objectives at every turn

626
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:37.359
King

627
00:25:37.609 --> 00:25:37.859
in.

628
00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:40.089
Getting into a bit of A one B one here but

629
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.211
also nearby Baker ready to respond to King. It is low

630
00:25:44.331 --> 00:25:44.620
and

631
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:48.140
takes the kill. Now with the full retreat coming out

632
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:52.901
is going to whip the shuffle and T one just has to wait it out.

633
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:54.301
They'll take out these minions,

634
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.140
Zeca trying to find any sort of a way to get out of this one.

635
00:25:57.151 --> 00:26:00.230
But it ain't going to happen. Sir Baker

636
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.230
-- unstoppable. I
-- especially love the story. Well, never mind owners on.

637
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.941
We don't have time for stories. Owner

638
00:26:08.052 --> 00:26:13.052
looking for another finds, the R finds the Q finds two. There it is.

639
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:14.602
Owner picks up the K.

640
00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:19.052
-- The
-- only story here is that DRX is history after game one. T one are just do

641
00:26:19.472 --> 00:26:19.582
in

642
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:23.732
them and you can't fault TRX because they have to find pigs. T one have a Baron buff.

643
00:26:23.852 --> 00:26:27.732
They're gonna start the siege with his ear and Barre. They can go for 14 with

644
00:26:27.891 --> 00:26:28.332
Zus on the yone.

645
00:26:28.562 --> 00:26:31.832
They tried to make the pigs happen but T one are very aware of their plans.

646
00:26:31.842 --> 00:26:35.442
T one ready to break the pace in half.

647
00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:37.152
First. Inhibitor turret

648
00:26:37.302 --> 00:26:39.512
is gone. Inhibitor a

649
00:26:39.723 --> 00:26:42.883
little bit more. There we go. That will get him across the line.

650
00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:48.942
But DRX comes in with a TPT, one has the Az turret, the sun disc can't protect them

651
00:26:49.402 --> 00:26:52.843
is looking for the angle. He steals the fate sealed away from

652
00:26:53.203 --> 00:26:55.113
Zeus Barrel going to throw down these turrets.

653
00:26:55.123 --> 00:27:00.253
-- But DRX can't find the opportunity they're looking for and T one will
-- escape.

654
00:27:00.262 --> 00:27:03.343
They can't punish the siege. They tried their best with the TP

655
00:27:03.473 --> 00:27:07.933
that a Zir tower is just too much of a threat to go for a 55 underneath their tower.

656
00:27:07.943 --> 00:27:10.473
With this goal deficit. This is the Rx looking for the pick on to

657
00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:14.234
Zeus to stop the 14 on a side lane, but Baker is there to respond.

658
00:27:14.244 --> 00:27:18.504
He knows that their only plan and their only play is killing the top laner of T one.

659
00:27:18.514 --> 00:27:20.323
Baker making sure that doesn't happen.

660
00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:20.514
Yeah.

661
00:27:20.874 --> 00:27:22.693
Deus with a slight ST step back here,

662
00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:27.543
dodging away from the stolen Azer ultimate himself to this player

663
00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:31.073
and T one story with them having confidence in their own

664
00:27:31.604 --> 00:27:33.185
never mind carrier.

665
00:27:33.574 --> 00:27:35.755
That's not where you wanna be buddy

666
00:27:35.875 --> 00:27:36.025
that

667
00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:37.015
goes on a killing three.

668
00:27:37.305 --> 00:27:38.405
There's a second, a

669
00:27:38.614 --> 00:27:40.324
shutdown drr

670
00:27:40.734 --> 00:27:44.155
-- get two for nothing.
-- 20 seconds on the dragon spawn as well.

671
00:27:44.165 --> 00:27:46.685
That will be the soul of T one. But look at Faker.

672
00:27:46.694 --> 00:27:49.464
He's just barreling down midlane looking for another inhibitor.

673
00:27:49.474 --> 00:27:53.165
Looks like two will fall because all of DRX are staying base are coming in. But Zer

674
00:27:53.535 --> 00:27:54.675
doesn't have the TP. It's Oer

675
00:27:54.834 --> 00:27:54.954
in Kuma

676
00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:58.744
who will play patiently and faker with the TP coming back up soon,

677
00:27:59.036 --> 00:28:02.436
-- that one might be able to match the numbers around this dragon
-- fights.

678
00:28:02.446 --> 00:28:08.326
Baker in mid lane, taking out the in hib DRX immediately jumping on to the Drake.

679
00:28:08.336 --> 00:28:11.926
They want to stop this soul by any means possible owners coming

680
00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:12.316
in.

681
00:28:12.526 --> 00:28:14.076
Sonic wave over the wall.

682
00:28:14.086 --> 00:28:18.485
Owner still waiting for it, not going to happen, objective bounty ad Rx,

683
00:28:18.495 --> 00:28:19.735
but now they got to be ready to run.

684
00:28:19.776 --> 00:28:23.745
-- They've got to exfiltrate and T one will not
-- pursue even though it

685
00:28:23.755 --> 00:28:26.505
really hurts to give up your mid inhibitor to faker there you have

686
00:28:26.607 --> 00:28:31.616
have to stop this soul here for DRX. You also get the objective bounty shutdown

687
00:28:31.837 --> 00:28:34.506
trying to make some of uh of this gold deficit up.

688
00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.187
They need a couple more items, spikes.

689
00:28:36.197 --> 00:28:39.496
You can see King has just picked up the death stents, but it's infinity edge on death.

690
00:28:39.506 --> 00:28:40.327
The three items sever

691
00:28:40.437 --> 00:28:43.677
that DRX need to look towards double 14 right now, actually ahead of gays

692
00:28:44.116 --> 00:28:44.987
in terms of level.

693
00:28:44.996 --> 00:28:48.187
So the sever will keep the wave clear going on the top and mid inhibitor.

694
00:28:48.197 --> 00:28:50.766
T one needs to stop pressuring the map a little bit harder,

695
00:28:50.776 --> 00:28:53.187
put their foot on the gas and look for this bolt tier too.

696
00:28:53.197 --> 00:28:54.197
-- Yeah, from
-- T one's first,

697
00:28:54.718 --> 00:28:59.567
there is one lane to go to with super going in both mid and top lane, just

698
00:28:59.748 --> 00:29:03.137
group up on bottom side, pressure it in continue to take objectives.

699
00:29:03.147 --> 00:29:05.277
Don't let DRX farm comfortably.

700
00:29:05.557 --> 00:29:08.647
Derek's going to hold this, but owner actually fails to kick flash there,

701
00:29:08.968 --> 00:29:10.677
just dashes backwards the second.

702
00:29:10.787 --> 00:29:13.958
-- The JT one hopes over the
-- wolf and that's very important.

703
00:29:13.968 --> 00:29:16.947
TRX cannot afford to just lose a man for nothing here. A

704
00:29:17.057 --> 00:29:17.828
TP under the

705
00:29:18.128 --> 00:29:18.287
heer to

706
00:29:19.468 --> 00:29:21.797
finds him, but he runs backwards to

707
00:29:22.029 --> 00:29:25.009
circuit attack his own team. He still gets away.

708
00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:30.129
But that's the final tier two turret falling on the side of Drxt one

709
00:29:30.139 --> 00:29:36.288
maintains a 7.5 1000 goal lead with less than two minutes until Baron responds.

710
00:29:36.298 --> 00:29:39.048
And I think seizing that ball tier three for the final inhibitor is

711
00:29:39.058 --> 00:29:41.078
going to be a bit tough for T one at the moment.

712
00:29:41.109 --> 00:29:43.418
One minute, 30 seconds, like you said, flowers on that Baron,

713
00:29:43.428 --> 00:29:45.139
that's gonna be the next threat for T one.

714
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:46.308
A little bit of top side vision.

715
00:29:46.318 --> 00:29:49.639
Keep that mid push have Zeus on a side lane perhaps depending on his team

716
00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:53.199
-- timer and then look to force that Baron force DRX to walk
-- into you.

717
00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:56.750
And if we're looking at the hope for the comeback for DRX,

718
00:29:56.849 --> 00:30:00.760
the underdog story of the entire tournament, you see it right there

719
00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.239
has completed the infinity edge. This is their hope.

720
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.800
The siver late game farming trying to annihilate these minion waves,

721
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.359
see if they can pull out a team fight.

722
00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:11.000
Meanwhile,

723
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:15.339
big objective is to keep vision control over your red quadrant of your jungle.

724
00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:17.270
So that you don't get into very dangerous

725
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:21.100
-- scenarios. It comes up in only 57
-- seconds. I'm trying to deny that red buff there.

726
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.750
But the Rx off,

727
00:30:21.911 --> 00:30:23.531
pull it back. You're absolutely right there. Kobe.

728
00:30:23.541 --> 00:30:26.890
It's the, it's the sever of death that needs to find the damage in the fights.

729
00:30:26.901 --> 00:30:28.661
He's a little bit outraged by Faker Zaz

730
00:30:28.801 --> 00:30:31.321
who has three items complete building towards that rabbit on

731
00:30:31.531 --> 00:30:33.301
Zeus also picked up his three items like DRX

732
00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:35.401
need to find some kind of vision around this.

733
00:30:35.411 --> 00:30:37.911
Baron and juggle the waves while they do so.

734
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.081
T one in control of this game from the very start 30 seconds

735
00:30:43.201 --> 00:30:45.031
until the Baron spawns

736
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.449
going to clear out some of the vision here, DRX must be very careful.

737
00:30:49.459 --> 00:30:55.219
A single misstep will give away this Baron and any hope left in this game,

738
00:30:55.229 --> 00:31:00.140
Mount T one right there can DRX scale that mountain?

739
00:31:00.319 --> 00:31:03.189
It's going to be a difficult next five minutes for them.

740
00:31:03.199 --> 00:31:06.780
Baron coming up in only 10 seconds and you see how ferociously they're

741
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.826
-- fighting over the vision just to have a safe place to check
-- from.

742
00:31:09.845 --> 00:31:11.495
They have one blue orb left on de

743
00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:14.255
that'll be an emergency usage in case they lose all vision.

744
00:31:14.265 --> 00:31:17.245
And right now they can't see it. T one are starting it up with their 80 carrier.

745
00:31:17.255 --> 00:31:18.375
Top owner can jump over

746
00:31:18.505 --> 00:31:20.446
very quickly. Where's the blue or from depth? He still has it.

747
00:31:20.456 --> 00:31:22.316
I think up he is gonna pop it over the wall. They,

748
00:31:23.245 --> 00:31:25.495
there's no time t one

749
00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:26.895
that gets the bear.

750
00:31:27.696 --> 00:31:29.166
Now the siege will come in on that B

751
00:31:29.296 --> 00:31:31.836
tier three. You can see the pings on that both side of the map already.

752
00:31:31.911 --> 00:31:35.771
For T one they know the easy way to win. This one is just to push in these lanes.

753
00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:37.891
Go towards bolt. Try to take that final inhibitor.

754
00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:41.362
-- DRX will be forced to fight them underneath their tower and
-- T one.

755
00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:44.682
Now with the Baron buff, you have the luxury of going 131,

756
00:31:44.692 --> 00:31:48.732
pushing all lanes in getting these inhibitors as they're responding.

757
00:31:49.052 --> 00:31:49.151
Zeus

758
00:31:49.312 --> 00:31:53.121
already has been allocated up to that top lane. Push it in this yone.

759
00:31:53.352 --> 00:31:55.092
So oppressive

760
00:31:55.592 --> 00:31:58.562
DRX is gonna have to fight on all sides right now.

761
00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.550
DRX is caught in such a difficult position here in this game.

762
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.650
They have to weather a storm that is barreling towards this bottom side,

763
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.010
-- barreling towards their last remaining
-- inhibitor to sometimes the

764
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.489
best hope when you're in a position like this,

765
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.280
assaulted on all sides, just sever

766
00:32:15.449 --> 00:32:19.489
alt and go attack one of them as quickly as you can because the more time you give t one,

767
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.890
the more damage they do.

768
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:26.859
It's T one on the offensive. Three men, bottom one men in each other lane say

769
00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.930
is leading the charge to

770
00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:31.807
that exposed inhibitor in top Baker, maintaining pressure in mid

771
00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:32.026
Ka

772
00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:33.567
has got all the push power in the

773
00:32:33.577 --> 00:32:36.636
world here in bottom last standing inhibitor turret.

774
00:32:36.646 --> 00:32:38.416
That one is going to fall

775
00:32:38.796 --> 00:32:41.786
can just go ahead clear that out. No problem

776
00:32:42.307 --> 00:32:45.807
taking out the other inhibitor there in top lane two more

777
00:32:45.937 --> 00:32:51.396
Os will do it. He'll just let the minions take it out. Triple in his game for T one.

778
00:32:51.406 --> 00:32:53.237
That's going to be the nail in the call for DRX.

779
00:32:53.256 --> 00:32:55.276
They have a small 32nd to 1 minute window

780
00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:57.227
before the super minions will pile in the soul.

781
00:32:57.237 --> 00:32:57.337
Is

782
00:32:57.803 --> 00:32:57.963
for

783
00:32:58.213 --> 00:32:58.244
one.

784
00:32:58.543 --> 00:33:00.323
Are they gonna run down towards this dragon pit and

785
00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:02.223
fight it or they're just gonna give everything up?

786
00:33:02.234 --> 00:33:02.313
Guma

787
00:33:02.644 --> 00:33:05.354
Yushi even tried to use the old unto death spell shield came through.

788
00:33:05.364 --> 00:33:06.864
And even with that ultimate down,

789
00:33:06.874 --> 00:33:09.343
DRX didn't feel confident enough to find an engage.

790
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:10.943
The er X are in tough

791
00:33:11.303 --> 00:33:11.764
uh su

792
00:33:12.024 --> 00:33:14.864
such a tough spot but they have been in so many other

793
00:33:14.874 --> 00:33:17.803
tough spots and they have come back in a lot of them.

794
00:33:17.813 --> 00:33:22.104
They had not beaten Gen G either and ended up coming back in that series.

795
00:33:22.114 --> 00:33:26.543
T one will finish up their soul and then they will march down mid lane

796
00:33:26.651 --> 00:33:29.541
to finish this game one up.

797
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.311
Well, there is also less than one minute remaining until Baron spawns again.

798
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.490
If t one want to play this as safely and as shortly as possible,

799
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.490
they will make their way over to that pit,

800
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.630
they will secure that objective and then they will push for the win.

801
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:48.390
That's the remaining timer on the bar and I'm showing you guys that's just my bad.

802
00:33:48.401 --> 00:33:48.781
I was checking to see

803
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:48.921
if

804
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:52.161
they have it for another 45 seconds.

805
00:33:52.171 --> 00:33:55.750
They can take out this in hip that has just respond. And then

806
00:33:56.157 --> 00:33:59.917
-- TRX still in the same impossible
-- position and the emperor

807
00:34:00.307 --> 00:34:04.157
is back with a rabbit on death cap this year. It's going to do so much damage.

808
00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:04.887
Davis might even find an

809
00:34:05.118 --> 00:34:05.498
already.

810
00:34:05.708 --> 00:34:06.777
He was looking for it

811
00:34:06.998 --> 00:34:09.907
sealed only going to find one king and getting away for

812
00:34:09.917 --> 00:34:13.527
now owner still looking for the angle flash kick is available.

813
00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:16.467
DRX fully in defensive position.

814
00:34:16.478 --> 00:34:22.027
Now as barrels only got 40% HPT one looking for any angle.

815
00:34:22.038 --> 00:34:24.857
All they got to do is find one and 8000

816
00:34:25.483 --> 00:34:30.743
is definitely enough to end this game. Do Minion Wade making its way up. Owner

817
00:34:30.893 --> 00:34:33.322
threatens to engage change of corruption going out

818
00:34:33.503 --> 00:34:37.092
SECA looking for the play but Oner goes golden. He's going to stay alive for now.

819
00:34:37.103 --> 00:34:38.864
Backing up yet again. Next is to

820
00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:42.454
first one is about to die a little bit of HP still keeping it around

821
00:34:42.954 --> 00:34:45.763
SECA is only a one quarter health he has to heal.

822
00:34:46.914 --> 00:34:47.013
He oi

823
00:34:47.194 --> 00:34:51.773
beats the sonic wave. No resonating strike just yet. TRX are out of turret

824
00:34:51.974 --> 00:34:53.664
and out of time

825
00:34:54.271 --> 00:34:59.771
still looking for the end. Still looking to keep going. The next is all that remains.

826
00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:03.231
-- I
-- love how owner keeps checking them, seeing if they will flinch,

827
00:35:03.241 --> 00:35:05.612
jumping in on the leasing but not going for the flash play.

828
00:35:05.652 --> 00:35:06.791
-- And here comes
-- the end.

829
00:35:07.181 --> 00:35:07.221
Zeus

830
00:35:07.352 --> 00:35:08.592
looks for Q three.

831
00:35:08.892 --> 00:35:11.271
Zaka goes in with a stolen a year old but it ain't gonna do a whole lot.

832
00:35:11.281 --> 00:35:14.172
They still got a little bit of damage but it is not enough. Barrel's gonna an eye deter

833
00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:20.552
good an it one will find the fight and find the win in. Game one. Clean.

834
00:35:20.562 --> 00:35:23.372
Come and collect it. The well oiled machine

835
00:35:23.479 --> 00:35:27.108
tw strikes again. Very similar game to

836
00:35:27.329 --> 00:35:31.888
the DRX Gen G series in that game one where it was just clean from the get go out,

837
00:35:31.898 --> 00:35:35.029
skirmishing out, setting up in terms of objectives and vision.

838
00:35:35.108 --> 00:35:37.789
That man on your screen right there on the AZ just dishing

839
00:35:37.799 --> 00:35:41.079
out so much damage was never really touched in these fights.

840
00:35:41.289 --> 00:35:42.698
-- You
-- can say that again.

841
00:35:42.708 --> 00:35:47.938
Every T one member clapping in this game number one,

842
00:35:47.948 --> 00:35:51.819
-- establishing the dominance here right from the get
-- go.

843
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:52.579
We got to
