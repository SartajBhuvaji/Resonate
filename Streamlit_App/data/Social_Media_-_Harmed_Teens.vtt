00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.680
More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram.

1
00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:14.250
They um like told me to kill myself and told me

2
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.700
that I like was ugly and I looked like a clown.

3
00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:19.829
But then I realized they're only making fun of

4
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.549
me because I'm giving them attention about it.

5
00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm a pro social media because I like to send memes to my grandma.

6
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.299
I like to keep connected with my friends.

7
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.540
But most importantly, I think it's a useful platform and tool.

8
00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:40.720
I didn't know what a trans guy was before I was on Tik Tok.

9
00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:44.040
I just thought I was a, like a masculine, like girl

10
00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.689
have social media but like, I don't use them.

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.450
I kind of just have enough posts that doesn't make me seem like a loser.

12
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.709
I find it really toxic because um everything's based off of numbers.

13
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.450
I just wanna see how if pro social media has helped

14
00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.940
their life because it hasn't really helped me as a person.

15
00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.739
I'm a content creator on tiktok, Instagram, Snapchat.

16
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.769
I'd say that I would make like 30 to $40,000 a month.

17
00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:19.040
I'm antisocial media because of the present algorithms in place

18
00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:21.089
windows.

19
00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:22.540
No,

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.410
I think Tik Tok is because it's manipulating

21
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.500
their users and taking so much information from them

22
00:01:28.769 --> 00:01:31.830
and they're showing that through the For you page and people don't care.

23
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.529
Hi, I'm Alexa.

24
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.440
I'm 18 years old and I'm pro social media and I

25
00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:46.910
-- love social media just because of the culture it
-- brings.

26
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.809
Hi, I'm Phillips plural. I am on the pro side and I just like to spread awareness.

27
00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:59.970
Hi, I'm Alex. I'm 16. I'm on Instagram, tiktok and a little bit of youtube

28
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.180
and I am pro social media because it helped me meet

29
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.660
a lot of other trans kids when I was struggling.

30
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.150
Hi, I'm Ella.

31
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.429
I'm 15 and I'm antisocial media because I

32
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.279
find it really toxic and competitive for myself.

33
00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.009
Hi, I'm Emma. I'm 18

34
00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.119
and I am antisocial media and I'm the CEO of a movement

35
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.770
-- that works to kind of promote a healthier existence on
-- social media.

36
00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.729
My name is Emmy. I'm 16.

37
00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:29.369
I'm antisocial media because of personal experience and like general anxiety.

38
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.619
I

39
00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.949
want

40
00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:31.339
to

41
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.460
go

42
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.669
on

43
00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.929
that.

44
00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.759
Yeah,

45
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.899
I'm gonna read out a prompt if you agree, step forward

46
00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:40.389
and if you disagree, stay

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.639
good.

48
00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.660
I spend more than three hours on social media daily.

49
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.820
I definitely find myself scrolling for hours when I'm bored and

50
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.770
-- I definitely get sucked in and I can't stop
-- for me.

51
00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:01.360
Um, a lot of my school stuff got pushed to social media, all the clubs and orgs.

52
00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:05.660
Another one that's more personal to me is that um keeps you in touch with your family.

53
00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.550
All my family is in Vietnam. So,

54
00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:08.160
yeah.

55
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.539
Yeah.

56
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.750
And a lot of my friends are online and I'm just like, on their account, you know,

57
00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.940
like hyping them up or just like texting them on Instagram because I don't,

58
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.179
-- I don't like to use regular
-- tag.

59
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.240
It's definitely my number one source of entertainment.

60
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.190
I don't watch as much youtube or Netflix and I kind of just go through Tik Tok and like,

61
00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.470
that's what brings me joy.

62
00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:24.029
Sometimes

63
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.309
Tik

64
00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.539
Tok

65
00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.789
is

66
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.500
-- short attention
-- spans.

67
00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.899
You get sucked in like you go on for like 30 minutes, you're just there forever.

68
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.460
-- And that happens to me all
-- the time.

69
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.520
But sometime I spend more time comparing myself to others.

70
00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.360
-- Oh, I'm not getting that many likes and it kind of brings me
-- down.

71
00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.779
But um if I went on Tik Tok and I kind of

72
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:43.860
just analyzed everyone and just was like trying to compare myself,

73
00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.279
then it would definitely bring me down.

74
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.639
But just as a content creator, I just have the mindset of like, oh,

75
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.979
this is what you make and maybe I can make it differently

76
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.729
prior to a movement. I started called log off.

77
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.339
I spent about five hours on social media day and it

78
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.789
was to talk with my sister who was in college,

79
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.490
but I also got really bad um repercussions about

80
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.350
my body and I felt really terrible after scrolling.

81
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.600
But you know, after I rethought about how I wanted to spend my time on there,

82
00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:12.990
it became much more productive.

83
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.149
So I still spend time on like Instagram.

84
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.869
It's just to like, get a meme from my college sister or to like,

85
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.700
talk with friends that really bring me up.

86
00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.709
-- I
-- have an Instagram, I have a tiktok but like, I never open the app. Like,

87
00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:28.744
ever, I'm clearly not the skinniest and like I have alopecia.

88
00:04:28.755 --> 00:04:31.885
So I'm losing my hair and like, I'll look on social media and like,

89
00:04:31.894 --> 00:04:35.795
I'll see some like K pop star and they're like a double zero with the

90
00:04:35.804 --> 00:04:39.244
longest hair on the planet and they're like s like their skin is silk smooth.

91
00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:41.755
And when I take pictures, no matter what I do,

92
00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:44.234
you can see the whites of my scalp.

93
00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:47.325
So I don't take photos and because I don't take photos,

94
00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:49.725
I don't have anything to post and because I don't have anything to post,

95
00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:52.234
I don't see a point in opening the app.

96
00:04:52.244 --> 00:04:54.595
Plus I'd rather spend my time reading.

97
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.010
I used to be more um meek and mild.

98
00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:01.290
I was just like, oh no, they're gonna call me, I'm ugly and they're gonna hate on me.

99
00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:03.709
But then um when tiktok started blowing up,

100
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.760
one of my videos blew up and I was just like, hey, they don't hate me and I was just like,

101
00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:09.600
oh OK, the confidence it's coming in

102
00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:13.540
and I get 100 notifications a day from my best friend saying I found this new video

103
00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:15.549
you would love and I'll click on it occasionally

104
00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.230
and I love the video because it's funny,

105
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:19.690
it's short and it like matches my personality,

106
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.070
but it makes me really upset when like I facetime

107
00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:23.790
with my friend and she's scrolling through Tik Tok.

108
00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.190
It's really scary to see my friends kind of disconnect with

109
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.579
me and just connect with these people they've never met.

110
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.209
-- What do you think is the
-- misconception pro social media people

111
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.149
that we're narcs and that we kind of hate social media.

112
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.470
Like parents hate social media.

113
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.559
I don't think they really know our stories and know why exactly we

114
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.029
don't want to exist on the platforms in the way that they are.

115
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.910
I've had hurtful things posted about me and the thing about the internet, it's,

116
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.859
it's there forever and it's not like a word that was just said to me on the playground.

117
00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:54.429
It's something that's out there and other people can see

118
00:05:55.359 --> 00:05:56.510
social media

119
00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.299
makes you antisocial.

120
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:08.549
There can be communities found within social media,

121
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.829
but my personal experience with it

122
00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:13.209
and from a lot of stories that I've heard through log off is

123
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.790
that a lot of kids have lost people because of social media.

124
00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:18.290
And I think that that constant mindless scrolling

125
00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.549
allows you to kind of go into this bubble and

126
00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:22.829
just hunker down and to not really talk with people.

127
00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.190
I know a bunch of kids that like,

128
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.859
don't know how to communicate outside of like an emoji

129
00:06:26.915 --> 00:06:28.716
or like outside of like a picture or like,

130
00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:31.855
only have a one picture face and like, we repeatedly take the same, like,

131
00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.825
we'll stop everyone in the friend group to pick a wall and just

132
00:06:34.835 --> 00:06:37.496
sit there and pose and take 100 photos and stand there and wait,

133
00:06:37.506 --> 00:06:38.615
they're like, no, no, I'll take one more.

134
00:06:38.626 --> 00:06:42.115
-- I
-- definitely like would base like entire friend groups to

135
00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:44.696
hang out and just take pictures like we wouldn't communicate.

136
00:06:44.705 --> 00:06:46.885
It would just be pictures just to post on Instagram. And then

137
00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:49.842
I would find myself that like we didn't even connect when we were hanging out.

138
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:51.911
It was wasn't quality time because I feel like, oh,

139
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:53.522
I have to get that perfect photo of all of that.

140
00:06:53.532 --> 00:06:56.641
All of us looking like we're having fun even if we're not,

141
00:06:56.652 --> 00:06:59.332
-- I just need to get that so I can
-- post it after a while.

142
00:06:59.342 --> 00:07:01.391
You feel the pressure and everything.

143
00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:05.201
People start being people and they're just empty profile pictures.

144
00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:08.921
People will come to me and they won't know my name. They'll go by my screen name

145
00:07:09.302 --> 00:07:11.842
and then I'm just like uh am I human?

146
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.290
I like to ask questions and comments and ask like, oh,

147
00:07:17.299 --> 00:07:19.279
where did you get that or you know like what

148
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.019
hair dye did you use or something like that?

149
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.589
Because I think it's a lot more engaging or I

150
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.320
like to sometimes I'll make my like my post,

151
00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:27.600
I'll make it a question.

152
00:07:27.609 --> 00:07:29.000
Like the the the caption,

153
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.679
I like to interact with like a lot

154
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.799
of my followers through comments because I'm uncomfortable,

155
00:07:33.809 --> 00:07:35.320
you know, messaging them personally.

156
00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:37.859
-- It's good to like interact with the people that support
-- you.

157
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:39.440
But what would you say to like bigger influence

158
00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:41.183
like Kylie Jenner, like Kim Kardash

159
00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:44.484
-- that can't have that interaction via the comments
-- and then Alex,

160
00:07:44.493 --> 00:07:46.153
some people just don't even reply to you.

161
00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:48.824
-- Those just double tap, like the message going
-- off.

162
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.954
What you said about like making real human connection.

163
00:07:50.963 --> 00:07:54.433
Have you ever like looked into like social media accounts to like promote that

164
00:07:54.604 --> 00:07:57.313
because I don't know if you guys know we're not really strangers.

165
00:07:57.324 --> 00:07:59.194
If you guys know them, they have a card game, you don't know.

166
00:07:59.204 --> 00:07:59.604
OK,

167
00:07:59.614 --> 00:08:01.324
so it's ba basically a card game

168
00:08:01.334 --> 00:08:03.993
where you have perception analysis and then reflection

169
00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:08.028
and then you just have conversations like or how are you really or you know,

170
00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:10.058
if how is like, what's, what do you, what do you,

171
00:08:10.067 --> 00:08:12.028
what would you name the chapter of this in your life?

172
00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:12.537
And then boom,

173
00:08:12.548 --> 00:08:14.627
we're in a 20 minute conversation that like she

174
00:08:14.638 --> 00:08:16.088
feels really low and she's trying to change.

175
00:08:16.097 --> 00:08:16.708
And the, and you know,

176
00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:18.997
and I would have never thought that if this social media account

177
00:08:19.007 --> 00:08:22.618
didn't push me or didn't encourage me to have deeper conversations.

178
00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:23.467
I agree.

179
00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:25.548
But I think the issue is with the algorithm in

180
00:08:25.558 --> 00:08:27.667
place like that's not popping up on my feed.

181
00:08:27.678 --> 00:08:31.148
Like I'm not, I don't know that those exist and because it's so expansive

182
00:08:31.282 --> 00:08:33.501
and because there's so much hollowness and mindless scrolling, like,

183
00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.702
I've never found that if I found that I would have loved that

184
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.052
-- with the
-- algorithm and the fact that you never see those things,

185
00:08:38.062 --> 00:08:41.221
like I always feel like we're on a whole different side of tiktok than you are

186
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:44.692
and all it takes is just to look up like deep conversations on the internet.

187
00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:46.351
There would have been a vogue article about we're not

188
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:47.651
really friends and then you would have looked it up,

189
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:47.882
you know.

190
00:08:47.892 --> 00:08:49.521
So in order to change your algorithm,

191
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:51.302
you just have to change the things that you're looking for.

192
00:08:51.312 --> 00:08:53.721
But don't you think maybe like the algorithm in place is what's

193
00:08:53.731 --> 00:08:57.052
making it so dangerous because it's like they're pumping out these really terrible

194
00:08:57.156 --> 00:08:58.536
kind of like content videos.

195
00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:00.325
But also you've got like the attention economy

196
00:09:00.335 --> 00:09:02.116
where they're like fighting to get your information

197
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:05.375
-- to then give to people like to put ads in your feed that you won't
-- notice.

198
00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:07.695
Even if you're not on social media, you know, it's gonna do that anyway.

199
00:09:07.705 --> 00:09:09.245
Like if you're searching anything on,

200
00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:11.426
like if you're searching something up on safari

201
00:09:11.505 --> 00:09:13.565
and you go onto your computer onto Chrome,

202
00:09:13.575 --> 00:09:15.466
the ads will probably be the same, you know, it's just,

203
00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:17.976
-- it's just technology,
-- you know.

204
00:09:17.986 --> 00:09:21.276
Um I sat down here saying that social media makes people antisocial.

205
00:09:21.286 --> 00:09:22.926
But hearing Alexa and Alex speak,

206
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.859
it makes me remember that um social media isn't just, you know,

207
00:09:26.869 --> 00:09:28.229
the whole tiktok scene.

208
00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:30.859
It's also schools, there's clubs and stuff.

209
00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:33.700
Um I've made a couple of new friends from social media

210
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.710
because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego.

211
00:09:36.719 --> 00:09:39.500
So I don't think it's necessarily just the whole big fame thing.

212
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.719
There's also the smaller group.

213
00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:46.280
Yeah. I, I'd like to say social media changed my life. I'm uh more confident.

214
00:09:46.289 --> 00:09:49.919
I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab what's near.

215
00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:55.020
I do see how social media can be bad, but I, I like to think of it in a positive light.

216
00:09:55.809 --> 00:09:58.380
I have been bullied on social media.

217
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.419
Mhm

218
00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:07.460
I know you guys remember like those musically days,

219
00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:10.409
I feel like that was my biggest bullying because it's like when you,

220
00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:12.309
it's just like entering a whole different society,

221
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.530
it's just like when you're going out, you're making

222
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.059
videos,

223
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.599
you don't really know what you wanna post or what

224
00:10:15.609 --> 00:10:17.210
you wanna do or what you wanna look like.

225
00:10:17.219 --> 00:10:19.969
So it is gonna be cringy at first and it's not gonna be great.

226
00:10:19.979 --> 00:10:22.260
-- Musically
-- was definitely a dark time.

227
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.210
Um More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram.

228
00:10:26.219 --> 00:10:29.500
They um like told me to kill myself and told me that like,

229
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.390
because I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself.

230
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:32.840
And that

231
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:38.059
I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really,

232
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.820
really let it get to me for a long time.

233
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.419
But then I realized, you know, like,

234
00:10:41.609 --> 00:10:44.580
they're only making fun of me because I'm giving them attention about it.

235
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.669
So I just had to, like,

236
00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:47.640
block them from all my accounts and block

237
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.630
all the people they were following and block

238
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.780
all the people that were following them and then I just had to stop looking.

239
00:10:52.789 --> 00:10:53.840
And if I don't look at it,

240
00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:56.609
-- then I don't know what they're saying.
-- Right. And that's the thing.

241
00:10:56.619 --> 00:10:59.169
It's just like, once you stop looking into it, it's,

242
00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:01.815
you just stop beating the fire and it will die eventually because

243
00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:04.354
-- you just don't even pay it. No mind.
-- I don't have a big following.

244
00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.135
So it's mostly,

245
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:08.775
mostly people I know usually it's Tik Toks and it's not with my name in it,

246
00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:11.174
but you can tell that it's implied towards me

247
00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.094
and I try not to comment but like,

248
00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:14.914
there's some points where they're coming out and saying like,

249
00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:18.755
completely false things about me posting and hating on someone through the

250
00:11:18.765 --> 00:11:22.075
internet is completely different from in person because it's there forever.

251
00:11:22.085 --> 00:11:25.114
You don't have control over that because it's up to them to delete it.

252
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.760
So I

253
00:11:30.219 --> 00:11:34.280
have had rude comments been made about me, but I've never been like,

254
00:11:34.289 --> 00:11:36.599
heavily cyberbullied because I don't really have a big

255
00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:39.059
following and because of the community that I'm in,

256
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.750
I've just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like,

257
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.770
felt like they wanted to kill themselves because

258
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.239
of the rude comments they were getting.

259
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.909
And I just remember like, there were nights when I,

260
00:11:46.965 --> 00:11:50.015
-- I would cry and I'd be so upset because I couldn't really do anything about
-- it.

261
00:11:50.025 --> 00:11:53.104
My cyberbullying experience the first, like,

262
00:11:53.114 --> 00:11:56.044
big one I was in like this like dance team, right?

263
00:11:56.054 --> 00:12:01.044
And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians.

264
00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:03.664
So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And

265
00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.090
you know, like after practice,

266
00:12:05.099 --> 00:12:08.270
like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like

267
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.809
like the duck face thing pose one day,

268
00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.030
like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and

269
00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:15.419
I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram.

270
00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:16.780
So like I did it and then

271
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.320
they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it.

272
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.299
I didn't know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years,

273
00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:26.049
they would continuously like bring me into the photo.

274
00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:28.400
Like I would never just go up, they'd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo?

275
00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:30.960
Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included.

276
00:12:30.969 --> 00:12:33.320
But when I like got a phone and when I got on

277
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.359
Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members,

278
00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:40.039
I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning it's photos of me.

279
00:12:40.049 --> 00:12:43.320
They'll zoom in on me and they'll be like, look at that fat thing, that

280
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.400
monster like, is it trying to pose?

281
00:12:45.409 --> 00:12:49.090
Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think they're cute?

282
00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:50.679
I wasn't like

283
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.640
elementary school. Like, I don't know how to deal with myself.

284
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.849
Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and

285
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.090
you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it

286
00:12:58.299 --> 00:12:59.929
and like a monster. You know what I mean?

287
00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:04.890
-- Social media can cause young people to hurt
-- themselves.

288
00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:11.619
Instagram,

289
00:13:11.969 --> 00:13:13.940
tiktok. Everything is the highlight reel.

290
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.900
My Instagram,

291
00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:18.479
I'm not gonna post the ugliest picture of me when I scroll to my friends,

292
00:13:18.489 --> 00:13:21.659
I in the back of my head, I should know that that, that's the same for them

293
00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:24.929
yet. I'm like, they look so pretty. Why do I not look like that?

294
00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:27.739
And I think for younger generations it's really scary

295
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.799
-- that they're gonna have to deal with
-- this.

296
00:13:28.809 --> 00:13:31.729
I have this one photo that's so vivid in my memory and like

297
00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.929
I'm at like an aquarium and I'm leaning against

298
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.710
like one of the fish tanks and my dad and

299
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.979
my dad and my brother are next to me and I'm

300
00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:41.320
like half my brother's height,

301
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.369
my face sagging my body like my clothes don't fit on me.

302
00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.140
And I'm like, at that time I didn't realize how depressed I was and how,

303
00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:52.450
how much these, like, these, like, dance photos were ruining me.

304
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.549
That's kind of when I knew like, social media is not something I like,

305
00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:57.539
I'm not safe here, you know, and so

306
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.919
an excuse I can make for not pleasing people online

307
00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:01.940
is that I don't use it and then I'll be

308
00:14:02.729 --> 00:14:03.750
ok.

309
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.239
The thing, the bad thing about social media is like,

310
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.710
if you have a bad friend in real life and your mom's like, avoid them,

311
00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:09.729
don't be next to them and stuff.

312
00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:11.710
But on social media, you almost can't avoid them.

313
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.820
And I feel like that's where like a lot,

314
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.469
a lot of kids can get hurt because they common root things on your

315
00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:19.099
things or they don't share the same opinions and those friends are horrible.

316
00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.549
-- You know, I don't
-- know how Tumblr is now because I don't go on it,

317
00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:24.450
but there are a lot of like self harm pages and eating

318
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.409
sort of pages with like ideas to make yourself lose weight.

319
00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:30.510
There's so much of that on Tumblr that I had to get off of Tumblr.

320
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.090
Um And I think that definitely will hurt kids now and in the future,

321
00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:37.840
I just can't imagine being like 10 or 11 or 12 just being

322
00:14:37.849 --> 00:14:40.760
so young and looking through this and taking all these suggestions in,

323
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.159
I'm 18 now, like I go through it and I know better.

324
00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:44.960
But I feel like you could get seriously hurt when

325
00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:47.000
-- you're young because you really just don't know any
-- better.

326
00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:50.799
Yeah. I'll just play back on what you said about how little kids don't know better.

327
00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:55.669
I saw a hack where it was like scoop ice cream and it said microwave the spoon.

328
00:14:55.909 --> 00:14:58.599
Most, most Children wouldn't know. Yeah.

329
00:14:58.609 --> 00:15:03.390
In cases like that it does hurt me to be pro social media. But social media,

330
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.059
I, I think it was always more intended for more discretion.

331
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.979
-- Like I, I have
-- this friend named Jessie Page and she is very,

332
00:15:09.989 --> 00:15:14.840
very like pro body positivity and like pro like, like mental health, you know,

333
00:15:14.849 --> 00:15:16.900
like really, like I wanna get better.

334
00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:19.530
That's why I keep all my posts up because I want people to be

335
00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:23.390
able to go back and look I wasn't on t for three years,

336
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.640
you know, when I was out, you know,

337
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.169
like I was fully out and like fighting for myself to start hormones.

338
00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:29.919
My friend Jessie too, she also

339
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.539
puts before and after she always puts like this is the real me.

340
00:15:34.909 --> 00:15:34.979
Do you

341
00:15:35.109 --> 00:15:35.150
think

342
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:35.570
social media

343
00:15:35.729 --> 00:15:35.809
has

344
00:15:35.969 --> 00:15:36.169
changed your

345
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.349
life

346
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.919
100%? I don't think I would be the person I am if it wasn't for social media.

347
00:15:40.929 --> 00:15:45.239
I first came out on Tik Tok and my parents didn't even know that's how they found out.

348
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.159
Actually,

349
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.630
Children under the age of 13

350
00:15:49.869 --> 00:15:52.469
should not be allowed on social media.

351
00:15:58.409 --> 00:16:02.450
Well, um it's kind of funny because I talked to a lot of organizations with log off.

352
00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.200
And the main point that they try to get across is that they're trying

353
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.750
to advocate for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at

354
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.070
an older age.

355
00:16:10.239 --> 00:16:13.179
Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said that's really stupid.

356
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.869
That's like the drug talk, like, don't do drugs, don't be on social media.

357
00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:16.815
I'm not gonna listen to that.

358
00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:19.054
But then after years of kind of self reflection,

359
00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:22.635
I wish someone would have said you don't need Instagram to have a social

360
00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:25.265
-- life
-- if I go back to like my 13 year old self and like,

361
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:28.294
I didn't have all the experiences I had and I just kind of knew like, oh,

362
00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:30.525
it's a good place I would be posting

363
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:31.955
God knows what

364
00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.494
right. Kids are dumb

365
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.640
and if you give kids a platform to do whatever they want,

366
00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:37.859
they're gonna be dumb.

367
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.440
There's no educational advocacy out there to actually allow for that to happen.

368
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.570
And when they are there,

369
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:47.070
it's this older teacher who like has a completely different outlook on social

370
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.039
media because they never existed in an age where it was your life.

371
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.570
You know, I just feel like it's almost, it's just unrealistic when I was 13,

372
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.919
I was fully on social media making videos every single day.

373
00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.090
So I just feel like if anything, it helped me more when I was 13,

374
00:17:00.099 --> 00:17:01.700
like it really allowed me to just

375
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.608
know what things were and not be so what is going on.

376
00:17:04.618 --> 00:17:07.209
-- Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things
-- because like, I was on social media,

377
00:17:07.219 --> 00:17:11.079
like 11 years old, like I was a child and on social media and my,

378
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:15.729
my dad told me he was like, you know, but you're also trans and you're also like LGBT,

379
00:17:15.739 --> 00:17:15.900
you know,

380
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:18.540
you need to be able to meet people because your bubble

381
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.000
that you would know of trans people would be zero.

382
00:17:21.104 --> 00:17:23.805
Here's the thing we, we, I think we're underestimating Children.

383
00:17:23.814 --> 00:17:24.723
They're relentless.

384
00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:28.984
We put an age limit on Instagram or an age limit on like um an adult type website.

385
00:17:29.084 --> 00:17:30.165
They're still gonna get through.

386
00:17:30.285 --> 00:17:31.234
I didn't have social media.

387
00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:34.645
I was probably like the last couple of people out of my like friends because

388
00:17:34.655 --> 00:17:38.685
my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet is.

389
00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:41.464
You can't control what other people are posting and

390
00:17:41.474 --> 00:17:43.484
you can't control what your kids are seeing.

391
00:17:43.655 --> 00:17:47.285
But I believe that like other kids mature at different ages and we can't

392
00:17:47.295 --> 00:17:49.234
really rest like restrict certain people from

393
00:17:49.244 --> 00:17:51.005
going on this platform when it's public.

394
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.030
It's difficult because I,

395
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.109
I do think what you said is true where if I was 13 and someone said you have

396
00:17:59.119 --> 00:18:01.969
to be 13 to get on this app or you or like you have to be older,

397
00:18:01.979 --> 00:18:03.010
I would have lied about my,

398
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.369
my age and I know there are millions of kids like that that are like, he, he,

399
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.410
he break the system and be, like, put in a different age.

400
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.050
-- See,
-- that's the thing with any problem.

401
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.530
You can't just take the problem and move it over here.

402
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:17.810
It's all about the education. It should be a class, like how sex ed is,

403
00:18:18.069 --> 00:18:21.439
-- there should be like tech ed, like
-- computer lab days exist.

404
00:18:21.449 --> 00:18:24.219
Like, was that just my school? Like, there were computer lab days or something?

405
00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:24.790
We

406
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.619
just practice typing

407
00:18:25.729 --> 00:18:28.270
when you practice typing, like, instead of just practicing typing,

408
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.189
practice how to not be an idiot online and, like, how to, like, learn and understand,

409
00:18:32.199 --> 00:18:35.479
like, the harm of it because, like, if I had that education,

410
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.699
I know that, like, I would have, like, at

411
00:18:37.819 --> 00:18:39.530
least braced myself for it

412
00:18:40.949 --> 00:18:45.150
once COVID kinda hit I realized like, I need social media

413
00:18:45.329 --> 00:18:47.750
or else I can't, like, find anyone.

414
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.719
I know some people that kind of think, like,

415
00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:51.750
when I say that I don't use social media a lot, they're like, oh,

416
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.989
do you think you're cooler than us because you don't need, like,

417
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.430
social media validation?

418
00:18:55.829 --> 00:18:56.270
But

419
00:18:56.439 --> 00:19:02.069
it's more like I'm afraid of if I search for that validation that I'm not gonna get it.

420
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.859
Social media

421
00:19:05.569 --> 00:19:06.800
more than my school heart.

422
00:19:10.589 --> 00:19:10.680
Yes.

423
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:17.489
I know all schools they don't talk about some deep topics that social media brings

424
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.430
to light and it teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it

425
00:19:20.439 --> 00:19:23.560
and how to do it without talking to your family if you are uncomfortable and

426
00:19:23.569 --> 00:19:25.719
without talking to the school because sometimes

427
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:27.469
schools don't have that education in place.

428
00:19:27.479 --> 00:19:28.979
-- My
-- teacher told everyone

429
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.910
that Rupaul's drag race was a good example of trans people.

430
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.469
Of course, like I got in trouble for like, correcting him or whatever,

431
00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:40.640
but it was like, I could not let him spread fake information like that.

432
00:19:40.875 --> 00:19:42.875
Those are not trans people, those are drag queens.

433
00:19:42.885 --> 00:19:47.655
And that is a totally different topic. I'm very far in my transition for 16 and

434
00:19:47.824 --> 00:19:50.694
it social media definitely helped me a lot.

435
00:19:51.074 --> 00:19:55.405
And then the fact that you even got in trouble for that shows that school is that like,

436
00:19:55.415 --> 00:19:56.614
you know, they're lacking,

437
00:19:56.785 --> 00:19:58.775
-- you
-- know, personal experience is how you learn the most, you know,

438
00:19:58.785 --> 00:20:02.395
you go on social media and there's someone talking about this eating disorder,

439
00:20:02.405 --> 00:20:03.834
this depression that they went to.

440
00:20:03.844 --> 00:20:05.994
It's just someone actually talking to a camera giving you

441
00:20:06.005 --> 00:20:07.854
real advice that a school really can never do.

442
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.510
I wanna preface it with. I am kind of like, I'm very lucky.

443
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.449
Um The school that I go to Altamont is

444
00:20:15.459 --> 00:20:18.030
like a private school in Alabama and they're very,

445
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.550
very good with kind of integrating

446
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.910
these conversations into the academic dialogue.

447
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.000
I, I totally agree with everything y'all have said.

448
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.040
I've learned how to Rainbow Loom and I've

449
00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.189
done a bunch of different things on social media

450
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.750
but I've also looked up like election

451
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.180
and there's been misinformation after misinformation and with COVID.

452
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.869
So

453
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.589
for y'all that answered, how do you,

454
00:20:36.694 --> 00:20:39.555
how you kind of outweigh like the chance to learn a bunch of new things,

455
00:20:39.564 --> 00:20:42.594
but also the chance of seeing a lot of stuff that isn't necessarily true.

456
00:20:42.645 --> 00:20:44.915
-- I
-- think you just have to look for credible websites.

457
00:20:44.925 --> 00:20:46.795
I mean, it's just like when you're doing an essay, you wouldn't

458
00:20:46.964 --> 00:20:50.165
believe. I, I just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff.

459
00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:52.094
It is easy to get a lot of misinformation,

460
00:20:52.104 --> 00:20:54.334
but it's also easy to see that this information is fake.

461
00:20:54.344 --> 00:20:57.084
-- Like, but
-- what about like a young kid that can't really discern that?

462
00:20:57.094 --> 00:20:57.954
-- Because I feel like
-- that's the,

463
00:20:57.964 --> 00:21:02.515
my dad actually um put the Washington Post and the New York Times

464
00:21:02.729 --> 00:21:04.880
on my phone so that I would look at it more.

465
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.439
So I would get the notifications, you know, all I had to do was put it on my phone.

466
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.920
There have been times when I've disagreed with what the teacher said

467
00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:11.640
and

468
00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:12.939
that that is true.

469
00:21:12.949 --> 00:21:16.599
But I also think that with social media, with the algorithm in place,

470
00:21:16.609 --> 00:21:18.650
it's harder to harder like to discern,

471
00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.160
-- I disagree with you
-- just because I feel like as kids,

472
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.900
we look up to our teachers for the right answers and if they are

473
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.800
like providing like a bias answer,

474
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.160
-- we're getting the wrong information.
-- If you've taken

475
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:28.430
a

476
00:21:28.744 --> 00:21:29.604
science class

477
00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:32.785
there will be times where the teacher's own political beliefs

478
00:21:32.795 --> 00:21:36.165
might make the learning bias so comparable to social media.

479
00:21:36.175 --> 00:21:37.244
It's about the same. Yeah.

480
00:21:37.255 --> 00:21:39.244
-- But I
-- think it's more dangerous on social media because I,

481
00:21:39.255 --> 00:21:40.944
I agree it is very dangerous in the classroom,

482
00:21:40.954 --> 00:21:43.165
especially when you look up to teachers with the algorithm.

483
00:21:43.175 --> 00:21:46.125
They don't have that humanity for to like to actually discern like, oh,

484
00:21:46.135 --> 00:21:49.145
this is an article about how masks aren't important.

485
00:21:49.165 --> 00:21:51.204
So like, but I'm gonna pump that out.

486
00:21:51.594 --> 00:21:52.035
But I would

487
00:21:52.385 --> 00:21:54.334
just, I would disagree with you for that exact

488
00:21:54.469 --> 00:21:55.489
reason because

489
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.510
because it's just one human, one way of life, one perspective, one thought,

490
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.069
you know, but at least when you go on social media and you put up Trump,

491
00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:03.890
it's gonna come up both sides of the story, you know,

492
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.089
when it's up to you to differentiate and read it and see, OK,

493
00:22:06.099 --> 00:22:09.089
-- this comes from this credible website and this is coming from a blog on
-- Wikipedia.

494
00:22:09.099 --> 00:22:10.079
What if we're talking about like,

495
00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:12.890
just a straightforward thing like math science or English?

496
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.229
Sometimes you can get like a cruddy teacher and they won't really teach you that.

497
00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:18.089
Well, you just type that into social media.

498
00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.619
They ring it.

499
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.449
I've never

500
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.209
like, I've never

501
00:22:20.564 --> 00:22:23.864
been held by a math teacher. I mean, photo math was the only thing that helped me.

502
00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:25.805
I mean, and it's not even like it only gave me the answers.

503
00:22:25.814 --> 00:22:26.005
I mean,

504
00:22:26.015 --> 00:22:28.224
you saw like you scrolled up and it literally shows you step

505
00:22:28.234 --> 00:22:30.015
by step what it does and you look for the reasoning,

506
00:22:30.025 --> 00:22:30.954
here's the reasoning.

507
00:22:30.964 --> 00:22:34.055
-- And sometimes
-- if I have a lot of trouble with like an assignment or something,

508
00:22:34.064 --> 00:22:36.724
I'll actually like post a picture of it and I'll be like, hey,

509
00:22:36.734 --> 00:22:38.655
like I am really bad in this subject.

510
00:22:38.665 --> 00:22:42.334
Every single time people do message me and help me out or like we comment and be like,

511
00:22:42.344 --> 00:22:46.074
hey, like actually this is what you're doing wrong and this is how you do it right?

512
00:22:47.329 --> 00:22:49.270
Society would thrive

513
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:50.910
without social.

514
00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:54.430
I don't know if

515
00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:54.599
we

516
00:22:58.109 --> 00:22:59.569
for me on a macro scale,

517
00:22:59.579 --> 00:23:03.819
I think there are some really um troubling signs that social media is kind

518
00:23:03.829 --> 00:23:08.459
of unwinding society and humanity in the sense of like the democracy debate,

519
00:23:08.469 --> 00:23:12.050
governments can use social media to then kind of undermine elections.

520
00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:15.140
Um And I think those are bigger issues when you look at the macro scale.

521
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.339
But again, on the micro scale,

522
00:23:16.349 --> 00:23:18.420
-- there are so many different people in the world that
-- would thrive with it.

523
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.819
I know other people that are like me,

524
00:23:19.829 --> 00:23:23.660
I think I would thrive more without social media because I kind of I compare

525
00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:26.696
myself and I look for those likes and look for those comments on my posts.

526
00:23:26.706 --> 00:23:29.926
And I feel like if I didn't have that concern my mental health and my self love and

527
00:23:29.936 --> 00:23:32.855
self image would be so much better if I didn't see all this stuff on the internet.

528
00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:36.586
But part of me wants to ask for like a def a definition for like thrive because like,

529
00:23:36.595 --> 00:23:37.786
are we talking about like

530
00:23:37.936 --> 00:23:40.676
us as like a human race or like people

531
00:23:40.686 --> 00:23:43.595
individually Instagram and things and like put like make

532
00:23:43.605 --> 00:23:46.145
you have poor body image and this that but also like in the case of like Alex,

533
00:23:46.156 --> 00:23:47.475
you know, it helps him, you know,

534
00:23:47.485 --> 00:23:50.891
meet other trans people and understand that like he isn't alone, right?

535
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:51.771
And so it,

536
00:23:51.781 --> 00:23:55.491
it's such a general question with so many variables that

537
00:23:55.501 --> 00:23:57.732
like you can't just like put one answer down.

538
00:23:57.741 --> 00:23:57.812
Yeah,

539
00:23:57.822 --> 00:24:00.631
-- you need so
-- case by case you need to know if it's on the micro macro

540
00:24:00.671 --> 00:24:01.291
scale and you know,

541
00:24:01.302 --> 00:24:03.741
like Alex is a following that is a lot of other trans kids that are

542
00:24:03.751 --> 00:24:06.411
looking for other trans kids and if Alex just went mi a for a month,

543
00:24:06.421 --> 00:24:09.891
people would panic, you know, and like, you know, like I can totally like,

544
00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:13.102
sorry to like keep using you but like, like this is like the easiest like,

545
00:24:13.112 --> 00:24:14.271
like analogy, right?

546
00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:15.371
I'm sorry, Alex,

547
00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:16.770
I love

548
00:24:17.329 --> 00:24:17.349
it.

549
00:24:17.569 --> 00:24:17.699
I was

550
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.810
-- like, this is just like the
-- easiest example.

551
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.369
Um I have a question actually.

552
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.609
Um so I, in the recent months,

553
00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:26.670
especially there have been a lot of protests and stuff that were

554
00:24:26.939 --> 00:24:31.130
like a lot of them were created online and I think that if we didn't have social media,

555
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.449
a lot of them wouldn't have been possible because

556
00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:36.569
there wouldn't have been the word spread so fast.

557
00:24:36.579 --> 00:24:39.979
I, I agree. Yes. These protests got really big and it's really important.

558
00:24:39.989 --> 00:24:40.810
But I,

559
00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:42.829
the thing that I've kind of been looking at is the

560
00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:44.510
people that go and take a picture and they like,

561
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.660
oh my God, like, I, I'm so supportive and like, they change their profile picture.

562
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.770
They do the blackout Tuesday and then a week later

563
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.910
it gets archived when people go with like professional grade cameras

564
00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.270
and like bring a hair and makeup team to like sit

565
00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.869
there and like pose in the middle of the street.

566
00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.569
-- Like it's less of the movement and more of the social
-- media and yeah,

567
00:25:01.579 --> 00:25:04.550
and I think that's also a perspective thing because I think there was maybe one or two

568
00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.550
major influencers who were dumb enough to take a

569
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.359
production team out there to take a picture.

570
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.650
And I think that was for people like you

571
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.020
guys who are antisocial media to focus be like,

572
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.670
wow, see, look at all these influencers.

573
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.630
It's the whole entire community is just like them.

574
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.439
And I was in New York for a couple of

575
00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.250
days and I was in like Washington Square or something.

576
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.579
They were passing out flyers like, hey,

577
00:25:20.589 --> 00:25:22.479
share this on your Snapchat if you know anyone in New York

578
00:25:22.489 --> 00:25:24.040
and I wasn't only in New York for like two days,

579
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.660
but I posted it and I got like, I don't know,

580
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.560
like 40,000 people on Snapchat to watch it and be, and if they were in New York,

581
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:30.560
-- they could
-- go by these like, performative parts.

582
00:25:30.569 --> 00:25:33.140
I'm not talking, only influencers like, yes, that is a big part.

583
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.469
And it is very troublesome when influencers do, like, kind of go out and like,

584
00:25:36.479 --> 00:25:39.349
pose for like the picture rather than for the protest.

585
00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:39.869
But

586
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:40.790
when

587
00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.270
people kind of seeing like, oh,

588
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.150
this is trendy and when people have that desire to like go viral,

589
00:25:46.239 --> 00:25:47.790
-- they'll go out and they'll do
-- it.

590
00:25:47.829 --> 00:25:50.430
But here's like a scenario. What if um me,

591
00:25:50.689 --> 00:25:52.839
Alex, I mean, Alex, Alex and Alexa,

592
00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:57.880
we all just teamed up, we did like a charity stream and then donated to, let's say,

593
00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.880
let's, let's just throw back to like early 2020 whether it was like fires

594
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:02.859
wouldn't

595
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.930
California or Australia thrive from us donating.

596
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.089
I do agree that um social media does like,

597
00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:13.280
promote awareness and it helps change and definitely in our societies,

598
00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.430
everyone's on social media.

599
00:26:14.439 --> 00:26:17.280
So if they see this and it gets spread, it's gonna make change. Yeah.

600
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.609
And that's kind of why I made like the log off movement is

601
00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:22.560
because I saw that there was this multifaceted nature about social media and

602
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.969
at least just wanted to discuss it with teens and to be like,

603
00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:27.170
let's figure out how to exist in a healthier way.

604
00:26:27.329 --> 00:26:30.410
And um even though social media, we can talk about the good and the bad all day,

605
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.849
it's just nice to be in one space and have one conversation.

606
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:34.609
I mean, yeah, technically, social media did bring us here.

607
00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:37.790
So I guess that's a good thing. Like, hey, we don't have to talk about that.

608
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.520
Hi, everyone. Wish you a very happy New Year and hope you enjoyed this episode.

609
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:50.359
I personally struggle a lot with my social media usage.

610
00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.819
So recently I bought an alarm clock so that the phone

611
00:26:52.829 --> 00:26:54.810
is not the first thing I look at in the morning and

612
00:26:54.819 --> 00:26:57.010
I'm not tempted to go on social media if you have

613
00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.359
any suggestions as to how you control your social media usage,

614
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.290
feel free to leave in the comments section below.

615
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.359
And thanks for watching.
