1,spk_7,12.2845,14.34716667,"Hey, do you want to be quiet? We, were trying to pit the sharks. All right. All right. Ah, thats better. Thats better. Try to go. Hi, Sharks. Im Anthony Pucci and Im Nick Pucci. Were from Los Angeles, California and were seeking $350,000 for 10% equity in our company sharks. Its probably been some time since you worked in a cubicle or even sat in an open office desk. But did you know most offices today feature an open design plan while its great for collaboration and cutting costs, most employees are less productive because of it and thats because employees are dissatisfied with their work environment. In fact, a lack of sound and visual privacy is by far and away. The biggest strain on employee morale introducing cubic call at um the modern phone booth cubicle is the efficient solution to the shortcomings of the design of modern day offices. Our booth focuses on the four pillars of privacy needs, audio, visual, territorial and information. So distractions like these girl become a thing of the past and our cubicle booths are fully customizable. They can be finished in a variety of colors, materials and even custom graphics and those by folding doors allow cubicle to fit into offices where every inch of space is critical. So sharks invest in us so we can help employers invest in their employees. Which one of you wanna come down and get a privacy break from Mr Wonderful and test drive one of the, I wanna try it. Let me thank you. No, we are not doing this again. Oh, sorry. Excuse me? Oh, wow. There you go. Its, its really, well, were you saying anything inside Robert? You cant hear a thing in there. You can hear"
2,spk_6,14.37148333,14.3805,whats going on
3,spk_5,14.38333333,14.467,"guys. Its, it works. Its,"
4,spk_7,14.5075,14.82833333,"ah, can you guys hear them ba, each booth comes with an air circulation fan, comes with a regular outlet so you can plug in a laptop and two USB chargers.  Why dont you walk us
 through the numbers? So we sell the first one there, which is our cubicle two. We sell it for 6009 95. Oh,"
5,spk_5,14.846,14.92148333," $10,000. And what does it cost you to make? It
 cost us $4200 to make?"
6,spk_7,14.94231667,14.99765,"And how about the big one? The big one is 11,009 95."
7,spk_5,15.01066667,15.05915," What was the cost of the 11 K 1?
 That ones 7200?"
8,spk_7,15.07031667,16.02681667,"Now, wait a minute. The competition are relative to that. Theyre selling theirs for about $15,000. So, Nick, how did you start? The company? Tell us? So, we started our own marketing agency. It was an open plan office and its a family business. So were Italian So we talk very excitedly. We come on just got to the point where any important calls or any meetings that we had, we either had to leave the office to take it. We had to stay, stay home. I said, we cant deal with this anymore. And after we put in our office and clients came in, they said, hey, can you give me one of these? I said, yeah, sure. Once you deliver it, do you just simply plug it in? And it works because they do have to be assembled as far as we actually have a video if you guys wanna see it. Yeah, its quickly being assembled. You guys, right? With a little practice. Yeah. Ships flat. Its super easy to assemble. Nick. Have you sold a bunch of them already? Yes, we have, we sold about 70 booths. We sold your sales last 12 months, uh last 12 months, $495,000."
9,spk_2,16.03366667,16.06831667,And when did you start the business?
10,spk_5,16.07116667,16.1,Last August? How are you selling it
11,spk_7,16.10781667,16.16548333,"uh  directly direct to the end user online? I like the
 solution."
12,spk_5,16.16566667,16.47316667,"But theres a huge problem here. Youre making $1800 on the six K version. Your margins are so thin that the only way this business works is selling direct to customers. Yeah, but this, this is working for them. Why would they end up working guys? Its not working. Youve only sold $495,000 in business for a year."
13,spk_7,16.49283333,17.20683333,"How do you feel about the margins? Can you widen your margins? We definitely can. If we get the investment able to invest in the inventory, well be able to add another 20 to 30%. Whats the vision? Whats year two gonna look like? I mean, we wanna get to $2.5 million next year. Thats about 300 booths. And we think with an investment, we can definitely do that. Do  you have
 competition right now? In the whole market? Theres probably about four competitors that we compete with. Nobody does a bi fold door. It sounds trivial, but youre putting these in because space is an issue. Ok. That makes sense. Yeah, but you dont think that a steel case could come in and undercut all of the parts of this and bring the price down by 50%. I think they could, but they wont hit these price points in these margins. I find that hard to believe."
14,spk_5,17.24281667,17.67606667,"But congratulations on what youve accomplished. Its, its great, obviously, but Ive got a couple of issues. One, its capital intensive two when youre just getting started. Its not unusual, particularly for some when youre cheaper to get orders direct online. But I think youre gonna have to go to some, some other type of two tier contribution. That doesnt mean it wont be a great business for you two, it just means its harder to invest and harder to get a return. And so for those reasons outs,  congratulations
 on"
15,spk_7,17.69208333,17.88323333,"it. You know, youre a niche within a larger furniture market. I think this is a highly competitive industry and I just dont know how youre gonna break into it."
16,spk_2,17.91831667,18.13416667,"I totally get it. My only problem is there are competition out there that are already doing it. And so I think Im gonna wait a really long time for a return on my investment. So, unfortunately, Im a"
17,spk_7,18.15233333,18.43898333,"ok, thank you. We appreciate it, appreciate it. I mean, just to sort of paint the picture. So they do say that 80% of all offices are open plan offices. Now, by estimates, theres maybe about 9.1 million businesses, you know, in the US. If we were even to sell one booth to point 1/10 of 1% of those businesses,"
18,spk_5,18.43948333,18.77448333,"everybody says that about a big market. Yes, thats a kiss of death on the shark tank. When you say all you need is 1/10 of 1%. That thats never a good sign. Im gonna make you an offer but its commensurate with the risk. Ok? Ill give you 350,000. I want 10% of the company. Heres how I get paid back."
19,spk_2,18.77465,18.83648333,"You realize they came in asking for 10%.  Im
 not finished yet."
20,spk_5,18.84633333,19.21766667,"Silence, please. Every time you sell one of these units, I get $100 after I recover 1,050,000, which is three times on the original investment, it drops to $50 a unit forever. Just what you want in a low margin business. Look, its commensurate with the risk here. Maybe Barbara can do better. Anthony.  You gotta be
 careful. Kevin is a vampire. Hell live forever."
21,spk_7,19.22116667,19.49965,"So $50 is gonna last a long time. I have a lot of experience with this. Surprisingly, heres my offer. Its better than his. I think this is so complicated. I dont know what it meant. Its pretty simple, but Im gonna give you the 350,000 for 25% of the business."
22,spk_5,19.53566667,19.87865,"Wait, wait. Ouch. Thats much worse than my office. Are you kidding me? Every dollar that comes in, you get 100 bucks and you get triple mine reduces over time. Mark Barbaras forever 25% of the company, you know, Barbara, you $50. Thats very expensive. What do you wanna do? I do now?"
23,spk_0,19.90033333,20.00998333,Sharks are out. Nick and Anthony have two offers on the table from Kevin and Barbara for their office booth company. Cubicle.
24,spk_5,20.03183333,20.1065," What do you wanna do? What do
 you wanna do right now? I want to go in the booth. We can hear you."
25,spk_7,20.14481667,20.16815,"You wanna go, well go talk to Booth."
26,spk_2,20.19266667,20.33281667,"Ah, this is hilarious. Theyre using the calculator."
27,spk_5,20.34548333,20.37848333,"Oh, Lord, welcome back."
28,spk_7,20.39765,20.66865,"Did you guys hear us by each other? Ok. What did you guys figure out? So, Kevin, we really appreciate your offer. Uh, its a little too difficult for me to figure out and for the eventual sell of the company,  its not
 a problem when you sell the company because they just buy out my royalty."
29,spk_5,20.66883333,20.77865,"Thats what happens. Many of my companies thats happened. $1 billion go on a little  too
 complicated. So, Barbara,"
30,spk_7,20.78966667,21.36883333,"we would like to counter with 350 for 15%. Its uh not enough. Im afraid Ill have to turn that down. Yeah, I expect to do a lot of heavy lifting on this business and I have tremendous contacts in the contract furniture space and I think I can make the right introductions for you. Cant budge on the equity at all. Uh No, because I wanna be excited about it. What do you wanna do? How about, could we do 450 for 20? No, I really, I feel like I need that quarter slice to get really juiced up about it."
31,spk_5,21.38416667,21.54315,"Maybe you should revisit my offer because it has merit actually should think about. It doesnt sound like shes gonna budge  Anthony.
 I dont think these guys are budging. What are you guys gonna do?"
32,spk_7,21.55398333,22.05331667,"What do you want now? Yeah. Ok, Barbara, wed like to take the deal. Good move. Its a good deal for everybody. Thank you. I appreciate it. My pleasure. Thank you. I appreciate it. I think we got a great shark and Barbara with her contacts. I think its gonna do wonders for our business. I see the point with the risk but I think its, I think were gonna do great with it."
