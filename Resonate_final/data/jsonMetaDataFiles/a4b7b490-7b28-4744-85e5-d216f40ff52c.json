    "meeting_summary": "This meeting was about the design of the new remote control product. Firstly, the group discussed the market requirements of the product: young people would like to have a high-tech design with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market. Next, they talked about the working design of their product: it would be a remote control with LCD screen and voice recognition. Lastly, they discussed the product requirements: the remote control would be good-looking, easy to use, and would be priced at twelve fifty Euros."
