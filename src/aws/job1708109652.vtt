0
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.789
I guess I'll start with my presentation. We had two groups of people working on this.

1
00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:04.340
So

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.429
we'll show you two slightly different presentations.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.529
Feel free to ask any questions or comments. Obviously,

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.630
um The first one

5
00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.789
was done by myself, Bruno Marianne and Nikos.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.489
And the rationale that we have, I'll show you the layout in a second

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.329
was that full professors would get private offices.

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.809
Administration is close to the professor's offices.

9
00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.129
So it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone.

10
00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:30.850
The fax is in the administration office since it's mostly used by

11
00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.389
Gisela,

12
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.119
who's the secretary for noise reduction purposes.

13
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.580
We've moved everyone who has office hours

14
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.659
together

15
00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.200
and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall.

16
00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.740
Um So I'll just show you how that works.

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.000
Basically, you can see

18
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.479
Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine.

19
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.840
And Maggie and Susan, who a re the two full professors

20
00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:53.349
and our department have the private offices

21
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.490
and the photocopier and the printer,

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.909
a re sort of in the hall on the side there across from the mailboxes.

23
00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:03.650
Um Just to go back, most people a re grouped in projects

24
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.889
and we have 2 50% people who a re half time in Geneva, half time A T, the Epflin Lausanne

25
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.000
and they, then we've put in three person offices so that in the three person offices,

26
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.910
it's not constantly three people.

27
00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.709
So there's a little bit of give there

28
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.760
and the reading room or the lounge as some people

29
00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:22.870
call it that we have is in a central position.

30
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.209
So basically, we've got Andre and Nancy A T the top.

31
00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:32.279
Um, they don't act, they will be starting a new project together if, um,

32
00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:33.550
if I'm not mistaken,

33
00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:37.540
like I said, Susan and Maggie in the individual offices, Nikos

34
00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.290
and Yalina who work on the SA me project A T the bottom,

35
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.809
the reading room is in the middle.

36
00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.190
Um Marianne and Bruno

37
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.419
A

38
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.730
reat the bottom. Um, as well. Marianne works closely with Pierre

39
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.610
and the other Marianne. We have two Marianne in our department

40
00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:57.260
and David is a half time. So as I said, the half times are in the three person offices.

41
00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.459
And on the other side,

42
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.550
we have Maria Martin and myself who all work on the same project and Martin is 50%.

43
00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:07.269
Um

44
00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:12.839
Gisela, we've given her a two person office for two reasons. One is

45
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.589
because there's a spare place there. So if we want to put

46
00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:15.789
a

47
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.039
tie

48
00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.500
or someone who just comes in for a short period of time,

49
00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.199
we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office, which is a little bit noisy

50
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.669
because they're only there for a short period of time.

51
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.750
Um, and again, the proximity to the other offices.

52
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.320
Um,

53
00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.240
so I guess that's pretty much it

54
00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:36.119
for

55
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.520
our proposal.

56
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:39.029
Um,

57
00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.350
I don't know if you want Andre to go through

58
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.610
his first or if you have any questions for me.

59
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.679
So you said so

60
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.960
Pierre

61
00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:45.449
is a professor,

62
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.419
but

63
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.279
she's only,

64
00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:50.279
she's only 50% time. Is

65
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.550
that why

66
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.820
it's,

67
00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:54.679
do you wanna explain how

68
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.720
Martin

69
00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:55.960
is?

70
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.070
50%

71
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.600
Martin

72
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.449
is 50%

73
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.990
pure?

74
00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.100
There's two sort of statutes

75
00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.259
-- of professor, I guess you could say,
-- well,

76
00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.580
because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that.

77
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.520
But

78
00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:09.020
um

79
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.789
yeah,

80
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.130
and

81
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.940
the,

82
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.270
yeah, they a re full professors and assistant professors if you want.

83
00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.380
And yeah, it's true that she's an assistant professor. But uh,

84
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.580
well, we see maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh,

85
00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:28.350
well, also a t least, maybe not a

86
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.220
uh an office alone but a t least with just one person, not two.

87
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.880
-- But the
-- idea is Maggie and Susan, a re sort of the senior

88
00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.259
um professors on staff. So they got the,

89
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.309
the individual offices

90
00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.460
and what, what's happening,

91
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.789
what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years?

92
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.149
Like beyond this,

93
00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.869
beyond this current group of people, do we, do we know of any changes coming?

94
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.350
-- Is the department growing
-- or

95
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.869
um,

96
00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:59.740
the department will obviously be growing.

97
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.949
But there's some people who only work part time.

98
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.509
There's some people who are doing phd S or master students

99
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.539
who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time.

100
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.330
So for Exa M

101
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.050
Yelena and the Finnish Marianne, a re master students

102
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.410
for right now, so whether they decide to stay and do a phd,

103
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.950
we're not sure yet.

104
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.880
Um Nikos

105
00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:20.869
is working um as a researcher.

106
00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.209
So for him, it's the same thing. There's,

107
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.799
I think the only

108
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.489
constant people are Susan, Maggie Andre,

109
00:04:31.369 --> 00:04:32.279
um

110
00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:33.059
Gisela

111
00:04:33.829 --> 00:04:34.029
Pet.

112
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.070
Um And all the rest are either phd students or master students.

113
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
And again, Martin and David are half time with the BFL. So

114
00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:47.089
that's project dependent as well.

115
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.350
Unfortunately, we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked, but

116
00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:56.869
that's always the case.

117
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.579
And have you,

118
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.220
have you talked to any of these people to ask them if they have any

119
00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:07.679
special requirements?

120
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.880
Um, Susan wanted a private office. She has a preference for private offices.

121
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.350
Other than that,

122
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.220
-- no one really had any tight constraints from what I've
-- heard of people.

123
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.230
They needed to be

124
00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:24.429
near or people they needed to avoid or

125
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.029
no one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else.

126
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.070
But you've given people a chance to say that if they really needed to.

127
00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:33.859
Okay, good.

128
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.549
But even no specific views f or mountains or old town or,

129
00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:42.049
I mean, people prefer any windows.

130
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.820
No, and they were fine with it.

131
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.660
And they're both nice views.

132
00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.390
I

133
00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:52.109
-- guess those thin lines, a re, I mean, their windows or, yeah,
-- their windows.

134
00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:55.980
Oh, sorry, the thick lines, a re windows actually

135
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.660
we have fairly big windows.

136
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.700
Yeah. Yeah. So there's lots of light coming in

137
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.399
and one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it

138
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.149
was is that you have a lot of light coming in.

139
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.529
So people just go somewhere to sort of relax and

140
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.369
-- have a quiet places. They have a lot of light. It says
-- mountains. Is that because

141
00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:14.890
that's the view.

142
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.109
-- So it's the best of you. You gave the reading room the best of
-- you.

143
00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:18.529
Yeah.

144
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.130
Well, I mean, it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral

145
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.904
could sort of go both ways. But,

146
00:06:24.084 --> 00:06:27.084
yeah, we've got two mountain views, sort of on that side, that side.

147
00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:29.424
And then the last part looks on the old town

148
00:06:29.554 --> 00:06:32.225
because we're on the sixth floor. You can actually see everything.

149
00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:34.625
I don't think buildings a re much higher than,

150
00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:36.385
-- what was it? Six or eight
-- floors.

151
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:37.225
Just

152
00:06:37.804 --> 00:06:38.154
so,

153
00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:40.144
-- what's a purple thing
-- there?

154
00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:41.954
The purple thing is the mailboxes

155
00:06:42.614 --> 00:06:44.845
and those a re fixed. We can't do anything about those.

156
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:54.760
So you can't do any partitions. I mean, you're planning to do any partitions in three

157
00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.410
persons

158
00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:56.290
and rooms or

159
00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.510
these

160
00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.190
kind of block.

161
00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:00.920
We don't have anything like that.

162
00:07:00.929 --> 00:07:04.859
If we can get stuff like that, it might be a good idea. Some people might like them.

163
00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:07.079
A t the moment we have people thre sharing

164
00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.279
like three people in our room without any partitions and

165
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.929
it's a little bit noisy but

166
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.880
people sort of get used to it. And

167
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.760
admittedly it's mostly assistants that a re stuck in rooms like that. So it's

168
00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:21.350
junior people.

169
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.399
But,

170
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.769
um,

171
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.390
well, I can think of some reactions from the people. So maybe I can.

172
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.600
-- Do
-- you wanna do your

173
00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:32.609
presentation? Yeah.

174
00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:36.670
Well, tell me about some of the constraints and, well, first of all, I must say that

175
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.410
there a re also quite a lot of common points. So, um,

176
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.309
it's probably not going to be very difficult to.

177
00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:45.799
Yeah, please. Thanks.

178
00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:47.109
Perfect.

179
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.500
So, um, yeah, actually, we, um,

180
00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:53.480
well, basically the, the group who produced this, uh,

181
00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:58.989
proposal was made by Susan Martin David and, uh, and myself

182
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:04.399
and we also, well, Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they,

183
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.519
they felt about sharing offices.

184
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:07.149
And, uh,

185
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.529
so as you can see, well, um, Susan gets obviously the SA ME office,

186
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.079
which is quite a good thing.

187
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:15.470
Um,

188
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:20.429
then things start to move a bit. It looks like I'm also in the SA Me position.

189
00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:24.799
But the most obvious constraints that uh we, we found here was that

190
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.540
it was probably very difficult to have a lounge, uh,

191
00:08:27.609 --> 00:08:33.558
just a lounge in one room because it would block us two full working places.

192
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.289
And although it's true that the group, I agree, decided to, to have to have a lounge.

193
00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.530
We propose to put the lounge, uh, in the room. A t the, the upper side on, on the right.

194
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.859
Uh, so let two people share this with, uh, sort of, uh, yeah, a place where we have, uh,

195
00:08:50.869 --> 00:08:53.530
a sofa maybe and, uh, and some books.

196
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.450
So it's obviously a calm place. People a re not there to talk very loud,

197
00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:01.809
but they can sit and relax and still look a tat the mountains.

198
00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:05.729
Um Also, so that's one of the main differences.

199
00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:08.479
I think maybe one of the points that we have to talk about.

200
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.280
Uh The other one is the admin office. So it's written Gisella

201
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.030
50% because she's only half time and uh the fax machine,

202
00:09:17.409 --> 00:09:18.130
um

203
00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:18.599
Gisele

204
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.799
actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's

205
00:09:21.809 --> 00:09:25.419
true that her activity is quite noisy when she is there.

206
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.950
Um It's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the,

207
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.989
the projects actually that we manage.

208
00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:37.539
So it appeared a t least to, well to our group that even if she's here only half time,

209
00:09:37.549 --> 00:09:40.130
she should have an office by her own because

210
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.840
it would be quite disturbing for other people to,

211
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.849
to work in the, the Sa me office.

212
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.489
Uh

213
00:09:45.979 --> 00:09:48.549
Gisela is has no objection against sharing the office.

214
00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:51.510
We thought it was more for the, the calm of the, the people

215
00:09:51.809 --> 00:09:55.150
it's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms.

216
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.070
But uh on the other hand, uh Maggie has no objection.

217
00:09:59.109 --> 00:10:01.520
Uh sharing an office with her assistant

218
00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:04.309
and this appeared to be true. Also, of Pierrette,

219
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.429
we don't know about Pierrette,

220
00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:10.450
sharing an office with two persons, but a t least no problem

221
00:10:10.669 --> 00:10:11.030
in Pierrette

222
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.919
sharing her office with uh Marian,

223
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.330
the Swedish one who is

224
00:10:15.619 --> 00:10:16.909
her assistant.

225
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.950
Um So this is why we, yeah, we put Maggie with, with Bruno

226
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.179
and then

227
00:10:24.969 --> 00:10:26.710
the third main difference

228
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.289
uh would be the, the number of visitor places or free places.

229
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:36.580
Uh You notice a new na me in the room uh A t the centre, upper, upper side.

230
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.590
So that's Paula.

231
00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:40.750
It's true that it's someone coming next year.

232
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.960
Susan reminded me this uh of this point and I could not really ignore it.

233
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.140
Uh So, um

234
00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.400
this, she is in Italic. She will arrive in about two months

235
00:10:50.809 --> 00:10:51.659
and the two

236
00:10:51.849 --> 00:10:54.340
vis one and vis two A re the visitor places

237
00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:57.390
you had one I think called free space or spare,

238
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.429
spare place.

239
00:10:58.929 --> 00:11:00.989
Um We didn't really reach a very good

240
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.099
agreement on the distribution of these two rooms.

241
00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:05.619
So the, the two A T the center

242
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:06.989
uh where is there,

243
00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:07.609
Paula,

244
00:11:07.859 --> 00:11:10.590
Yalina, the two visitors and then Maria plus David.

245
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.940
So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit

246
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:16.419
among the people

247
00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:19.869
just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate.

248
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.320
So not to have one empty room when we have no visitors.

249
00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:28.109
Um And uh then a very full room when everybody is here.

250
00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:31.289
So I think we were, we a re quite willing to split and put,

251
00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:33.419
say maybe one visitor with Maria

252
00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:38.330
and David, uh 50% in the other room with the second visitor. So that

253
00:11:38.659 --> 00:11:41.619
realistically, we don't actually have that many visitors coming in.

254
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.820
I've been there for almost two years and we've had a couple of

255
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.150
-- stas, but that's
-- it.

256
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.619
Well, yeah, exactly. So the visitors are basically stier

257
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.340
and it happens that sometimes we have two of them,

258
00:11:51.349 --> 00:11:54.140
even if it's only for three or four months,

259
00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:59.674
Martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor, for instance,

260
00:11:59.924 --> 00:12:01.455
we cannot really put him with

261
00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:05.385
Gisella because, well, they wouldn't feel very nice. They, they made the joke.

262
00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:06.585
Yeah.

263
00:12:07.085 --> 00:12:09.635
So we should manage some kind of decent space.

264
00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.815
It's true that these one or two last one or two years,

265
00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:14.835
we didn't have a visiting professor.

266
00:12:15.224 --> 00:12:16.265
But, um,

267
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.140
yeah, so, uh I think, yeah, these a re the three main points.

268
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.400
So one is the place of the lounge.

269
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.450
Uh The other one is the uh the place of the admin office with

270
00:12:27.859 --> 00:12:32.369
Gisela. And the third one is the number of visitor visiting people. And uh,

271
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.659
well, how many of them we want to accommodate?

272
00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:37.729
And where, where we put it, these, I think a re the three main differences.

273
00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:40.229
Otherwise we pretty much agree on, uh,

274
00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:42.049
on placing people.

275
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.289
Oh,

276
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.609
in a way, if that's your argumentation, then put a visiting person with a senior

277
00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:51.690
researcher, at least if not a professor rather than two

278
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.840
students.

279
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.340
Um, sorry,

280
00:12:55.619 --> 00:12:56.609
I, I didn't understand

281
00:12:58.809 --> 00:13:00.809
if you're gonna argue that the visitors a re supposed

282
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.070
to be important and they should have their own space,

283
00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.909
then put them with

284
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.309
another researcher rather than two

285
00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:07.739
students.

286
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.950
Yeah, that's, that's true. I think, yeah, they a re quite open to, to this.

287
00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:14.960
Martin also reminded us that he's quite noisy.

288
00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:18.190
He has a lot of uh phone calls to make even if it's here,

289
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.390
if he's here only 50% of the time.

290
00:13:20.979 --> 00:13:21.799
Um

291
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.820
So, yeah, I, I don't mind this but uh

292
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.429
that's something but it's true. Yeah, we could also

293
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.140
try to put a visitor and the professor

294
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:33.539
um

295
00:13:33.849 --> 00:13:35.510
Martin made another point.

296
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.789
It was the fact that sometimes professor have to

297
00:13:37.799 --> 00:13:41.989
professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing

298
00:13:42.369 --> 00:13:47.590
and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their, well,

299
00:13:47.599 --> 00:13:49.510
in the presence of their phd students

300
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.700
like saying, oh, I, I have to reduce her from 80% to 50%. That's probably something.

301
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:57.390
So, I

302
00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:00.030
mean, all these a re constraints, I don't know how,

303
00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.880
how you would like us to proceed from,

304
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.789
from here or if you already have questions or reactions on this one,

305
00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:09.909
but how often the launch is used? Um

306
00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:12.770
People lose us

307
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.270
-- on a regular basis daily basis or
-- fairly regularly.

308
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.690
There's a t least one or two people in there.

309
00:14:20.299 --> 00:14:20.409
I mean,

310
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.359
it's, yeah,

311
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:24.030
it's a fairly new thing in the department,

312
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.409
but it's being used pretty regularly. It was something that a lot of people wanted.

313
00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:30.929
Just sort of a quiet space out of your office

314
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.140
that doesn't have the office furniture, the office chairs, it sort of has

315
00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:38.700
comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that where you can just go and

316
00:14:38.989 --> 00:14:39.859
relax and,

317
00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:41.700
or if you want to read something for a

318
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.229
longer period of time in a more comfortable environment

319
00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:49.330
-- and because we do a lot of reading and things like that, it does get used fairly
-- often.

320
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.690
So it's not a place for discussion

321
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.200
and

322
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.169
-- we
-- sort of have an open policy where if there's no

323
00:14:56.179 --> 00:14:58.409
one in there and you want to have a discussion,

324
00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:59.330
then that's fine.

325
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.250
But you can't

326
00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.179
displace people who a rein their reading

327
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.619
just because you want to have a mini meeting or whatever.

328
00:15:07.049 --> 00:15:09.070
So there's no a re you planning some kind

329
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.710
of partition between the lounge and the offices or

330
00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:14.369
how a re you gonna keep those things,

331
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.260
keep them separate cause it

332
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:17.750
seems like.

333
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.190
Mm Yeah, that's true. That's one of the problems.

334
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.549
Um Well, we were told that it was not really possible to build walls,

335
00:15:25.559 --> 00:15:28.349
but we noticed that this room actually has two doors.

336
00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:32.820
So uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of, well separation

337
00:15:33.109 --> 00:15:33.450
case

338
00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:33.789
or

339
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.859
maybe just yeah, furniture or just uh some kind of screen,

340
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.280
-- but it won't
-- be uh

341
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:43.320
an acoustic separation. No, it's not sound proof. So if, if the

342
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:44.820
those a re students there,

343
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.099
so if they're noisy that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge,

344
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.619
um

345
00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.609
which is sort of why in our proposal, we had it

346
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.530
completely as a separate room

347
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.669
is that if you really want peace and quiet,

348
00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:59.929
you shut the door and when the doors a re shut,

349
00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.979
like, unless someone's making noise right outside the door,

350
00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:04.510
it really is fairly quiet.

351
00:16:06.609 --> 00:16:08.590
But you've also put the lounge in a very k

352
00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:11.549
kind of a high traffic area where the mailboxes,

353
00:16:11.559 --> 00:16:12.070
a re

354
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.219
the printer

355
00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.559
and the

356
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.940
rest rooms. So that's, um,

357
00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:20.359
that may also that, that may be good for

358
00:16:21.469 --> 00:16:23.989
meeting people and bumping into people, but it's

359
00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.789
maybe against the idea if it's a very, supposed to be an isolated quiet spot.

360
00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:33.989
So, yeah. Well, it was actually this pressure from, from my group

361
00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:38.059
that led to this to squeeze a little bit the, the place of the lounge.

362
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:39.690
Now, how for instance,

363
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.780
would the university feel about the room that would be only used as a lounge?

364
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.590
Would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space

365
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.590
or is there no problem. Do you see a problem with having a room just for a lounge or no?

366
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.789
Well, maybe if it,

367
00:16:55.799 --> 00:17:00.530
if it helps us pack more people into the offices because they have a private lounge.

368
00:17:01.059 --> 00:17:02.969
Maybe it's a good thing, saves us money.

369
00:17:04.229 --> 00:17:05.130
-- But,
-- uh,

370
00:17:05.618 --> 00:17:11.209
so we could have a separate room as a lounge. As long as, uh, we pack the other offices.

371
00:17:11.368 --> 00:17:15.630
I guess that's personally, I, I have no problem with this. So, um,

372
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.130
it's, it's fine.

373
00:17:19.239 --> 00:17:19.250
I

374
00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:24.800
mean, I suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have

375
00:17:25.358 --> 00:17:29.430
a lot of people, then you can get rid of the lounge,

376
00:17:29.439 --> 00:17:30.819
figure out what to do with the furniture,

377
00:17:30.829 --> 00:17:33.219
either distribute it between various offices

378
00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:34.660
or,

379
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:35.560
but you

380
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.910
-- put it into storage
-- somewhere.

381
00:17:37.099 --> 00:17:37.160
So

382
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.030
it's not a completely experimental concept.

383
00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:40.959
Has

384
00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:41.109
a

385
00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:41.359
lounge.

386
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.609
This is something that

387
00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:45.719
it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table where

388
00:17:45.729 --> 00:17:47.959
people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon,

389
00:17:47.969 --> 00:17:49.250
they just wanted somewhere to go off.

390
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.469
And

391
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.880
-- so you have some quiet
-- time and

392
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.359
that's where it

393
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:55.569
came from

394
00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.060
there. A re bookshelves in there, but it's not really a library because everyone

395
00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.430
a t the moment everyone has a bookshelf in their office

396
00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:08.579
and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else.

397
00:18:08.589 --> 00:18:11.550
It's more really about having a comfortable place to sit,

398
00:18:12.199 --> 00:18:13.270
um, where

399
00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.910
it's not an office environment, it doesn't look anything like an office.

400
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.910
You mean, you can display some

401
00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:19.500
new

402
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.010
or new.

403
00:18:20.869 --> 00:18:21.040
Yeah.

404
00:18:21.479 --> 00:18:23.359
And people can come in with their stuff or leave

405
00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:26.589
a newspaper or magazine lying around for other people.

406
00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.660
We've got a bulletin board where you can paste up

407
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.949
articles that you think a re interesting for other people.

408
00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:31.329
But

409
00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.160
okay, so I think maybe we can agree on,

410
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.119
on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to,

411
00:18:38.219 --> 00:18:40.329
to find space elsewhere.

412
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.869
What about

413
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:44.770
Gisela? How do you feel about putting her in a

414
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.140
separate office?

415
00:18:47.849 --> 00:18:49.650
Which is the case now, I think

416
00:18:50.209 --> 00:18:50.229
she

417
00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:50.390
has,

418
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.459
-- which is
-- why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to keep her

419
00:18:56.739 --> 00:19:00.680
with a spare person because that's the w the situation it is right now. And

420
00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.180
if you're a stas

421
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.280
and you're coming in, you don't necessarily expect to have

422
00:19:05.699 --> 00:19:08.560
a full blown office if you're only there for about two months.

423
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:13.479
Yeah, it depends on what kind of visitor you a re exactly. So we could say some kind of

424
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.000
low key visitor

425
00:19:18.219 --> 00:19:19.579
even this 50%.

426
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.319
I mean, they're all separate or

427
00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:23.089
actually

428
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.689
Gisela 50% means that she's there

429
00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.449
half time. Uh, generally in the mornings,

430
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.880
Gisela has a fixed schedule for when she's there. But David and Martin a re sort of,

431
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.500
they f it fluctuates like they can't say that they'll be there Monday,

432
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.280
Tuesday and half of Wednesday

433
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.160
and not the rest of the time,

434
00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:42.359
which is part of the problem. I mean,

435
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.890
they can't

436
00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.569
specify when exactly they'll be there.

437
00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:51.579
So, our rationale for putting them in a three person rooms

438
00:19:51.729 --> 00:19:53.089
is that it doesn't matter

439
00:19:53.479 --> 00:19:57.050
when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not,

440
00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.290
it's just either there's two or three people

441
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.949
in those rooms and sometimes there's less,

442
00:20:00.959 --> 00:20:02.000
sometimes there's more

443
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.959
because we also don't work fixed hours.

444
00:20:04.969 --> 00:20:08.479
It's not like we work, you know, 9 to 5 or whatever, everyone sort of

445
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.489
keeps their own hours.

446
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.209
So, can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals?

447
00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:16.250
The key differences?

448
00:20:17.709 --> 00:20:17.719
I

449
00:20:18.439 --> 00:20:20.400
think it's what I tried to, to do before shared

450
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:21.650
lounge, the shared

451
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.770
-- lounge, the
-- assistance with their professors,

452
00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:25.939
two

453
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:26.800
cases.

454
00:20:27.439 --> 00:20:27.469
And

455
00:20:27.609 --> 00:20:27.739
then

456
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.349
do you have

457
00:20:28.689 --> 00:20:28.699
a

458
00:20:29.089 --> 00:20:29.160
separate?

459
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:30.540
We have P

460
00:20:31.339 --> 00:20:32.589
and Marianne in.

461
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.780
No, I think this is quite accepted in this

462
00:20:34.969 --> 00:20:35.050
case.

463
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.020
No, I think it's uh the lounge, uh

464
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.510
the admin room,

465
00:20:39.969 --> 00:20:40.459
the lo the

466
00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.130
-- admin room
-- separate. Yeah, and the number of slots for visitor

467
00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:50.189
and for this new student who arrives because having just one spare place,

468
00:20:50.199 --> 00:20:53.000
this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group.

469
00:20:53.199 --> 00:20:54.130
People said uh

470
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.890
we should have a t least two or three spare places

471
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:02.829
just for, you know, growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive.

472
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.300
So even if they a re not perfect places.

473
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.599
Um

474
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.780
ok. So you basically

475
00:21:11.449 --> 00:21:15.310
-- achieve that by giving less space to the reading
-- room, I think.

476
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.959
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's how I did inin our proposal. Yeah,

477
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.010
I guess one of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group?

478
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.589
Really? Is it, is it something that's a very

479
00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:31.160
valued thing that has to be protected,

480
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:32.579
um,

481
00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.910
or is it okay to make it be kind of this spare

482
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.609
space that gets used up a little bit when you need,

483
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.099
when you have some extra visitors and things like that. I think that's,

484
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.689
I think because it's a fairly new thing, it's

485
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.339
a little hard to say a t this point.

486
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:51.780
I think that most people like it now that it's there,

487
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.780
they sort of see the value of it and

488
00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:57.420
they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely. Definitely.

489
00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:00.650
But I suppose once it, if it gets eaten away a little bit,

490
00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.439
a tot some point it becomes unuseful.

491
00:22:02.449 --> 00:22:03.410
And then, yeah,

492
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:05.510
and that's the danger.

493
00:22:07.209 --> 00:22:11.550
But then we need to squeeze inin one of the three person rooms,

494
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.060
some extra visitor space.

495
00:22:14.069 --> 00:22:14.709
And, uh,

496
00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:17.750
I, I think so if, if we want to keep the reading room,

497
00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:21.280
I, I think it's possible like playing a little bit with the furniture.

498
00:22:22.699 --> 00:22:23.510
Um,

499
00:22:24.369 --> 00:22:25.109
so,

500
00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:30.180
yeah, I think another point here and I don't know how you, you feel about it is, well,

501
00:22:30.189 --> 00:22:34.469
the fact that Martin is said he would be quite noisy, 50% of the time,

502
00:22:34.479 --> 00:22:35.839
so many phone calls.

503
00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:39.310
So I wouldn't put him in that big office even if he's 50%.

504
00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:41.719
But he's still a professor here and

505
00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.069
we got him from EPFL.

506
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:45.949
So that

507
00:22:46.569 --> 00:22:50.030
I, I think, I mean, if we need to reach a solution. Now,

508
00:22:50.439 --> 00:22:50.449
I,

509
00:22:50.459 --> 00:22:53.760
I wouldn't mind working from your plan and doing some

510
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.650
changes or if you prefer working from mine and doing

511
00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:56.949
other

512
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:57.550
changes.

513
00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:58.699
Um,

514
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.689
so, um,

515
00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:04.030
-- okay, well, since this one's up, keep
-- this one in. Okay. Yeah.

516
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.469
Depends how, how easy you can write in it easily.

517
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.329
Okay. So let's keep the reading room.

518
00:23:10.599 --> 00:23:11.729
Uh, also I think P

519
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.040
Janet and Martin should deserve a t least,

520
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.030
I think offices with one person, not with two.

521
00:23:18.369 --> 00:23:18.619
Okay.

522
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.439
Maybe. Can we combine both or like

523
00:23:21.939 --> 00:23:23.050
two person room

524
00:23:23.209 --> 00:23:23.640
PP and Martin.

525
00:23:24.959 --> 00:23:26.589
Yeah, Martin is 50%.

526
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.000
We, we never ask them. It could be. But um

527
00:23:30.209 --> 00:23:34.560
because the other side they have, I think no real project in common. So

528
00:23:34.869 --> 00:23:35.739
I wonder

529
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:37.180
what

530
00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:37.540
uh

531
00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:41.099
I think I would prefer and probably my group

532
00:23:41.109 --> 00:23:43.790
would prefer to see them with the respective assistance.

533
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.250
And I think Pierrette

534
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.979
plus Marianne

535
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.579
is a very good combination.

536
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:48.520
Why not

537
00:23:49.449 --> 00:23:52.189
switching them from? Yeah, that office.

538
00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:54.479
Yeah. Switch the whole group.

539
00:23:55.109 --> 00:23:55.800
Yeah, Marianne

540
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.150
Swedish. And then,

541
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.339
so what does that mean? Swedish?

542
00:24:01.449 --> 00:24:02.010
-- Um
-- There's

543
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:02.239
two V

544
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:05.040
one is Swedish, one is Finnish. So we just call them

545
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.800
the Swedish and the Finnish.

546
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.739
Both Fami

547
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.359
na Mes start with ST A

548
00:24:13.819 --> 00:24:14.630
no, both start with

549
00:24:14.739 --> 00:24:14.790
s

550
00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:16.660
so just to

551
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.250
-- know who they a
-- re okay.

552
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.170
Uh It was Bruno,

553
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:24.849
right?

554
00:24:27.209 --> 00:24:27.839
Ok.

555
00:24:28.209 --> 00:24:29.099
Mhm.

556
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.569
Now, let's do something with Martin too.

557
00:24:32.979 --> 00:24:33.750
Um,

558
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.079
-- but
-- even you can create one more speed

559
00:24:36.189 --> 00:24:38.180
place in the big three piece room

560
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.709
in here.

561
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.500
Yeah, maybe we can write it.

562
00:24:41.609 --> 00:24:41.959
This

563
00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:46.680
one. David is 50% and visitor one sh, yeah, or spare. Or

564
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.660
it's fine.

565
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:48.969
Mm.

566
00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.589
-- Well, for
-- Martin, if you didn't mind working with Martin,

567
00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:53.800
we can switch Nancy and Martin

568
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.239
here.

569
00:24:54.959 --> 00:24:55.880
I think that's

570
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.199
closer to what

571
00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.229
they said.

572
00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:58.459
Oops.

573
00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:04.020
Well, because actually we have this project in common,

574
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.939
you know, go lime too.

575
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:07.599
Oh,

576
00:25:08.359 --> 00:25:09.119
wrong keyboard.

577
00:25:10.469 --> 00:25:11.300
I heard of that.

578
00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.979
Um Yeah, I think it's, and so could we,

579
00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:22.630
-- um, so
-- we can say that this is sort of for,

580
00:25:22.829 --> 00:25:25.150
but then again, you get the more formal visitor

581
00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:26.550
in with

582
00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:28.910
a bunch of students in a crowded room.

583
00:25:29.979 --> 00:25:30.989
Well, I think,

584
00:25:31.209 --> 00:25:32.050
yeah. Or Gisela.

585
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.239
But I think there is no way to,

586
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.260
-- well, you can say
-- that this one is for, let's say stas

587
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:37.310
or

588
00:25:37.739 --> 00:25:38.239
intern,

589
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.910
yeah, sort of second. Uh

590
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.199
-- um um
-- Yeah,

591
00:25:42.449 --> 00:25:46.170
but you, you can move administration to the single room like

592
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.079
because she's only 50% working and,

593
00:25:50.329 --> 00:25:51.189
and she will,

594
00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:54.130
so you would put

595
00:25:54.739 --> 00:25:58.520
-- in a one person room
-- and give that room to some professor

596
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.520
with the student or from professor with the visiting place or?

597
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:02.869
Mhm.

598
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.829
Yeah, we could,

599
00:26:07.099 --> 00:26:08.280
yeah, even put,

600
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.869
we can move Maggie and Bruno.

601
00:26:12.099 --> 00:26:14.119
We couldn't put Maggie and Bruno together,

602
00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:14.900
Gisela

603
00:26:15.569 --> 00:26:17.099
and move the other spare place

604
00:26:17.569 --> 00:26:19.400
to the big room. But then there's not

605
00:26:19.699 --> 00:26:20.949
a lot of people in there.

606
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.380
No, let's leave it like this for the moment.

607
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.589
How do you feel because your office, well,

608
00:26:27.599 --> 00:26:30.140
three persons and you're all full time in there.

609
00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:34.189
-- So, you, with Nancy and Maria, we're
-- not terribly noisy. I think it'll be fine.

610
00:26:34.989 --> 00:26:35.890
Yeah. And you have per

611
00:26:36.449 --> 00:26:37.910
does in common with Nancy

612
00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.859
and I am too, in common with Maria and

613
00:26:41.089 --> 00:26:43.060
we work on slightly different schedules too because

614
00:26:43.069 --> 00:26:44.859
Maria and I tend to work earlier and

615
00:26:45.339 --> 00:26:46.770
Nancy tends to work later.

616
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.260
So that shouldn't be a problem.

617
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.890
And do you think we could put a visitor with Nikos

618
00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:53.329
and

619
00:26:53.709 --> 00:26:54.050
Yalina?

620
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.130
Because it's, it's also, it's not very clear, you know,

621
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.369
Yalina s that was said in our meeting,

622
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.290
Yalina sm

623
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.189
master thesis should be defended,

624
00:27:03.339 --> 00:27:05.770
you know, couple of months or something like that.

625
00:27:06.189 --> 00:27:08.619
So we don't really know what happens afterwards.

626
00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:12.040
So we could a t least think it's sort of an open place

627
00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:15.819
or you could get that office for you and Nancy and put Nikos

628
00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:16.829
and, uh,

629
00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:18.680
Yalina with Maria

630
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.060
and a visitor.

631
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.829
What about that?

632
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.150
When would you like to have a columnar spot?

633
00:27:26.819 --> 00:27:27.060
Um,

634
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.709
so you want to do?

635
00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:31.520
That's gonna backfire me.

636
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:35.209
So, when you, when you put four people in that office,

637
00:27:35.219 --> 00:27:37.199
does that mean you're planning on four desks?

638
00:27:37.209 --> 00:27:38.729
You need space for four desks

639
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:39.180
and

640
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.800
that's the problem

641
00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:41.300
if it's

642
00:27:41.489 --> 00:27:41.890
possible.

643
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.449
Yeah, you either get smaller desks because the ones that we have now won't fit.

644
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.630
Yeah. But a visitor actually, um, doesn't have that much paper.

645
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.670
So, for instance, maybe they don't need, uh,

646
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.170
well, uh, the place to put their files, you know, a small, uh, drawer,

647
00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.390
they just need a, a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath.

648
00:28:01.729 --> 00:28:02.829
And so you can fit that,

649
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.109
but you can't put three desks in the two person rooms.

650
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:09.939
Yeah, probably not. I think it wouldn't be, uh,

651
00:28:10.719 --> 00:28:13.819
Yelena. And we, we could think of a visitor too here.

652
00:28:15.079 --> 00:28:16.699
So I think it's gonna be too much.

653
00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:17.729
And so

654
00:28:20.319 --> 00:28:21.310
there is also this Paola

655
00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:22.420
arriving

656
00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:25.420
um on the new project. So,

657
00:28:25.699 --> 00:28:27.660
you know, Susan insisted that uh

658
00:28:28.979 --> 00:28:29.839
we should be

659
00:28:32.989 --> 00:28:35.369
and it's all, it's also, it's not very clear

660
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.459
because Nikos

661
00:28:36.579 --> 00:28:36.890
and

662
00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:38.260
Yalina a re well, Nikos

663
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.250
is um

664
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.829
research student,

665
00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:43.530
Yalina will finish her master thesis. So it's

666
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.000
Yeah. OK.

667
00:28:46.209 --> 00:28:46.520
Yeah,

668
00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:47.020
Paola

669
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:47.469
or

670
00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:47.869
like that

671
00:28:49.479 --> 00:28:50.099
or maybe B LA

672
00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:51.619
will be able to choose.

673
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.819
Yeah, I think that's quite okay.

674
00:28:53.829 --> 00:28:58.089
Uh Do you know about any preference of Maggie being alone or with Bruno?

675
00:28:58.469 --> 00:28:59.660
I don't think she cares.

676
00:29:00.099 --> 00:29:00.449
Yeah.

677
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.040
Um David mentioned also that

678
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.609
there should be some kind of gender balance.

679
00:29:08.319 --> 00:29:11.739
I, I don't know if there is a strong constraint but I think we're doing pretty well.

680
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:12.180
You mean?

681
00:29:12.989 --> 00:29:16.040
-- So
-- maybe you should break the wall between the men's room and the women's

682
00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:21.390
not

683
00:29:21.609 --> 00:29:21.849
sure that

684
00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:22.339
what

685
00:29:22.439 --> 00:29:22.550
was

686
00:29:24.109 --> 00:29:26.709
actually Bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a

687
00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:30.140
lot of people because he did that before and he didn't really like it.

688
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.410
So maybe,

689
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.280
I don't know. I can switch with him and we can put him and Nancy together. I don't mind.

690
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.430
It doesn't really bother me.

691
00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.989
Ok. That's fine if you mentioned this to

692
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:41.209
you.

693
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:42.319
Quite

694
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:42.790
nice.

695
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.760
And, ok. Yeah, I'm with Martin.

696
00:29:45.969 --> 00:29:47.160
That's very balanced.

697
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.400
Well, the gender balancing, we have more women than men in our department anyways.

698
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:53.810
So,

699
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.030
yeah, that's why.

700
00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.689
Okay if you don't mind me sharing the office with Martin, that's fine.

701
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.770
Okay. Yeah, that looks good. So,

702
00:30:01.479 --> 00:30:01.750
with,

703
00:30:02.329 --> 00:30:04.849
and David. Yeah. So you have IM two in common.

704
00:30:05.339 --> 00:30:09.329
That's nice. And here's 50%. So that means the office is not very crowded.

705
00:30:09.939 --> 00:30:12.609
Okay. The other one is a bit crowded but that's okay.

706
00:30:12.619 --> 00:30:15.489
Do you see any constraints from the administrative side?

707
00:30:18.609 --> 00:30:21.229
But even like you can put polar in

708
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:22.910
administrative,

709
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.689
you already three people.

710
00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:26.439
It

711
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.060
looks like small room compared to the other three

712
00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.260
is your person to square meter ratio within the university norms.

713
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.140
Um, I, I

714
00:30:38.319 --> 00:30:38.390
think

715
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.489
we don't, we don't, I mean,

716
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.500
we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and,

717
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.170
and, and everyone having their own office.

718
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.469
If that's not what we're having in the other places,

719
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.839
we have to make sure that um,

720
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:56.390
if for exa Mples, there's a spare reading room, like we were saying before,

721
00:30:56.979 --> 00:31:01.119
overall, your department has, doesn't have excessive space per person.

722
00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:06.500
Well, what was said, Inin, my group actually, Susan,

723
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:10.380
who knows professors from other, um, other faculties.

724
00:31:10.599 --> 00:31:13.760
Well, she noticed that most of them have rooms alone.

725
00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:18.219
So this is true for Susan and Maggie, but not true here for

726
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.750
Pierrette and, and Martin.

727
00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.660
So we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the, the professors.

728
00:31:25.099 --> 00:31:28.810
It's true that the reading room, but, you know, we fought so much to have it.

729
00:31:28.819 --> 00:31:30.750
So let's, uh let's try to have it there.

730
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.900
And I think putting four people in a three person room

731
00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.949
is already a sign that uh we a re already quite uh

732
00:31:38.219 --> 00:31:39.650
quite full. So, um

733
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.500
I think, yeah, it's normally the nominal capacity of this. I think it's uh

734
00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.949
18 people,

735
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.469
um 18 or, or 17

736
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.680
and we're already 15 if you don't count

737
00:31:52.869 --> 00:31:55.459
Paola and some visitor's place.

738
00:31:55.939 --> 00:31:59.880
And I think it's quite important to have space for visitors because

739
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:03.050
if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new,

740
00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:06.459
well, intern during the summer, you're re very much handicapped.

741
00:32:07.349 --> 00:32:08.630
So I think we're, yeah.

742
00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.670
Um Well, the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already. So I,

743
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.010
-- we tried
-- to

744
00:32:15.329 --> 00:32:17.089
basically, we're moving into a new space, but it's

745
00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:20.520
only marginally better than the old one.

746
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.430
Yeah.

747
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.709
So I think, yeah, what we could say about the reading room is that we,

748
00:32:25.719 --> 00:32:28.449
we squeeze quite a lot of people inin the other offices.

749
00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:28.699
So

750
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:29.859
I think it's okay.

751
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:32.130
No,

752
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.050
it's good in case I ever have to defend it.

753
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.969
You know, it's good to have some numbers, if you can come up with some numbers.

754
00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.369
Yeah, we can do that

755
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.790
and maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments. That's,

756
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.290
it's good to have that.

757
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.459
But if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy,

758
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:53.939
then um

759
00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.689
it's fine with me. I don't know about you. What do you think?

760
00:32:58.069 --> 00:32:58.150
So?

761
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.479
Maybe it's another name,

762
00:33:06.229 --> 00:33:07.569
just say, OK, it's fine.

763
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.359
Okay. Okay.

764
00:33:14.849 --> 00:33:17.500
So my group also asked to circulate

765
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.180
the final proposal just to

766
00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:24.400
everyone along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space.

767
00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:26.300
Ok?

768
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:26.949
-- We're
-- done.

769
00:33:27.449 --> 00:33:27.719
Great.

770
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:28.949
-- Thank you for your
-- time. Thank

771
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:29.219
you.

772
00:33:29.729 --> 00:33:30.229
Thank you,

773
00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:31.000
sir.

774
00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.010
Ok?

775
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:36.349
And the hookers downstairs.
