00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:24.239
Welcome everyone. I'm Shree

1
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.430
and Ken.

2
00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.590
I'm a research

3
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.870
assistant professor at the Bio

4
00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:27.920
Complexity Institute.

5
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.760
I'm really excited to be the moderator for the session.

6
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.290
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has appended lives across the world.

7
00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.970
It has also integrated the global scientific

8
00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.290
community to join forces and make significant strides

9
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.139
in fundamental research, technology development

10
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.290
and real time

11
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.060
support.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.409
As we embark on this third year of this pandemic,

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
it is a useful time to reflect upon the road travel so far

14
00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:56.130
and what it means for the future of pandemic science and preparedness

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.459
to discuss this topic with us.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.369
We have three eminent experts in

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.040
scientific operational and technological aspects.

18
00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:04.680
Doctor Eli Klein

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.680
Justin Crow

20
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.430
and Doctor Li Jian.

21
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.110
Welcome everyone to the panel.

22
00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:14.900
Just before we get started. I'll give a brief idea of the panel format.

23
00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:17.940
We'll begin with initial remarks from each of the panelists.

24
00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:22.980
Following that, we'll have a specific set of questions on the panic response so far,

25
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.730
the second part will focus on the path forward and what's next for epidemiology.

26
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.839
We'll also have time for audience questions at the end of each part.

27
00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:35.010
So further ado I'll invite our first Panelist to give their initial remarks.

28
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.430
Doctor Elly Klein is an Associate professor,

29
00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:40.650
the Department of Emergency Medicine at

30
00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.370
Johns Hopkins University.

31
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.239
Upon finishing his phd in Ecology

32
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.160
and evolutionary Biology from Princeton University.

33
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.910
Doctor Klein joined the Johns Hopkins faculty in 2012.

34
00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:54.639
He is also a senior fellow at the Center

35
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.309
for Disease Dynamics Economics and Policy in Washington DC.

36
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.830
His research focuses on the role of

37
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:03.510
individuals in the spread of infectious diseases,

38
00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.889
an area that sits at the nexus of economics and epidemiology.

39
00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:10.169
The primary disease focus of Doctor Klein's research

40
00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.059
is antimicrobial resistance

41
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.080
and the spread of disease within the hospital.

42
00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.559
He's actively involved in research efforts supported

43
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.619
by the Centers for disease control and prevention

44
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.839
as well as Agency for healthcare research and quality.

45
00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:24.270
Welcome, Doctor Klein

46
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.460
on to you for your initial remarks.

47
00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.610
Thank you so much, everyone for being here and uh very exciting to be at this event.

48
00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:36.220
Well, sort of be at this event. Sorry, I can't actually be there in person,

49
00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:41.050
but I think it's very timely at at least somewhat as we move

50
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.320
into the starting to move into this post pandemic phase

51
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.000
to sort of begin the process of looking back.

52
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.880
I mean, I think this is an exciting

53
00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:50.080
time period, uh

54
00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:52.410
start evaluating how things are doing,

55
00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.869
especially as it looks like another pandemic is starting

56
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.740
and

57
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.770
as we all start to gear up to look at monkeypox.

58
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.429
But you know, I I think given sort of the historical background.

59
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.110
There's a lot of things that we've learned over the last couple of years.

60
00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:10.710
I know there's a lot of questions that

61
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.250
we're gonna be talking about within that context.

62
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:14.160
But,

63
00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.639
you know, my research has been on mathematical modeling and,

64
00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:21.039
and antimicrobial resistance and infectious disease the last couple of years

65
00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.690
prior to COVID. And

66
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.889
the transition to COVID meant

67
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.630
for all of us devising new models or repurposing

68
00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.399
old models and trying to understand the context of

69
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.059
how all of these things fit together and what

70
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.880
was the most appropriate for public policy and,

71
00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.000
and for the audiences that we were trying to address.

72
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.910
And, and I think

73
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.990
the resulting impact of all of this is,

74
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.289
is what we've seen is that there's been a tremendous amount of effort now to both

75
00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:52.570
improve how the models work and the ability of those models to provide some utility,

76
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.889
but also to drive important connections across the system.

77
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.130
And whether that is grants that are

78
00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.490
specifically related to trying to improve ties between

79
00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:07.589
the academic researchers and, and public health departments

80
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.330
or whether it's sort of broader national goals of,

81
00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.570
of building these networks of forecasting

82
00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.890
all the forecasting models or the scenario modeling hubs,

83
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.010
all of these things to bridge these

84
00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:24.412
groups together and try to find ways in which to

85
00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:28.382
communicate the policies and communicate the science in a way

86
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.613
that can provide some input in the public policy.

87
00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:35.972
And I think as we've seen over the last several years is politicians have chosen

88
00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:39.032
when it's convenient to follow and listen to the

89
00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:41.472
models and when it has not been convenient,

90
00:04:41.483 --> 00:04:43.173
they may have not followed them.

91
00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:44.852
And it's unfortunate in some

92
00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:46.656
to see the science politicized.

93
00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:48.496
But I think partly

94
00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.846
where we can sort of go with this and thinking about these things,

95
00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:55.716
how to take these meetings and events and formalize them

96
00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:58.115
in a way that can make it more of a

97
00:04:58.276 --> 00:05:02.496
standard in terms of how these things are communicated. So that

98
00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.026
when people look at

99
00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:08.656
information, it's not novel, it's not new in the same way that it has been

100
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.269
and,

101
00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.549
and the way that we've been asked in many ways to think

102
00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.190
about it is to think about it in the terms and the way

103
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.450
weather forecasting has worked, right?

104
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.470
And I think there's a lot of misleading aspects to that parallel.

105
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.109
And most importantly being that

106
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.149
uh when you make a weather forecast,

107
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.609
that doesn't change the weather forecast,

108
00:05:28.769 --> 00:05:31.140
whereas if you make a disease prediction,

109
00:05:31.299 --> 00:05:33.829
that could actually change how that prediction plays out,

110
00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:38.290
obviously, that that's a major issue in terms of thinking about it. But

111
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.230
when we think about the history of weather forecasting over the last 50 or 70 years,

112
00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:48.559
it has been a tremendously large investment over the span

113
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.910
of seven years to the point where we are now,

114
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:56.200
you know, the first stuff involved radar balloons and now we have satellites,

115
00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.450
right?

116
00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:58.040
And then the launch of a satellite costs

117
00:05:58.049 --> 00:06:02.040
something like $60 million for each satellite.

118
00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:04.600
And there's several weather satellites and they launch

119
00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:06.739
a new one every couple of years

120
00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:08.480
and they're touting the fact that we put

121
00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:11.380
25 million into potentially forecasting in one year.

122
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.459
So, I mean,

123
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.929
I think that there's a lot of infrastructure that still needs

124
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.920
to be built and there's a lot of sort of basic work

125
00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.480
that goes into building weather forecasts that we

126
00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:22.940
don't sort of have that built in infrastructure,

127
00:06:23.179 --> 00:06:23.859
not that I,

128
00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:28.160
I think we should get to the same level and there are different policy outcomes,

129
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.160
the weather forecasting.

130
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.540
I think

131
00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.089
in terms of how people thought about it, that's what they've thought about.

132
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.230
And so from that end,

133
00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:38.179
I think we need a lot more money to sort of formalize a lot of things, these things.

134
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.839
On the other hand,

135
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.959
I think we also need to start reframing how

136
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.720
modeling can be useful in informing public policy.

137
00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:49.239
And I think that's sort of the like broader context in which I I I'll

138
00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:51.170
try to stay within my time frame.

139
00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:55.649
That's really helpful and it sets the context for the discussion because

140
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.600
we're right at this nexus point where we can look backwards,

141
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.220
but we still have some memory that we can carry forward

142
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.440
so that we don't re invent the wheel every time.

143
00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:05.239
So without

144
00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.619
going further, I'll go ahead to the next Panelist for their initial remarks

145
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:13.519
Justin Crow, I I mean, I got to know him remotely like uh two years back

146
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.540
and only last week we met in person for the first time.

147
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.000
So Justin K is the Director of Division of Social Epidemiology

148
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.959
Office of Health Equity at the Virginia Department of Health,

149
00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:28.140
where his role is to provide strategic and operational leadership of research,

150
00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:29.480
analysis and presentation

151
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.329
to ensure methodological and data quality

152
00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:34.970
and to collaborate with stakeholders to identify needs.

153
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:35.859
Recently,

154
00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:39.609
he started in his new role as foresight and analytics coordinator

155
00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:43.040
at the Virginia Department of Health Office of Emergency Preparedness.

156
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.619
His task there involves better connection of forecasting

157
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.019
early warning systems and modeling to policy decisions, program design

158
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.720
and preparedness planning.

159
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.549
He has a master's in public

160
00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:57.690
administration from the Virginia Commonwealth University

161
00:07:57.869 --> 00:08:01.380
and a BLS in Political Science from University of Mary Washington.

162
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:05.380
He is also a certified super forecaster with the good Judgment project

163
00:08:05.679 --> 00:08:06.750
where he provides pro

164
00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:11.480
forecasts of political and economic events for diverse group of plants.

165
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.720
Welcome Justin and on to you.

166
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.720
Great. Thank you Srini.

167
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:18.700
And yeah, it's been great working with you and your team at the Bio

168
00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:21.269
Complexity Institute for the past two years.

169
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.750
It's been a trying time, but I've learned a lot working with you all.

170
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.760
Yeah, Srini mentioned my background here.

171
00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:33.070
I'm not an academic, I don't have really much training in epidemiology or you know,

172
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.130
statistical methods or modeling here.

173
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.940
Uh My background is in public administration.

174
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.830
Uh I did study policy analysis but I got my start

175
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:46.039
really in regulatory analysis, looking at regulation of health professionals.

176
00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:48.739
And I ended up in in health and social epidemiology

177
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.840
really due to my background and understanding of uh social,

178
00:08:51.849 --> 00:08:56.669
demographic and economic data sets and also the health workforce realm.

179
00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:58.799
So

180
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.119
I do have, you know, during my studies, I did take some modeling, some data,

181
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.979
some analysis, really geographic information systems classes.

182
00:09:06.989 --> 00:09:10.270
But while I was working as a regulatory alys, as

183
00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.530
you mentioned, I did get involved with the Good Judgment project, which is an

184
00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.130
aggregate human forecasting tournament.

185
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.869
They forecast geopolitical events and you know, our role was just to go in and,

186
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.770
and kind of analyze those events.

187
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:26.369
I think about it pretty thoroughly and try to understand what was going on with

188
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:31.150
those events and give a a probability that an event would occur or not occur

189
00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:34.330
or you know, different outcomes that they would look at. So

190
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.710
again, not really formal training, that was a hobby,

191
00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.200
but I did get some training and some experiences

192
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.919
thinking about the future and how forecasting would work.

193
00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:44.330
And that was enough of a background as

194
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.880
Renee mentioned for me to

195
00:09:46.119 --> 00:09:48.979
when the pandemic hit to be assigned to coordinate the

196
00:09:48.989 --> 00:09:52.599
the forecasting and modeling work that really U VA was doing

197
00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.880
and they hit the ground running.

198
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.520
I don't know if you all remember,

199
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.349
I'm sure you do at the beginning of the pandemic when uh

200
00:10:00.489 --> 00:10:02.780
it was first affecting uh Wuhan China.

201
00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:08.049
They were throwing up huge hospitals in 10 days to treat so many patients. Of course,

202
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.840
uh Italy's health system was getting overwhelmed,

203
00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:13.474
were doing emergency triage at the time,

204
00:10:13.594 --> 00:10:13.965
right?

205
00:10:13.974 --> 00:10:16.094
When cases were beginning to explode in New York

206
00:10:16.104 --> 00:10:18.005
and uh we were sending the US s comfort

207
00:10:18.015 --> 00:10:19.614
up there and starting to throw up our own

208
00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:22.445
field hospitals around the country here in Virginia.

209
00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.315
Though we were able to, we started to throw up this, you know,

210
00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:26.625
put up those field hospitals.

211
00:10:26.635 --> 00:10:27.965
But we were able to pause that

212
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.659
largely because the U VA Bio

213
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.690
Complexity Institute and their models were showing that the measures being taken,

214
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.020
the public health emergency

215
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.369
uh measures were were being effective and they

216
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.510
were flattening the curve here in Virginia.

217
00:10:41.789 --> 00:10:43.830
So we were able to pause those field hospitals,

218
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.830
save ourselves or save really in the end FAA

219
00:10:47.119 --> 00:10:48.429
great deal of money.

220
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.109
But for us, a staff of V DH uh save staff time and resources at a very,

221
00:10:53.289 --> 00:10:55.630
very trying and stressful time.

222
00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.109
So that work was essential to get us really started with uh what's been overall,

223
00:11:00.119 --> 00:11:03.090
a pretty successful response to the pandemic.

224
00:11:03.489 --> 00:11:05.049
Virginia is

225
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.900
number 10 in age adjusted death for COVID throughout the pandemic.

226
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.450
And uh prior to the pandemic, we were we ranked 17th in that rank.

227
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.419
So for response to COVID, I think that says a lot,

228
00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:19.419
one of the things I like about forecasting

229
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.909
and working with the modeling team here is that

230
00:11:22.109 --> 00:11:24.469
you do really need to know everything that you

231
00:11:24.479 --> 00:11:27.429
can about any situation or protect the future.

232
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.520
So whether you're doing quantitative modeling and, and you have uh a novel convert

233
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:31.989
virus,

234
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.880
you need to know as much as you can about

235
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.200
that virus and what's going on and how people are

236
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.369
reacting to try to understand what's going on in the

237
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.830
future and develop a different scenarios for your model.

238
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.260
Uh The same is true for, for

239
00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:43.429
a

240
00:11:43.539 --> 00:11:45.869
human forecast, you're putting a probability on say,

241
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.340
you know whether a mass mandate will be put in place or lifted,

242
00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:51.900
you need to know everything you can about the number of cases,

243
00:11:51.909 --> 00:11:53.260
the policies and the political.

244
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.710
So

245
00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:57.979
you're bringing in a lot of different data and information systems. So

246
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.380
with the U VA team, of course, they had a voracious appetite for data and we were,

247
00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:07.239
we were very eager to supply at the beginning, but we really immediately saw issues.

248
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.099
Uh right at the beginning of the pandemic,

249
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.380
the public health emergency helped us.

250
00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.390
It helped us kind of vent some of our, our rules. But

251
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.159
uh we had difficulty getting really data sharing agreements in place.

252
00:12:18.169 --> 00:12:22.809
We had difficulties with data integration, uh interoperability of the data,

253
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.460
bringing it all together and getting really the U VA team and users uh up to speed on

254
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.650
what data was available, what the limitations were and how it was collected.

255
00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:34.770
Uh So that they could really understand how to use it.

256
00:12:35.619 --> 00:12:40.260
So I'm excited to uh at this point, you know, look back at lessons learned,

257
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.369
we talked about

258
00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:46.479
the need to do a postmortem for the modeling specifically, really understanding

259
00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:51.380
how to get those systems in place and, and keep them in place for the next pandemic.

260
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.000
Should it come?

261
00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.640
Hopefully, uh it's not monkey pots, but we're still keeping a very close eye on that

262
00:12:57.909 --> 00:13:01.950
and to really understand how we can link modeling,

263
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.460
forecasting these data streams to decisions.

264
00:13:04.619 --> 00:13:07.140
As I said, it's not always as well linked as we'd like.

265
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.590
Sometimes we put those forecasting projections out there and

266
00:13:09.599 --> 00:13:11.320
people aren't quite sure what to do with them,

267
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.419
particularly when there are scenarios

268
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.830
and using it for policy analysis.

269
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.530
So one of the things I hope to do in my new position and I'm

270
00:13:18.539 --> 00:13:23.590
I'm glad that Virginia has made a commitment to that role and that work is to

271
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.890
data streams and these projections to policy decisions.

272
00:13:28.289 --> 00:13:29.520
Thank you, Justin. And

273
00:13:29.729 --> 00:13:32.179
I see mother and Brian are there in the main room.

274
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.929
I I think they can attest to the fact that

275
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.340
you've been a champion in terms of taking our models and

276
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.729
taking it to the right divisions,

277
00:13:38.739 --> 00:13:41.510
but also going to the divisions and getting their problems and bringing it back

278
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.890
to us and navigating the data landscape has been challenging right from day one,

279
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.729
even till date,

280
00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:50.929
like trying to figure out whether this data works with that on the modeling front,

281
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.760
but also whether the same license agreement works,

282
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.190
do you need to reach out to a different person? And I think

283
00:13:56.429 --> 00:13:58.210
that's been a big challenge and I think that's

284
00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:00.500
something that we'll talk about in the next part.

285
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.880
So on the next analyst, Dr

286
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.489
Li

287
00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:07.390
Xiang is a professor of Computer Science and biomedical informatics

288
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:08.989
at Emory University.

289
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.369
She held a Winship, distinguished

290
00:14:11.659 --> 00:14:14.010
professorship from 2015 to 2018.

291
00:14:14.469 --> 00:14:17.340
She has a phd from Georgia Institute of Technology

292
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:19.580
and MS from Johns Hopkins University

293
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.570
and a BS from University of Science and Technology of China.

294
00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:27.080
She and a research lab conduct research on algorithms and methods

295
00:14:27.349 --> 00:14:30.090
at the intersection of data management, machine learning

296
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.200
and data privacy and security

297
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.729
with a recent focus on privacy, preserving and reverse machine learning.

298
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.789
Her research is supported by federal agencies including Nsfnihaf, OS R

299
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:46.669
Porry and Industry Awards including Google IBM Cisco to name a few.

300
00:14:47.349 --> 00:14:50.250
She is an I AAA fellow and an AC M distinguished member.

301
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.750
Welcome, Doctor Li Jian

302
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.130
on to you.

303
00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.460
So thank you. She

304
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.049
thank you everyone for inviting me. It's a great pleasure for me to be here.

305
00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.320
I had the pleasure and fortune to work with Mado

306
00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.750
and the entire team for the virtual organization, prepare

307
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.679
for computing. Researchers work on pandemic research that's sponsored by NSF.

308
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.710
So I learned a lot from the team

309
00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:14.229
in general. So my lab,

310
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.289
we are not a epidemiology or as

311
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:17.549
she

312
00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:18.119
mentioned,

313
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:21.669
my background is mainly computer science and in particular on data privacy

314
00:15:22.239 --> 00:15:23.789
and robust machine learning.

315
00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:27.950
So my lab is basically working on intersection of data management,

316
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.030
machine learning and information security

317
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.030
and we work on particularly for

318
00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:34.570
health applications and location based applications

319
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.770
and of course public health applications.

320
00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:41.020
So this pandemic research really is a great opportunity for us to use.

321
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.340
For example, like mobility data, utilize our expertise in these areas,

322
00:15:45.349 --> 00:15:48.580
try to come up with solutions to help on public health research.

323
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:54.219
So we have had the opportunity to work on two projects related to pandemic research.

324
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.059
The first one is a project funded by the NSF Rapid Program

325
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.679
where we try to develop a real time contact tracing and risk monitoring system

326
00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:06.659
via privacy enhanced mobile tracking. So this project ended recently

327
00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:07.849
and

328
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.599
the goal uh as we can see here now is this is really a very familiar concept.

329
00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:16.400
We wanted to have users submit their locations so that we

330
00:16:16.409 --> 00:16:19.489
can use the locations to figure out to do contact tracing,

331
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.679
to try to based on where the users visit and who the users have contact with.

332
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.440
Then we can figure out the risk of each individual users.

333
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.080
And one of the main component of our project is to

334
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.479
enhance the privacy because the raw locations can be privacy sensitive.

335
00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:37.890
And

336
00:16:38.109 --> 00:16:39.789
in order to enhance privacy,

337
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.650
our main research is to see how users can actually control and uh refine

338
00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:49.659
the precision of the location in order to share the location to the server,

339
00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:51.270
so that the server can use the location to

340
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.070
do the contact tracing and the risk monitoring.

341
00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:56.369
And we are using a statistical privacy notion.

342
00:16:56.469 --> 00:16:58.179
And some of you might be familiar with,

343
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.190
it's called geo indistinguishable,

344
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.119
which is really a generalized variant of the differential privacy,

345
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.060
which is more commonly known.

346
00:17:05.229 --> 00:17:07.079
This is a generalization of the differential

347
00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.300
privacy notion in the geospatial domain.

348
00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.300
And essentially you can think of it as just a perturbation mechanism.

349
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.839
If the user have a true location,

350
00:17:14.848 --> 00:17:19.449
we can actually perturb the location on the device using some privacy parameter.

351
00:17:19.948 --> 00:17:21.928
And you can see on the left hand side,

352
00:17:21.938 --> 00:17:24.529
these are based on different privacy parameters.

353
00:17:24.898 --> 00:17:26.198
If you have the true location,

354
00:17:26.208 --> 00:17:31.848
the blue dot then you can actually draw a random sample from the distribution

355
00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:35.548
like one of the red dots would be the perturbed location of that user.

356
00:17:35.629 --> 00:17:38.048
So the higher the privacy protection you can

357
00:17:38.058 --> 00:17:41.109
see the more spread out the randomized distribution.

358
00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:43.630
So the more likely the perturbed location may

359
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.530
be further away from the true location,

360
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:45.770
right.

361
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.979
So the challenge would be given these perturbed

362
00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:50.229
locations that are submitted to the server.

363
00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:52.900
How can we still figure out with some good precision

364
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.640
or accuracy that the two user is still in contact?

365
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.989
And because the most important thing for contact tracing is

366
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.349
to see whether two users are in contact or not.

367
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.829
So we did some modeling basically there

368
00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:06.949
some statistical algorithm development and so on.

369
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And we basically showed it's still feasible.

370
00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.349
It's possible to do this kind of contact tracing

371
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.630
with this privacy protection.

372
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.390
It's basically a trade off between privacy protection and

373
00:18:16.579 --> 00:18:18.040
the contact tracing utility.

374
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:18.859
And

375
00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:20.079
in terms of techniques,

376
00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:23.650
we have some techniques that demonstrates the effectiveness and so on.

377
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.930
But I would have to say this project is

378
00:18:26.229 --> 00:18:28.660
in terms of the practical deployment point of view,

379
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:30.150
it's really considered a failure

380
00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:34.635
because we promised to actually deploy some app right for the users to use.

381
00:18:34.854 --> 00:18:37.574
But it just turned out the administrative overhead in

382
00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:39.714
terms of getting the security review for the mobile

383
00:18:39.724 --> 00:18:41.724
apps and getting the IRB review and all of

384
00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:44.234
those takes so much longer than we expected.

385
00:18:44.244 --> 00:18:48.045
So by the time we are ready to roll out, essentially, the timing is just passed,

386
00:18:48.055 --> 00:18:50.344
it just doesn't make sense to do contact tracing anymore.

387
00:18:50.564 --> 00:18:53.395
So this project just ended, we have some good techniques,

388
00:18:53.405 --> 00:18:54.964
some good papers come out of it,

389
00:18:54.984 --> 00:18:59.015
but really not really a good deployment or any practical um impact.

390
00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:00.670
And then right now,

391
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.089
we are starting a new project on hyperlocal risk monitoring and

392
00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:06.020
pandemic preparedness through privacy enhanced

393
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.989
mobility and social interactions analysis.

394
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.050
So this one instead of doing the individual risk monitoring,

395
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.040
we're really interested in doing community or location based risk monitoring,

396
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.339
basically figure out what is the infection risk of a particular hyperlocal region.

397
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.430
And one of the interesting thing we want to do in this project.

398
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.530
It is a collaboration with Japan. So we want to study

399
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.839
different mobility patterns, different socio economical factors,

400
00:19:28.849 --> 00:19:29.660
cultural factors,

401
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.089
how they actually impact the disease spread and how

402
00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:35.199
they impact risk based on the mobility data.

403
00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:39.719
And of course, we want to also understand the social factors that impact the risks.

404
00:19:39.729 --> 00:19:43.650
For example, people in rural area versus in more poor areas,

405
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.339
how their mobility pattern actually changes and how they actually

406
00:19:47.349 --> 00:19:49.800
react to these different risk factors and so on.

407
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.150
So these are in collaboration with our social science collaborators.

408
00:19:53.329 --> 00:19:54.780
And of course, on the bottom,

409
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.119
we want to also build a privacy enhanced data collection

410
00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.270
aggregation so that we can enable privacy while still collecting

411
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.770
and use different kinds of data including mobility data and

412
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.270
social interaction data to enable these kinds of analysis.

413
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:07.900
So

414
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.500
I think these are the main context I have. So I think

415
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.699
Shrini

416
00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:12.939
has some questions

417
00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:16.130
and the remarks I will make probably mainly gonna be drawn from

418
00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.189
the context that I'm familiar with in terms of data access,

419
00:20:19.199 --> 00:20:20.069
data sharing

420
00:20:20.189 --> 00:20:23.150
and responsible use of the data, data privacy and so on.

421
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.579
So I look forward to also listening to other panelists

422
00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:30.109
in terms of the communication policy and operation aspects.

423
00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:30.709
Thank you.

424
00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:35.699
Thank you, Lee. I I think you nicely segued into the first question that I had

425
00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:36.189
to.

426
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.380
We were debating like brand and I were debating whether

427
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.530
we should frame it in a positive sense or negative.

428
00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:41.900
So the question was,

429
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.550
what are some of the biggest obstacles you faced during the COVID-19 response?

430
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.260
And whether any success stories,

431
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.650
I think you brought up one of the challenges that you had,

432
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.819
but maybe I'll start with you and then we can go to the other panelists.

433
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.609
Do you want to expand on some of the other obstacles or how would they overcome?

434
00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.189
Sure. Sure. Yeah.

435
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.239
So I think one of the obstacles I mentioned is the administrative

436
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:07.359
um aspect or burden which really I don't have any solution for.

437
00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:12.800
But the other major obstacles we have encountered during our projects,

438
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.040
I would say is the access to the data

439
00:21:16.869 --> 00:21:20.890
and this is not limited to the access to that raw data,

440
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.209
but it is also the access or the availability of

441
00:21:24.219 --> 00:21:28.329
fine grained or multimodal data that are actually aligned.

442
00:21:28.339 --> 00:21:32.130
So I think that's one of the major challenges I can give you some examples.

443
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.369
So for example,

444
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.829
we were trying to study the mobility data and their impact on the disease spread.

445
00:21:37.839 --> 00:21:42.229
So we actually have access to a real world mobility data through a company called VR

446
00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:46.020
set through one of our collaborators. So these are actually

447
00:21:46.189 --> 00:21:48.520
real fine grained raw mobility data.

448
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.900
However, we don't have the matching case data

449
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.599
or we don't have the matching mobility data in other countries

450
00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:57.260
like Japan if we want to do like comparative studies.

451
00:21:57.589 --> 00:22:01.469
So I think these are some of the challenges that we counter

452
00:22:01.609 --> 00:22:02.339
and

453
00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:05.410
our social scientists, for example, they can use the survey data,

454
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.459
the US long term survey data to study some of the social factors in the US.

455
00:22:09.489 --> 00:22:14.260
However, we don't really have a aligned data from other countries. Either

456
00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:16.939
they may have some other surveys in Japan,

457
00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:20.375
but they do not align in terms of time or the

458
00:22:20.385 --> 00:22:23.775
set of questions they ask the users or the participants.

459
00:22:23.944 --> 00:22:26.655
So again, this just uh created some challenges.

460
00:22:26.785 --> 00:22:27.405
And

461
00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:32.655
one of the nice thing is a lot of these service providers like Facebook and Google,

462
00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:34.925
they did release some of the data.

463
00:22:34.935 --> 00:22:37.204
However, they are in this aggregated form,

464
00:22:37.305 --> 00:22:38.574
an anonymized form.

465
00:22:38.584 --> 00:22:40.444
So again, there's alignment issues,

466
00:22:40.454 --> 00:22:42.744
there's this fine grain or granularity issues.

467
00:22:43.234 --> 00:22:46.275
So I think these are the major obstacles that we encounter

468
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.989
and some of the temporary solutions or solutions would be we

469
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.599
use simulated data for some of our studies that we published.

470
00:22:53.609 --> 00:22:56.469
And we're also trying to actually uh reaching out to ma

471
00:22:56.699 --> 00:22:57.520
and the team,

472
00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.760
I know the U VA team has a great set of simulated data that I think

473
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.849
would really benefit a lot of the study

474
00:23:04.859 --> 00:23:07.800
teams or research teams that have the multimodal,

475
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.199
very fine grain data from multiple aspects.

476
00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:13.199
So I think that is a really nice direction I

477
00:23:13.209 --> 00:23:15.359
think to enable some of the data driven research.

478
00:23:17.189 --> 00:23:17.569
OK.

479
00:23:17.579 --> 00:23:20.180
So if I understand correctly, there is on one side,

480
00:23:20.189 --> 00:23:22.359
there is challenge in aligning these multi model

481
00:23:22.369 --> 00:23:24.750
data because they're coming from different providers,

482
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.449
but also

483
00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:28.719
they're coming at different time snapshots. So

484
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.640
data collection process they're collected for totally different purposes.

485
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:35.250
So it's difficult to align them post facto.

486
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.640
And uh I really like that you highlighted another

487
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.130
use case of models as the coordinate system for

488
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.089
bringing these together in some sense.

489
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:44.199
Exactly.

490
00:23:44.449 --> 00:23:44.599
Yeah.

491
00:23:44.849 --> 00:23:45.280
Yeah,

492
00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:49.849
there are some success stories as I mentioned that this

493
00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:51.859
differential privacy is being used by the

494
00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:54.500
mobile service companies to release their data,

495
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.910
but

496
00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.130
they are in aggregated and anonymized form.

497
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.699
So the use of it might be limited and again,

498
00:23:59.709 --> 00:24:03.500
it creates challenges to align with other data, right to to link with other data.

499
00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:05.020
And then for example,

500
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:09.520
federal learning is also a I think a successful story that would allow

501
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.119
multiple data centers or health institutions to

502
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.420
answer COVID related questions for example.

503
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:18.680
But most of these I I would say is limited to the horizontal setting where

504
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.449
all the features are the same and so on, right?

505
00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:25.500
But if we have different providers who have different aspects of data,

506
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.540
like user survey data,

507
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:30.189
user behavior data and then the health records and then the mobility data,

508
00:24:30.199 --> 00:24:31.739
how do we link them together?

509
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.489
It's really a challenge

510
00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:37.400
and I know from uh working with Anna

511
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.790
and brand like I think Doctor Klein,

512
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.810
you work with a lot of hospital acquired infection related data which is at

513
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.770
level and

514
00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:47.119
maybe you also face similar challenges maybe do you wanna expand

515
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:51.150
upon other similar obstacles that you face during the COVID response?

516
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.109
Sure,

517
00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:56.630
I I think obviously the connectivity and and

518
00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:00.050
the data process was an enormous challenge,

519
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.390
right?

520
00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:04.709
And I think that that there's several dimensions to it. I I think,

521
00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:09.500
you know, obviously one aspect is being able to link mobility data with case data,

522
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.790
right?

523
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.989
And and they come in different formats that came from different places.

524
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.530
I I think part of it is also

525
00:25:15.939 --> 00:25:18.969
there was no infrastructure for doing most of this stuff

526
00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:21.449
and much of it is like gated in in private.

527
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.390
And so certain researchers would get access to this mobility data.

528
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.699
Researchers would get access to this other mobility research data set

529
00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.609
and they may or may not show the same information.

530
00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:37.050
And so I think that was always this problem of like

531
00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:41.760
how to integrate all this these different types of data,

532
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.280
which was not a problem we typically had before COVID

533
00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.140
where everyone was scrambling to get any sort of data,

534
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:48.459
right?

535
00:25:48.469 --> 00:25:49.500
And and I remember

536
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.260
it was probably 10 years ago, maybe more than that,

537
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.540
somebody had built like a very simple app where they were able

538
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:01.000
to track like a couple 100 users who like downloaded the app and

539
00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:04.229
the people agreed to do it so they could see how people actually move.

540
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.699
And I remember thinking, wow,

541
00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:10.420
this would be amazing if we could have this sort of type of data for like flu,

542
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.560
that we could see how many people moved around and

543
00:26:12.569 --> 00:26:14.839
all this stuff and we could see how flu spread.

544
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.359
And now we basically had that

545
00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:21.760
and, and it didn't really seem to actually be that useful in many cases.

546
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.099
And I, I think partly,

547
00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:25.989
you know, the problem with some of this data

548
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:30.310
beyond the fact of like, how do you get access to it? How do you correlate it is that

549
00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:34.430
it's crude cell phone movement data doesn't tell you anything

550
00:26:34.439 --> 00:26:37.000
about what the person is doing or where they are.

551
00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:39.949
So you can imagine two people being very near each other

552
00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:43.010
but having no contact or maybe they're in the same place,

553
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.670
but they're both wearing masks,

554
00:26:44.859 --> 00:26:47.829
none of that's counted and none of that's brought into the model.

555
00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:51.410
So you have to either have a data from elsewhere, you have to pull in other things.

556
00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.449
And I I think that's one of those challenges of how did, how do we deal with all of this?

557
00:26:55.459 --> 00:26:59.770
Suddenly this plethora of data that we had and to be fair to all these companies,

558
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.699
you know, these were private companies, they had

559
00:27:02.079 --> 00:27:06.719
the data model, whether you agree with their privacy implications of it or not.

560
00:27:06.729 --> 00:27:09.719
That was like the model that they had and they were building stuff around that.

561
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.270
And then suddenly many of them gave it away for

562
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.540
free to researchers in the hopes of helping this stuff,

563
00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:15.729
right?

564
00:27:15.739 --> 00:27:18.219
And now obviously most of it is that free

565
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:21.910
dumps of data have suddenly disappeared again. Right. So

566
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.640
the ability to sort of think through how to move

567
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.270
forward in terms of how to use that data and

568
00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:29.219
process that

569
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.790
the best way and build it into pipelines

570
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.949
that can be useful in the next pandemic aren't

571
00:27:33.959 --> 00:27:36.839
or even seasonal epidemics just aren't there now.

572
00:27:36.849 --> 00:27:37.109
Right.

573
00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:41.300
And so some people might have some special access and they have special DUAS,

574
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:46.530
but it's not sort of like this widely available thing that is useful for many people.

575
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:46.939
Right.

576
00:27:47.339 --> 00:27:50.800
So I think that's sort of sort of major obstacle and challenge in terms of that data.

577
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.719
It's like not just the transmission and the processing of it,

578
00:27:53.869 --> 00:27:56.000
but sort of like how do we build these pipelines to be

579
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:59.640
able to handle this data in the event of a future issue?

580
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.550
And then,

581
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:00.920
you know,

582
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:02.920
obviously the other part on top of that is

583
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.930
how do you process these enormous amounts of data?

584
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.569
So you have pro

585
00:28:06.734 --> 00:28:07.545
processing of these enormous

586
00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:09.925
OS data and then running these models. And I know

587
00:28:10.094 --> 00:28:10.494
the Bio

588
00:28:10.614 --> 00:28:14.645
Complexity Institute has like a big huge setup and built all of these stuff that,

589
00:28:14.655 --> 00:28:17.474
that was already there to be able to run these models,

590
00:28:17.665 --> 00:28:19.395
but maybe not everybody had that.

591
00:28:19.405 --> 00:28:23.415
So for instance, we would scale things up and down a little bit on, on AWS,

592
00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:26.094
but that was quite expensive. And

593
00:28:26.354 --> 00:28:30.694
there was, I'm forgetting the name of the group, the Illinois. Group champagne.

594
00:28:30.704 --> 00:28:31.755
They, they have that uh

595
00:28:31.994 --> 00:28:35.354
giant set of servers out there that they actually left.

596
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:37.609
I'm pretty sure the government paid for it somehow,

597
00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:39.589
but they were letting us use them for free.

598
00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:41.130
And then the army actually,

599
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.680
we worked with them and they actually were

600
00:28:42.689 --> 00:28:44.890
running some of our models on their servers.

601
00:28:45.469 --> 00:28:50.750
So getting access to sort of these like big computational servers on like

602
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.650
a very rapid basis was,

603
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.989
was certainly a challenge in terms of building some of

604
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.750
these bigger models and having them able to run and

605
00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:02.449
scaling them up quickly, which is, you know, we hadn't had to do in any sort of way.

606
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:09.150
So data as well as computing and also the the dental infrastructure

607
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.020
to take it from data to the computing systems and so on.

608
00:29:12.349 --> 00:29:14.939
I think they're pretty much in the span of the

609
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.949
size which is supporting this expeditions sometimes.

610
00:29:17.959 --> 00:29:22.569
Like I think a lot of the discussion that we have had in the past workshops and also in

611
00:29:22.729 --> 00:29:25.810
some of the discussion groups hint towards these challenges,

612
00:29:25.819 --> 00:29:27.829
like how do we codify them, Justin,

613
00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:31.540
do you want to add something on this topic before we go to the next question?

614
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.410
Yeah, definitely.

615
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:39.290
And I think I definitely have a different angle on it, but kind of the same issue

616
00:29:39.479 --> 00:29:41.709
working for the state,

617
00:29:42.729 --> 00:29:45.650
really, a lot of our data systems are really siloed.

618
00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:50.680
So our funding for our data systems tends to be grant based and grants tend to be

619
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.550
uh very specific in what they try to do.

620
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.319
So we might have a grant for providing vaccines.

621
00:29:56.329 --> 00:29:59.020
We have a separate grant for surveillance and cases,

622
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.099
another one for uh outbreak investigations

623
00:30:02.699 --> 00:30:04.859
and those grants tend to be very silent.

624
00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:07.260
So the the data systems have been built around

625
00:30:07.364 --> 00:30:09.114
those specific functions.

626
00:30:09.354 --> 00:30:11.505
So they don't always collect data in the same way.

627
00:30:11.515 --> 00:30:14.285
The data isn't generally always interoperable

628
00:30:14.535 --> 00:30:17.025
and they're not really linked and they're also, you know,

629
00:30:17.035 --> 00:30:20.925
built for a much smaller scale than we had to do during the pandemic.

630
00:30:20.935 --> 00:30:26.415
So we had to ramp up really quickly these data systems that, that don't

631
00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:28.824
really talk to each other very well.

632
00:30:29.949 --> 00:30:30.560
And,

633
00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:32.869
and they're built really for a much smaller scale.

634
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.869
You're talking maybe hundreds of cases and not tens of thousands at a time.

635
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.800
So try to bring a lot of people on board who

636
00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.359
are also siloed in their training and they're working with,

637
00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:42.439
with systems.

638
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.569
So that was a very difficult thing to do. We're also trying to get data from

639
00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:51.119
hospitals, health care providers,

640
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.540
laboratories that are also getting swamped with work and, and data requirements.

641
00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:58.020
So a lot of the data systems that we had in place,

642
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.160
the fields weren't getting filled in, all the fields weren't getting filled in it.

643
00:31:01.569 --> 00:31:04.560
At first. It's, it's, it's definitely understandable. Um

644
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.439
We had to, you know, work pretty hard to get our hospitals and health systems.

645
00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:09.609
They were, they were very cooper,

646
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.680
you know, essential during the pandemic.

647
00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:13.560
Uh but they were getting swamped as well.

648
00:31:13.569 --> 00:31:16.839
So trying to worry about collecting the data that they needed

649
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:20.959
was difficult and a lot of that data is proprietary and

650
00:31:20.969 --> 00:31:24.250
we work through our Virginia Hospital and health care associate.

651
00:31:24.614 --> 00:31:28.405
So it's a little like herding cats to get permission to share that data

652
00:31:28.645 --> 00:31:30.734
during a busy time period. So

653
00:31:31.255 --> 00:31:35.864
getting all those data systems built up, getting collection instruments built up,

654
00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:40.005
getting the people who are using those systems to fill out all the fields.

655
00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:43.765
In some, some cases, we eventually just made them required. You couldn't submit,

656
00:31:43.925 --> 00:31:47.084
say your test report without filling and race and ethnicity.

657
00:31:47.469 --> 00:31:49.520
But we had to build up to that and have policy

658
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:53.099
changes and really analysis and understanding of what was going on

659
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.780
in order to get there. So,

660
00:31:56.699 --> 00:31:57.119
you know,

661
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.839
and I think one of the other things that we struggled with

662
00:31:59.849 --> 00:32:03.000
early on with something we've talked about is is data privacy.

663
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.660
So our inclination is to really uh protect

664
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.880
that that private health information during a public.

665
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:09.609
And one of the

666
00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:13.800
one of the ways we do that is to not share data with everyone, you know, to keep it

667
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:13.930
uh

668
00:32:14.209 --> 00:32:14.920
separate.

669
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.989
So at a time when you really need to ramp up

670
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.469
your analysis and work with partners like the U VA Bio

671
00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:20.339
Complexity Institute,

672
00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:24.000
kind of breaking down that culture and and understanding how to do it

673
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.550
while protecting ph I but meeting the needs of this new emergency.

674
00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.310
I think that was something a challenge that we face very early in the pandemic.

675
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.959
So it's interesting that you highlight the

676
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.729
data collection process because I think while smartphones and other

677
00:32:39.739 --> 00:32:43.199
sensors allow us to do passive data collection at scale.

678
00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:43.250
A

679
00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.810
lot of these systems are at like hospitals

680
00:32:45.819 --> 00:32:48.079
or clinics where people are getting diagnosed.

681
00:32:48.089 --> 00:32:50.689
There, there is a human element to this data collection. So

682
00:32:50.949 --> 00:32:53.160
asking them to fill out multiple fields,

683
00:32:53.285 --> 00:32:55.185
requires a human to go through that.

684
00:32:55.364 --> 00:32:58.425
And there's a, there's a lot of the question on whether these systems will

685
00:32:58.555 --> 00:33:03.114
stay or how, how will they evolve after the phes expire?

686
00:33:03.285 --> 00:33:03.625
So,

687
00:33:03.655 --> 00:33:06.324
so that's a very valuable thing to keep in mind

688
00:33:06.334 --> 00:33:09.185
as modelers and also as people who consume the data,

689
00:33:09.194 --> 00:33:12.974
we need to really see whether a particular data collection system

690
00:33:13.255 --> 00:33:15.025
is giving us the

691
00:33:15.155 --> 00:33:18.064
required benefit and try to downscale it.

692
00:33:18.074 --> 00:33:21.415
Keeping in mind the human cost and the infrastructure costs in mind.

693
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:25.589
So we have like maybe 5, 10 minutes before we jump into the next session.

694
00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:28.229
I wanna open it up for audience if they have

695
00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:31.099
any questions in the main room or others on zoom.

696
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:33.650
All right.

697
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:37.199
So um Justin, I was thinking about what you said for this question,

698
00:33:37.209 --> 00:33:38.630
but everyone could chime in

699
00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.540
I I in our breakout group, we were thinking about what,

700
00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:46.739
what was the advantage of modeling or how did you learn to trust it

701
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.359
or trust these nuts from bio

702
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.219
complexity. We were there things that you wished

703
00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:55.170
the modelers had known going in or how, how did that work?

704
00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:58.369
And what might you change in terms of the perspective of us modelers?

705
00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.209
Like, what should we be thinking about

706
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.770
next time this happens and have to work with someone like you or decision makers.

707
00:34:07.109 --> 00:34:07.400
Yeah.

708
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.800
Well, I think from the onset they were very clear about what the projections were,

709
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.199
that they weren't predictions and that's

710
00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:18.409
immediately what any person who's not familiar with the forecast thinks it's,

711
00:34:18.418 --> 00:34:20.080
it's a prediction, it's a crystal ball.

712
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:22.429
We're trying to tell you exactly what's going to happen,

713
00:34:22.438 --> 00:34:25.090
the exact number of cases and when they're going to peak.

714
00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:25.590
So,

715
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.129
so I think the U VA team was great at really, uh you know,

716
00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:31.770
stating that these are projections,

717
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.330
we can't tell you exactly what the level is going to be when

718
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.100
it's going to peak and explaining the different scenarios and what they meant.

719
00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:43.350
And really what they did was they really gave it an inaction

720
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.350
thing, you know.

721
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.300
So with,

722
00:34:45.428 --> 00:34:48.228
at the field hospital, as I mentioned before, what they ended up saying was,

723
00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:51.618
you know, we can give you six weeks notice if you need to set up a field hospital.

724
00:34:51.628 --> 00:34:53.388
So they weren't overstating what they could do,

725
00:34:53.398 --> 00:34:56.868
but they were stating really what the state could do

726
00:34:56.878 --> 00:35:00.229
with the information that uh U VA was able to provide

727
00:35:00.358 --> 00:35:01.229
if that makes sense.

728
00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:04.398
So they were really providing something actionable and something that

729
00:35:05.049 --> 00:35:08.479
the governor could hang his hat on or the governor or his team,

730
00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.739
her COVID leadership team

731
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:15.620
could hang their hat on as supporting that decision and allowing the team to take a,

732
00:35:15.629 --> 00:35:16.679
a definite action.

733
00:35:17.399 --> 00:35:19.379
So I think those two things to combine,

734
00:35:19.389 --> 00:35:22.739
not overstating and then giving something concrete to do and

735
00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.060
what that information can let you do is very helpful.

736
00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.139
All right, thanks.

737
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:32.239
I think one of the other things that we have as an issue around

738
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.620
that same idea is is sort of the question of scale versus risk,

739
00:35:36.629 --> 00:35:37.060
right?

740
00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:37.679
And so

741
00:35:38.129 --> 00:35:42.510
just when you're talking about how far in the future, you could maybe look to say,

742
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.709
well, maybe this is when we might need something.

743
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.889
And that's sort of at the state level,

744
00:35:46.899 --> 00:35:50.593
like I spent some of my time or a lot of significant working

745
00:35:50.603 --> 00:35:55.663
with the specific hospital and the questions there were much more localized.

746
00:35:55.673 --> 00:36:00.433
So there wasn't as much at the state level, but at the like more local Baltimore level

747
00:36:00.603 --> 00:36:04.353
and how, how would things play out there versus at the country level?

748
00:36:04.363 --> 00:36:04.613
And I,

749
00:36:04.623 --> 00:36:07.472
I think one of the things that we have this problem with

750
00:36:07.482 --> 00:36:10.952
in terms of modeling is the models can be actually pretty good

751
00:36:11.055 --> 00:36:11.585
at sort of an

752
00:36:11.785 --> 00:36:14.335
aggregate because they're regression to the mean,

753
00:36:14.345 --> 00:36:16.736
you're looking at large numbers and you have this,

754
00:36:16.746 --> 00:36:21.176
the SAR models then start to look pretty good when you aggregate to

755
00:36:21.426 --> 00:36:24.456
the, you know, the state or even the national level.

756
00:36:24.466 --> 00:36:26.176
But when you start looking at these local levels,

757
00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:29.416
you get all these little peaks and curves and a lot of randomness.

758
00:36:29.426 --> 00:36:31.815
And how do you use that at a like

759
00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:39.139
local level to assess risk for a hospital or assess risk for a county or, and,

760
00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:41.800
and I think one of the other big challenges is that a

761
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.459
lot of these case numbers that were reported and

762
00:36:44.469 --> 00:36:47.350
all that stuff again were aggregated to some extent.

763
00:36:47.429 --> 00:36:51.645
And those aggregations may or may not have any relationship to the epidemiology,

764
00:36:51.655 --> 00:36:51.965
right?

765
00:36:51.975 --> 00:36:52.804
So, you know,

766
00:36:52.814 --> 00:36:55.215
where some zip codes or counties might cross over between

767
00:36:55.225 --> 00:36:57.645
two different populations that don't have a lot of contact.

768
00:36:57.695 --> 00:36:58.405
And so

769
00:36:58.584 --> 00:37:00.044
those problems as well,

770
00:37:00.054 --> 00:37:05.725
which I think dealing with communicating those issues was a constant challenge.

771
00:37:05.735 --> 00:37:06.344
And then I think

772
00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:10.159
you guys got lucky because Justin seems to understand

773
00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:12.770
what a scenario is versus a forecast versus,

774
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.679
you know, a prediction.

775
00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:17.199
Whereas we got yelled at by the governor's office because we,

776
00:37:17.209 --> 00:37:20.860
even though a model which showed when the peak would be the peak was too high,

777
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:24.600
so they were, they were upset, how should we ever trust you again?

778
00:37:26.149 --> 00:37:29.729
But again, like that was, you know, 68 weeks out, you know, the models growing up,

779
00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:30.110
you know, it's,

780
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.590
it's sort of like dealing with people that don't understand that difference

781
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.989
between sort of a prediction versus a scenario versus the forecast,

782
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.649
those sorts of things can be quite complicated.

783
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.110
And if you don't have those connections built up on beforehand

784
00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.659
or you don't have somebody who you can work with directly,

785
00:37:45.669 --> 00:37:49.830
you can understand that that makes it quite difficult to be in this space and,

786
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.550
and be useful in this space.

787
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.100
I think any to your point,

788
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:55.879
no one can make borders,

789
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.479
but I think you need to get a

790
00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:00.540
recipient on the other side who

791
00:38:00.679 --> 00:38:02.909
cares about it too. And, and I think

792
00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:04.050
they said it,

793
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.250
we were one of the lucky states that our

794
00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:08.370
state uh leadership and,

795
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.899
and this

796
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.469
just in another

797
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.610
to take this into consideration,

798
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.370
many other states were not

799
00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:16.639
that I think at the at

800
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.189
least case you

801
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.449
probably could present

802
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.260
it in other states, they are downright barred from producing models,

803
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.280
right? So

804
00:38:23.739 --> 00:38:24.729
I think it was a happy

805
00:38:25.379 --> 00:38:25.699
influence

806
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:25.949
of

807
00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:30.110
we could do the modeling, but we had an audience that was willing to listen.

808
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:30.939
And

809
00:38:31.129 --> 00:38:31.750
even with the

810
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.810
caveat stated, they are willing to take it in the right spirit.

811
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.080
They did not force us to keep saying, you know,

812
00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.010
forecast what's gonna happen otherwise your model is no birthday.

813
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.770
So I, I would thank them as well in

814
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:44.889
class

815
00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:45.239
mostly.

816
00:38:47.989 --> 00:38:48.060
So

817
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:49.969
this is not to be the case,

818
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.560
we really want sometimes to know things that are

819
00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:55.550
not within the purview of the modern to talk.

820
00:38:55.929 --> 00:38:56.669
They're willing to,

821
00:38:56.909 --> 00:38:59.479
you know, take the answer that, you know, I don't think we can do it.

822
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.010
You get to say something about that.

823
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.139
I think the other big challenge was was how to align,

824
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.689
what the models, which I think you're speaking to,

825
00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:12.780
how to align with the models could do and what the models could,

826
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:16.479
could evaluate with the policy options that were available at the

827
00:39:16.489 --> 00:39:19.409
state level or the county level or the hospital level.

828
00:39:19.419 --> 00:39:23.419
So we were asked at some point to look at modeling the impact of closing schools,

829
00:39:23.429 --> 00:39:23.939
like what would be

830
00:39:24.044 --> 00:39:27.784
that impact or modeling the impact of closing restaurants.

831
00:39:27.995 --> 00:39:31.544
And, and again, those have significant economic consequences and,

832
00:39:31.554 --> 00:39:32.514
and significant

833
00:39:32.645 --> 00:39:33.445
implications.

834
00:39:33.455 --> 00:39:36.044
And we're doing the best we can to retrofit

835
00:39:36.054 --> 00:39:39.024
the models to look at these types of specific

836
00:39:39.274 --> 00:39:40.304
events which, you know,

837
00:39:40.314 --> 00:39:43.745
may or may not have been originally built into some of the models.

838
00:39:44.264 --> 00:39:47.054
Um And so those types of activities can be

839
00:39:47.399 --> 00:39:52.389
I think fruitful but also difficult and I think we're sort of looking forward,

840
00:39:52.399 --> 00:39:54.360
I think some of those things need to be thought

841
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.939
through and better able to be communicated so that when,

842
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.060
if there is something that does come along, you're able to say, well,

843
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.129
here are the potential policy options we've

844
00:40:05.139 --> 00:40:07.239
thought through what we could possibly do.

845
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.090
Here's what the potential implications of

846
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.580
those are from an epidemiological perspective.

847
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.479
And then, you know, you can layer on other aspects like

848
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.979
-- economics and, and other things on top
-- of that

849
00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:21.909
thanks to Dave Higden for launching this question because I think

850
00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:24.550
it's covered a lot of the topics that we wanted to

851
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.250
hit on in terms of learning lessons from the past.

852
00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.889
Because challenges in communication in general,

853
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:33.189
like communicating across different audience is difficult and

854
00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:35.729
especially at times of high uncertainty like this

855
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
and with data limitations. And also we are talking very different languages

856
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.909
and to do this with carrying the plus forward, like models can say

857
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.020
one thing based on the data three months later, the data changes.

858
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.949
And so the models need to adapt. So such communication

859
00:40:52.229 --> 00:40:56.760
needs to be in sync with what the data is rather than just sticking to your guns.

860
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:57.449
What you said

861
00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.100
one year back if new data comes in and variants

862
00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.899
have been a very good example of that fully vaccinated status

863
00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.370
and then boosters were becoming necessary when

864
00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:08.610
Han came in. How do you

865
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.679
convince the entire set of population who has gotten fully vaccinated and

866
00:41:11.689 --> 00:41:14.530
thought it was over to go out there and get another dose?

867
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.810
So I think you've highlighted a lot of these.

868
00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.280
So maybe in the remaining time, we can go to the forward looking parts.

869
00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.780
So one of the questions we had was

870
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:26.820
based on all the lessons you have learned and obstacles you have faced.

871
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.219
How should teams,

872
00:41:28.229 --> 00:41:31.850
partnerships and consortiums and you can call it anything but how

873
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.040
should they be set up to better handle future pandemic response?

874
00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.760
And you can take it from like within academics

875
00:41:38.919 --> 00:41:41.530
or like academic industry or academic industry

876
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.370
and government response or even citizen science.

877
00:41:44.649 --> 00:41:46.860
So you can think of it in any ways like, but

878
00:41:46.989 --> 00:41:49.459
lee do you want to get started? And then others can chime in?

879
00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:56.340
I actually don't have a good answer to this. I think it's like a very lofty goal.

880
00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.909
I would love to hear what other panelists are thinking.

881
00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:05.600
You know, I I'm very excited that the redeemed Department of Health has,

882
00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:07.800
has set up this foresight and analytics

883
00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.600
unit within the Office of Emergency Preparedness.

884
00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:15.699
And the goal I think with that is is to maintain these types of Cor

885
00:42:15.969 --> 00:42:16.040
Scor

886
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.879
MS, these types of relationships that we built up during the pandemic,

887
00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:23.899
particularly with the U VA team and with the meta that the forecasting meta

888
00:42:24.149 --> 00:42:25.510
forecasting platform

889
00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:29.610
and really to tie them to policy decisions. Like we discussed,

890
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.139
one of the things that I think we need

891
00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:35.899
is to have structures in place data governance structures.

892
00:42:35.909 --> 00:42:37.060
A lot of it is,

893
00:42:37.179 --> 00:42:37.770
you know,

894
00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.330
some of the technical challenges we can get enough scientists and engineers on it.

895
00:42:42.689 --> 00:42:44.459
Uh they can solve a problem,

896
00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:47.669
a lot of its governance issue. A lot of it is coordinations

897
00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:50.889
as I call them getting everyone on the same page and and agreeing

898
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:52.350
to do certain things.

899
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.270
So having those a process in place for data sharing, whether it's continuous

900
00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.590
or just something that you can ramp up

901
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.050
quickly based on certain thresholds or certain needs.

902
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.100
I think it is essential.

903
00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.209
So having those tools in place,

904
00:43:07.219 --> 00:43:10.110
having people who are familiar with the data sets to begin with.

905
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.780
So I think having a team

906
00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:16.050
able to work with the data from the get go is very important

907
00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.929
and having a pipeline of students, I I'm a very big fan of having

908
00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:22.510
applied research units, got like your team uh

909
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.209
like bio

910
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:26.000
complexity and student, having students have applied a

911
00:43:26.169 --> 00:43:30.810
portion of their, you know, whether it's an internship or just a uh a practicum

912
00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.459
working with a public health

913
00:43:32.854 --> 00:43:34.205
are in the field somehow.

914
00:43:34.215 --> 00:43:35.935
Uh and getting an understanding of,

915
00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:38.925
of how things work in a practical and an applied setting

916
00:43:39.195 --> 00:43:41.885
where I think it's very different than in an academic setting when you,

917
00:43:41.895 --> 00:43:43.334
when you tend to have, you know, at that point,

918
00:43:43.344 --> 00:43:46.165
cleaner data sets and cleaner questions

919
00:43:46.604 --> 00:43:48.475
and cleaner uh assignments.

920
00:43:49.215 --> 00:43:51.094
So having all those systems in place,

921
00:43:51.104 --> 00:43:55.054
I think it is very important and uh hopefully we can build that going forward.

922
00:43:56.139 --> 00:43:56.830
I think

923
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.919
that the efforts have to be at different levels and, and I think there's some

924
00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:03.379
thing that is going on, right?

925
00:44:03.389 --> 00:44:07.919
So like the CDC and HHS are pushing this

926
00:44:07.929 --> 00:44:10.300
forecasting center and that whatever they're calling it.

927
00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:10.939
But that,

928
00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:12.989
that is like an actual funded thing where

929
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.050
there's going to be constant funding for that,

930
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.949
which I think is going to be good at,

931
00:44:16.959 --> 00:44:22.020
at an overall level it's gonna push a lot of efforts in, in that direction, in terms of

932
00:44:22.479 --> 00:44:25.010
building some of this capacity, having it built up.

933
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.620
But I think Center for Forecasting Analytics. Thank you,

934
00:44:27.899 --> 00:44:28.010
you know,

935
00:44:29.149 --> 00:44:30.939
but again, you know, like that's

936
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.659
going to be the this question of scale and utility, right?

937
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:38.139
Those numbers, if you're telling

938
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:42.409
Virginia that the peak of the epidemic is gonna be in

939
00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.379
January, but it actually is gonna peak

940
00:44:44.575 --> 00:44:46.716
in Virginia in December.

941
00:44:46.775 --> 00:44:50.206
That's important information that might not come through. Well.

942
00:44:50.226 --> 00:44:52.775
And so I think that it's important for this national stuff,

943
00:44:52.785 --> 00:44:54.355
but I think some of it has to be more

944
00:44:54.365 --> 00:44:57.105
at the local level and building these local partnerships.

945
00:44:57.226 --> 00:44:57.926
So that

946
00:44:58.355 --> 00:45:03.605
as you said, that data is messy, but also the the process of science is messy, right?

947
00:45:03.615 --> 00:45:06.345
And so the process of building these models is messy and I

948
00:45:06.451 --> 00:45:08.471
part of the thing that needs to be thought

949
00:45:08.481 --> 00:45:11.271
about is that whatever the next pandemic is,

950
00:45:11.281 --> 00:45:13.612
it's not gonna be exactly like this one.

951
00:45:13.872 --> 00:45:18.511
And so thinking through what could be the additional challenges that might be

952
00:45:18.521 --> 00:45:23.191
needed and what additional data streams might be needed at some point.

953
00:45:23.201 --> 00:45:28.352
It is something that I think is what we need to be able to work towards.

954
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:33.870
And then I think the Real World II, I spent a lot of time, my time looking at E hr data and

955
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.830
if you want to talk about messi that, that's messy, right?

956
00:45:36.959 --> 00:45:40.870
And it's very gated and very localized and, and even in like Maryland,

957
00:45:40.879 --> 00:45:42.790
where we've got this highly connected system,

958
00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.649
you can get sort of some access at a clinical level to stuff across the region.

959
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.679
It's really hard to get that data at a

960
00:45:48.689 --> 00:45:52.389
clinical level or communicated across the multiple places.

961
00:45:52.685 --> 00:45:54.304
And I'm not trying to say we should knock

962
00:45:54.314 --> 00:45:56.205
all those barriers down because they're certainly important.

963
00:45:56.364 --> 00:45:57.584
But it's a question of how to

964
00:45:57.995 --> 00:46:00.185
deal with those privacy issues and, and

965
00:46:00.425 --> 00:46:01.334
H A issues

966
00:46:01.445 --> 00:46:04.504
in a very similar way that we have to deal with the mobile phone stuff, right?

967
00:46:04.514 --> 00:46:06.854
It's like how do you use this data which can be highly

968
00:46:06.885 --> 00:46:11.415
useful in this context but have significant privacy concerns in other arenas.

969
00:46:11.425 --> 00:46:16.054
And how do you put that those streams together and start using that in a way that can be

970
00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:21.689
actionable i in a way that can influence policy and policy can influence it back.

971
00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:25.110
And I think that that has to start at the national level like it is,

972
00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.879
but I think you have to build these things at the

973
00:46:26.889 --> 00:46:30.000
local level as well so that there's local buy in.

974
00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.290
And, you know, I I think one of the things we saw was that

975
00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:35.300
each state had a different team that they were working with

976
00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:38.620
and those teams didn't always have high levels of communication.

977
00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.050
So

978
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:44.149
I've spoken with Brian several times about different parts of it, but we didn't like

979
00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.104
look at details of our model and compare that

980
00:46:47.114 --> 00:46:50.405
and drive how the differences might affect things and,

981
00:46:50.415 --> 00:46:54.745
and I, I don't think that's because we didn't want to or wouldn't have liked to,

982
00:46:55.175 --> 00:46:55.905
you know, it was time,

983
00:46:55.915 --> 00:46:59.574
like we always just wasn't time to do all of that stuff and provide those things.

984
00:46:59.584 --> 00:47:03.264
And so we're having some of that stuff built up in terms of like communication

985
00:47:03.274 --> 00:47:08.364
across teams as well as communication at the local level would be of high utility.

986
00:47:08.395 --> 00:47:11.655
The hard part is, is how to marshal that I think now

987
00:47:11.945 --> 00:47:15.665
and in the next couple of years as the emergency ends and and people's

988
00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:20.709
are working 60 80 90 hours a week and they aren't focused on.

989
00:47:20.719 --> 00:47:23.520
This is the only problem and some new emergency shows up.

990
00:47:24.159 --> 00:47:27.020
How do we continue to build that capacity and keep those

991
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.770
lines open while dealing with whatever the newest thing is?

992
00:47:32.419 --> 00:47:35.840
Yeah, I think you bring up a very important point of data stewards in some sense,

993
00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.340
different entities, the data sites in different locations.

994
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:39.820
I think

995
00:47:40.179 --> 00:47:42.939
again, like mother and others can attest to this fact for

996
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.370
when we were trying to do like campus level modeling,

997
00:47:45.379 --> 00:47:48.489
there are different aspects of the campus that we would like to capture and

998
00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.350
there are units that are

999
00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:51.959
housing those data, but

1000
00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:55.030
they are say inside the library or some other unit like that.

1001
00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.820
That's not very evident like when we start looking for it. And

1002
00:47:58.139 --> 00:48:00.340
I think Lee maybe you have some insights on

1003
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.120
on the industry front since you've worked with a lot of partners and they have

1004
00:48:04.239 --> 00:48:04.250
a

1005
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.389
I I don't know, like I in some sense,

1006
00:48:06.399 --> 00:48:11.080
they are used to monetizing the data or collecting data on more passive scale.

1007
00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.030
So maybe you have some thoughts on how such practices

1008
00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.419
can be brought in in terms of data stewards and

1009
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:19.100
being able to interlink them as and when needed.

1010
00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:22.080
Yeah.

1011
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.850
In the data privacy community, actually,

1012
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.879
there's been a lot of discussion and even research into this direction,

1013
00:48:27.889 --> 00:48:29.040
how to monetize

1014
00:48:29.169 --> 00:48:33.899
or basically making data into a market, right? Data essentially is the value

1015
00:48:34.189 --> 00:48:37.260
and instead of a binary decision for privacy protection,

1016
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.780
we don't share the data or with some kind of data privacy solutions essentially just

1017
00:48:41.909 --> 00:48:45.000
giving a balance between the privacy protection and

1018
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:46.979
the utility and the value of the data.

1019
00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:48.649
But another way kind of a so the

1020
00:48:48.939 --> 00:48:51.719
way is to think of the data as a value as

1021
00:48:52.399 --> 00:48:55.250
a monetized value, you can actually trade the data,

1022
00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.479
you can either trade the raw data or you can trade the core results or

1023
00:48:58.489 --> 00:49:02.560
you can trade the machine learning model that like derived products from the data.

1024
00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:06.399
So there are actually emerging research that are going on in this area.

1025
00:49:06.669 --> 00:49:10.070
But in terms of how far is it from realizing it

1026
00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.219
and to get the industry by in that, I

1027
00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.419
guess that's not very clear

1028
00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:17.209
in the horizon.

1029
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.919
I mean the the companies probably sell it under the table under the market. But

1030
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.129
there's no, I guess no,

1031
00:49:25.219 --> 00:49:27.429
it's not the infrastructure or mechanism

1032
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.409
or transparency that are available yet for the

1033
00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:32.090
public health agencies to go to the company,

1034
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:33.780
for example, to say, OK, let's

1035
00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:38.459
there are certain needs of the data. Is there any way to actually get access to data?

1036
00:49:38.469 --> 00:49:42.479
So yeah, I think there's still a way to go in order for us to get there.

1037
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.689
But that's definitely, I think a promising direction.

1038
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.669
Yeah,

1039
00:49:46.679 --> 00:49:51.229
I think that that's come to the forefront how to get the data where it needs to be and

1040
00:49:51.419 --> 00:49:54.879
be able to translate it into the decision makers needs.

1041
00:49:55.219 --> 00:49:55.770
So

1042
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.709
anything that we can build in terms

1043
00:49:57.719 --> 00:50:00.080
of either infrastructure but also partnerships that

1044
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.129
there's a human infrastructure to be built out, there's a compute

1045
00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:07.649
side of it. So anything that we can do in that direction would be very helpful.

1046
00:50:07.909 --> 00:50:09.129
I'd like to thank again,

1047
00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:12.060
all the panelists for their valuable insights and all the work

1048
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:14.850
that they've done over the past two years and continue to do

1049
00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:18.899
even as new variants keep showing up and with monkey pox in the news.

1050
00:50:18.909 --> 00:50:24.040
So I'd like to thank all the panelists and all the audience for sticking around

1051
00:50:24.399 --> 00:50:25.290
this long day

1052
00:50:25.429 --> 00:50:25.979
and all

1053
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:26.689
your questions.
