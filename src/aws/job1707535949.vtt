WEBVTT

0
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.140
OK,

1
00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:05.739
so now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.960
Um Does anyone have any

3
00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.340
concrete proposals or do we want to just

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.520
go through people and start placing them and kind of discuss as we go along?

5
00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:24.120
I don't think there a re concrete proposals

6
00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:26.579
but no,

7
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.829
it's kind of

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.040
we should

9
00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.189
maybe find a method to do

10
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.310
stuff

11
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.250
like I don't know, choose

12
00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:36.909
one para meter,

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.479
the first para meter to choose people to choose where to put people

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.250
like

15
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.549
I dunno, maybe permanent staff and non permanent stuff.

16
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.279
We know that professor will stay for a long time.

17
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:53.509
We a re we don't know for the other.

18
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.509
Yeah, that's true.

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.139
Maybe that could be the first para meter to take into account. Not just to,

20
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.940
-- yeah, give them like the
-- most comfortable offices and

21
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.330
-- yeah
-- and have this discussion every two years.

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.860
Yeah,

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.790
because it's

24
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.989
do you know?

25
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:13.349
Yeah, this makes sense.

26
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.790
That makes sense for everyone. So we can choose where to put.

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.849
Uh I would say the the the three

28
00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:25.430
-- first one of the
-- list. Yeah, cause Martin's a professor but he's only here half time.

29
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.019
So it's sort of a different situation.

30
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.889
He's a professor at the PFL, but not

31
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.150
in Geneva. He just does research in Geneva

32
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.510
and maybe the two other senior

33
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.989
Andre and Nancy.

34
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.360
Okay. So, let's

35
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.069
go through that first.

36
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.949
Um,

37
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.660
so what do you think for, uh,

38
00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.029
Susan and Maggie, for example, the,

39
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.870
the rooms for one person?

40
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.800
Yeah,

41
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.099
-- for
-- Susan probably acting. She prefers to have her own office.

42
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.919
Um,

43
00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:06.959
okay. Any preference as to which one?

44
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.639
Not really.

45
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100
We'll put Susan here for now. They can switch

46
00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.830
and then Maggie and the other one. Yeah. Yeah,

47
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.619
it's up to them, I guess. Yeah.

48
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.100
No, it's up to,

49
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.699
up to

50
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:22.500
u si mean, they, they can switch,

51
00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.350
they can switch later.

52
00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.990
Um,

53
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.860
ok.

54
00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.220
And then

55
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.160
play right next.

56
00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:38.669
So we need to put Pierre

57
00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.050
Andre and Nancy.

58
00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:45.110
Do we want to, the, the question is now, is, do we want to put the three together

59
00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.839
or the three completely separate

60
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.119
with

61
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.270
other people?

62
00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:53.210
Um,

63
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.850
I would say not together.

64
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:56.240
Inp

65
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.050
has students

66
00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.509
and Andre and Nancy don't, well,

67
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.750
does

68
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:01.059
Andre.

69
00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:04.869
Yeah, but few

70
00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.779
less than pure.

71
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.869
So we have

72
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.399
because also if we're going to put people together by projects and there's

73
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.229
no sense to put them together because they all work on different projects.

74
00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.479
I know.

75
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.649
Um, I just realised something,

76
00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:31.800
the two people room in the middle which has only one windows,

77
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.669
it's gonna be pretty hard to put two people inside that room

78
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.770
because they'll fight for the window.

79
00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.199
It's quite dark.

80
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.550
What about moving Gisela in there?

81
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.539
If she's in there half the time she can have her desk near the window and, ok,

82
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.710
she's not near the mailbox but,

83
00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:52.130
and near the

84
00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.779
photocopy,

85
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.860
but it may be more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people.

86
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.539
Yeah.

87
00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:00.339
Yeah, it would be nicer.

88
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.089
And what about the reading room?

89
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.229
-- But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading or more,
-- I, I

90
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.990
you,

91
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.259
I mean

92
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.240
uh I think everybody is supposed to spend more

93
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.480
time in the office than in the reading room.

94
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.390
So we might think that it's better to

95
00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.959
have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable

96
00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:25.269
reading room. I don't know,

97
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.920
it changed the plan of the morning. I'm sorry, but

98
00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:30.450
I just realise that stupid architect

99
00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:32.029
put on the one windows

100
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.130
who built this building. Do we know that?

101
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.049
I don't know.

102
00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.029
I dunno,

103
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.000
do you think?

104
00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:42.410
-- I
-- dunno, we spent

105
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.940
quite some time a t the last meeting and to decide this

106
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.820
just

107
00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:49.959
took attention a t this

108
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.559
one windows problem

109
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.570
and I think it is one problem,

110
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.109
of course,

111
00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:57.589
but everybody had the documents before so you could have studied them.

112
00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279
I

113
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.160
say

114
00:04:59.299 --> 00:04:59.320
the

115
00:04:59.489 --> 00:04:59.649
sa me

116
00:04:59.799 --> 00:04:59.959
to

117
00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:00.350
you.

118
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.950
What if we put the two people that a re 50% in that room

119
00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:07.070
-- in the,
-- the two A PFL people

120
00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:10.019
that's really welcoming and warming,

121
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.149
-- but they're
-- only here 50%.

122
00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:16.089
Well, let's uh how we can uh fill the three person rooms.

123
00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:19.299
What, what, what,

124
00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.690
uh,

125
00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:25.200
how we can, who we gonna put in the three person rooms. I mean, we have now,

126
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.079
uh, 23 person rooms left.

127
00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:29.519
And, um,

128
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.679
no, no, but the main problem, we have the sa me number of

129
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.519
places and the sa me number of people now. So everyone has to go somewhere.

130
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.690
Yeah.

131
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.709
And, uh, I just noticed that we have these two

132
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.920
people room,

133
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.730
we

134
00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:46.140
have

135
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.529
one

136
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.119
-- room with two windows. I
-- don't mind going into this office

137
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.570
you don't mind to have.

138
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.000
Okay. So

139
00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.170
Nikos

140
00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:55.809
and

141
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.570
you have to sign. Yeah, you have to find somebody agree to come with you

142
00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:02.670
and it's not a question of you. It's a question of windows.

143
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.489
Who would you put with you?

144
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.750
Let's put a 50%. So,

145
00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:14.250
oh, why not?

146
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.079
Okay?

147
00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:17.440
From the?

148
00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.290
OK. So that's

149
00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:19.160
in there.

150
00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.470
Yeah. Do you not have it? No,

151
00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:24.359
-- you will learn to know
-- it. You'll meet him.

152
00:06:26.549 --> 00:06:27.049
OK.

153
00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:28.910
So

154
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.989
I'm just gonna

155
00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.790
make a list on here of who we have

156
00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:40.109
and keep talking.

157
00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:42.109
So David and Nichols it's done.

158
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.579
And

159
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.279
so where were we? Uh and Nancy Andre

160
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.570
and

161
00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:50.059
Nancy

162
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.970
maybe we can put pet

163
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.760
and her T 22 phd students into one room.

164
00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:02.790
Yeah. Why not?

165
00:07:03.799 --> 00:07:05.929
How many phd students did you have

166
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.140
all two Marians or?

167
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.540
And me?

168
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.700
And

169
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:11.940
you

170
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.119
can

171
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.670
say,

172
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.160
OK,

173
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.750
so

174
00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:15.130
I'm

175
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.429
doing

176
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.160
a phd

177
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:19.660
officially.

178
00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:22.670
Um

179
00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:29.649
OK, so David Nikos,

180
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.260
Gisela

181
00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.579
Maggie and Susan are done.

182
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.750
Ok.

183
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.600
So, and could you put the, the map again? So we,

184
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.809
so what happened?

185
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.320
Um,

186
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.329
that's, that might be a good idea to put your

187
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.290
head with two

188
00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:53.730
phd students.

189
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.230
-- Okay. Whoever they A R
-- E, should we be nice and give them three windows.

190
00:07:57.239 --> 00:07:57.600
Um,

191
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.200
yeah, may, maybe the other one would be more convenient if we a re

192
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.190
all working on the SA ME project.

193
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.589
So

194
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.579
we're close by.

195
00:08:05.929 --> 00:08:06.500
Okay.

196
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.700
Ok.

197
00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:08.760
Oops,

198
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.549
Supply it. And

199
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.769
the two Marianne's

200
00:08:14.179 --> 00:08:15.839
that won't get confusing.

201
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:20.609
Yeah, I'd like to have a view to the mountains, but,

202
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:20.880
well,

203
00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:22.049
it would

204
00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.739
be with Marian

205
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.359
and Janette.

206
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.369
It's alright.

207
00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:27.600
And we put Marian in front

208
00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:28.920
if you want to be

209
00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:31.320
where here. No,

210
00:08:31.559 --> 00:08:33.400
on the room and the opposite. Oh, here.

211
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.520
Oh no, that's a old town view.

212
00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.679
-- Well,
-- that's, that would have to be here or the other three person room.

213
00:08:41.828 --> 00:08:42.438
Yeah. Well,

214
00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:44.698
yeah,

215
00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:44.929
all

216
00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:46.859
times as well as well.

217
00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:48.638
Yeah, that's alright.

218
00:08:49.908 --> 00:08:54.859
-- She's not that far if she's li like in this one
-- here. And that's good because there a re

219
00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:55.848
Marian

220
00:08:56.268 --> 00:08:58.278
and Nicholas they a re on the other side of the.

221
00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.369
So it's, yeah.

222
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.409
Ok. So Marianne and who do you want to work with,

223
00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:09.030
who's left? Um

224
00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:11.559
Let me see,

225
00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:11.929
Martin.

226
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.630
No,

227
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:13.650
pier

228
00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:14.380
is done.

229
00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:15.840
Andre

230
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.260
Yalina

231
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.539
and

232
00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:18.799
Agnes

233
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.179
would be good

234
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:20.530
and

235
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:20.789
actually

236
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.020
is working for the

237
00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:23.700
Sa Me project as well.

238
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:24.989
Okay. So put

239
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.299
Yalina with um

240
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.750
with a beautiful laughter.

241
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.789
Ok.

242
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.020
And we have

243
00:09:36.979 --> 00:09:37.200
right

244
00:09:38.739 --> 00:09:39.479
No.

245
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.710
Do you think it's a good idea to put Martin and

246
00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:48.950
Andre together since they're working on the Sa Me project?

247
00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:50.270
-- Yeah, that
-- could work.

248
00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:52.179
And

249
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.820
Martin is just, uh, 50% in.

250
00:09:56.859 --> 00:09:57.280
Yeah.

251
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.080
And we might put Martin

252
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.789
and Andre and someone else in the three person room

253
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.440
since it's a 50%. It's a good,

254
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:07.640
yeah.

255
00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:08.619
Ok.

256
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.340
I guess I can go in there because

257
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.700
Martin and I are working on sort of the same thing

258
00:10:24.929 --> 00:10:26.419
and that leaves

259
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.669
Maria and Nancy.

260
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.190
Yeah, that's

261
00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:37.250
a weird combination.

262
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.119
Why?

263
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.299
-- So, what do we think about that? Okay. W
-- why don't we move Maria to this,

264
00:10:52.309 --> 00:10:53.010
to where,

265
00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:56.010
to the office? I'm supposed to be and I can go with Nancy.

266
00:10:57.539 --> 00:11:01.440
No, it's not that it's just, you've almost got a project split

267
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.229
except that you

268
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.789
don't because

269
00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:10.469
Nancy and Maggie and I work on

270
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:13.880
the Parmenides

271
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.150
and then

272
00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:19.010
Andre Martin, Maria and I also work on, I am too.

273
00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:22.559
And so does Susan.

274
00:11:23.479 --> 00:11:24.580
Although the Susan

275
00:11:25.929 --> 00:11:27.169
is not a good thing,

276
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.789
this project splitting, I mean,

277
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.330
no

278
00:11:31.679 --> 00:11:32.989
splitting by project,

279
00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:37.869
-- but then we should split the little, mm DS LT party
-- up.

280
00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.580
Yeah. No. But if you, I, if you split by project you put me in one

281
00:11:42.979 --> 00:11:43.789
person room

282
00:11:45.109 --> 00:11:45.280
all

283
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.299
on your own.

284
00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:55.000
Hm.

285
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.359
That's hard.

286
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.239
I would put it the other way.

287
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.500
I would put the room with Martin in it in the two window room because he's 50%.

288
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.520
So then at least

289
00:12:20.729 --> 00:12:21.989
the other two people get,

290
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.419
could you say that again?

291
00:12:25.099 --> 00:12:29.570
Put Martin in the three person room with two windows

292
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.510
since he's 50%?

293
00:12:34.539 --> 00:12:35.520
So, you just,

294
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.590
you just move him or

295
00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:41.010
the two groups,

296
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:41.859
you just

297
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.799
either way.

298
00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:44.599
Well, I don't know if we're splitting up,

299
00:12:46.299 --> 00:12:49.239
what is this about windows or is it about it?

300
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.840
It, it must be functional if you and Martin work on the SA Me project then?

301
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.200
Yeah, I mean, uh, with whom,

302
00:12:56.309 --> 00:12:59.840
with whom you'd like to work in the Sa Me office? I mean,

303
00:13:00.169 --> 00:13:04.200
is it important to have someone, uh, from the SA Me project or? Um,

304
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.640
-- I don't
-- think it's necessarily so important to be in the Sa Me office with someone.

305
00:13:09.299 --> 00:13:12.270
-- If you're working on the Sa Me project,
-- we can Skype each other.

306
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:12.510
Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:13.989
But you

308
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.469
all to

309
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.059
get

310
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:18.000
and

311
00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:20.780
all the people by skyping all the time.

312
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.090
I don't know, like, right now I share an office with Bruno.

313
00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:25.770
We don't work on any projects

314
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:26.760
together

315
00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:27.479
except

316
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:28.630
coffee time and

317
00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:29.909
that's important

318
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.349
project

319
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.210
-- and stuff like that. That's
-- fine.

320
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.090
Like, I don't need to be in the same office as someone who works on IM two or

321
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.659
someone who works on par.

322
00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:45.320
-- It's not like, and it's
-- quite funny to, to, to hear

323
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.710
other

324
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.010
activities around you

325
00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:51.909
-- and not always the SA ME stuff.
-- Yeah, that's for sure.

326
00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:55.030
Especially when it's activity that you don't

327
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.260
understand or

328
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.789
you hear things out of context. Yeah. Right.

329
00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:01.580
I agree. But the set up is pretty good now.

330
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.919
So Bruno is not on MS LT and he's sharing, um, MS LT office.

331
00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.130
Uh, I'm not sharing somebody with,

332
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.239
I work on the Sa Me project.

333
00:14:11.239 --> 00:14:11.729
Um,

334
00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:12.099
yeah,

335
00:14:12.289 --> 00:14:12.299
I,

336
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:13.059
yeah,

337
00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:16.789
I don't know. You a re saying that, uh, Maria and Nancy

338
00:14:17.219 --> 00:14:18.390
doesn't fit.

339
00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:18.909
I just

340
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.539
-- together
-- in the SA Me, you can't really see them sharing an office.

341
00:14:21.659 --> 00:14:24.429
-- So, what you say
-- if you change the office, uh,

342
00:14:25.229 --> 00:14:25.890
I don't know.

343
00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:29.119
And do you work with Nancy or, uh,

344
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.960
what do you

345
00:14:34.539 --> 00:14:38.250
put Andre and Nancy Nancy together because they're starting that new

346
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.520
project?

347
00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:40.929
Oh,

348
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.270
yeah,

349
00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:42.710
for exa MP.

350
00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:44.340
And then put Maria with

351
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.799
me and Martin.

352
00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:46.000
I

353
00:14:47.059 --> 00:14:49.500
-- could see that working a bit better. Yeah.
-- Okay. Why not

354
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.429
would you, um,

355
00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.090
hm.

356
00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:00.309
What,

357
00:15:00.419 --> 00:15:00.530
you know,

358
00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:04.989
don't,

359
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.320
I'm not totally convinced.

360
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.500
Sorry,

361
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.210
I'm not convinced about what's

362
00:15:22.609 --> 00:15:23.000
bothering

363
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.460
you.

364
00:15:23.789 --> 00:15:24.239
I don't know.

365
00:15:31.049 --> 00:15:32.109
Yeah. What is it? Now?

366
00:15:33.419 --> 00:15:36.030
I thought you were saying you didn't wanna be in a three person room.

367
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:37.400
First

368
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:37.669
of

369
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:38.059
all,

370
00:15:39.469 --> 00:15:40.679
you're changing your mind. All this

371
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.070
from the beginning.

372
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.020
I said the three person room, it's quite, I mean, it's a disadvantage

373
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.830
but if you work with the people, like,

374
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:49.479
and

375
00:15:50.059 --> 00:15:50.119
Marian

376
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.770
and, um,

377
00:15:56.049 --> 00:16:00.309
to change a little bit this disadvantage, we put somebody 50% in a

378
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.109
3% room so we could do the SA me

379
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.780
in the 3% rooms.

380
00:16:05.059 --> 00:16:05.270
But there

381
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:05.429
is,

382
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:06.270
and he

383
00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:07.780
does have the window problem,

384
00:16:07.909 --> 00:16:09.630
which is why I still think we should put

385
00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:11.299
Gisela in that room because

386
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.080
it's,

387
00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:16.140
she gets the window, the Stasia,

388
00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:18.679
whatever he's there for two months,

389
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.140
-- it's their
-- problem.

390
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:20.780
And

391
00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:21.099
Stasia

392
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.390
it's here for working

393
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:24.960
for enjoying the beer.

394
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:25.969
Exactly.

395
00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:29.000
Well, anyway, it's always

396
00:16:29.179 --> 00:16:31.030
fucking Geneva. So there is no view

397
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:33.909
this having quite

398
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.039
a

399
00:16:34.919 --> 00:16:35.239
un avant

400
00:16:35.979 --> 00:16:37.789
situation because there a re Marian

401
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.039
and Bruno who a re

402
00:16:40.219 --> 00:16:42.330
having reception hours.

403
00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:42.849
But

404
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.789
that's so if you can

405
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.890
as well, we all have.

406
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.739
Yeah. So it's quite a

407
00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:50.799
traffic there. I would say.

408
00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:52.280
So what if we

409
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.299
switch?

410
00:16:54.719 --> 00:16:55.140
No,

411
00:16:56.179 --> 00:16:57.989
w will there be wireless in the building?

412
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.210
I mean,

413
00:16:58.219 --> 00:17:00.200
if there a re reception hours so somebody could

414
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.750
move to the reading room and have people,

415
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.500
-- you
-- have to have a computer with wireless.

416
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.170
Well, isn't this the case? Doesn't everybody have

417
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.219
-- one?
-- Well, most of us, first of all have desktop computers.

418
00:17:15.979 --> 00:17:19.989
-- Plus
-- you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours.

419
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.969
Right? Like people are actually using it as a reading,

420
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.030
having

421
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:25.189
a

422
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:25.810
room

423
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:27.079
room for

424
00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:27.920
reading or

425
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.300
so, what

426
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.500
can we say? We're gonna move

427
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.219
Gisela here?

428
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.430
Yeah.

429
00:17:34.609 --> 00:17:35.219
Okay.

430
00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:36.099
And then

431
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.880
I think that gives usa little bit more flexibility to play with

432
00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:43.209
-- moving people
-- around. Can we say that David

433
00:17:43.589 --> 00:17:44.439
goes here

434
00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:46.000
instead of

435
00:17:47.219 --> 00:17:50.300
you were the first one on the list? But if you wanna remove someone else?

436
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.550
No, because I was thinking of we can

437
00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:53.439
um,

438
00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:57.400
having these two office, which a re near to the lift.

439
00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.209
Keep this office for

440
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.359
reception people.

441
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.459
We a re pierre

442
00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:10.750
the two Marian and Iare receiving and Maggie and Susan,

443
00:18:11.219 --> 00:18:12.680
a re receiving a lot of students

444
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:14.890
with,

445
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.650
with the finish for exa MP if you want.

446
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.160
Well, you,

447
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.920
well, you have

448
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.949
already speak quite well finished. So.

449
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.319
Yeah. Yeah.

450
00:18:24.479 --> 00:18:24.540
Yeah.

451
00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:25.160
Okay.

452
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.780
Yes, I will.

453
00:18:30.689 --> 00:18:31.579
I'm just putting it in

454
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:31.719
it,

455
00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:36.550
-- but
-- that's nice to have a corner, a student, I mean, a student area.

456
00:18:37.939 --> 00:18:38.800
You know what I mean?

457
00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:40.319
-- Yeah. It's easy
-- for them to,

458
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.119
yeah, to find us. And it's also quite noisy when you have

459
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.560
this kind of

460
00:18:46.829 --> 00:18:48.170
parade of student

461
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.390
before the exa MS.

462
00:18:49.959 --> 00:18:52.589
So, if you work with me and you have this,

463
00:18:58.989 --> 00:18:59.449
so, Nico

464
00:18:59.689 --> 00:18:59.839
and Allina

465
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.510
-- or do you want to go somewhere else? I have
-- no problem with that.

466
00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:07.510
Um,

467
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.079
so in the photography is still

468
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:13.040
here.

469
00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:16.260
Yeah, we have to prune or run from the other side of the,

470
00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:17.989
but, well,

471
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.290
you just don't photocopy.

472
00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:22.920
Yeah. Who does anyway?

473
00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:26.260
Yeah. The people having students.

474
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:27.170
Yeah.

475
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.880
So maybe you and Bruno should take this office.

476
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.209
No, but it's too far from,

477
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:36.650
well, you have the other.

478
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:37.790
Yeah.

479
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.369
Left.

480
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.630
Ok.

481
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.949
Yeah. If we change the switch,

482
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.660
three people, Marian

483
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.380
David.

484
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.510
David

485
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.479
with here, with here. And, uh,

486
00:19:56.219 --> 00:19:56.719
oh, yeah.

487
00:19:57.619 --> 00:19:58.630
Yeah. That's a good idea.

488
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.439
-- That's like that.
-- And then

489
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.599
you too.

490
00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.660
So we have a three windows

491
00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:10.199
with you everywhere.

492
00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:14.040
That's what the plan was

493
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.540
from the

494
00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:14.930
beginning.

495
00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:17.869
You get the photocopying noise.

496
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.150
Now we're all gonna come photocopy just to annoy you.

497
00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:20.579
It's

498
00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:21.660
-- not
-- very healthy there.

499
00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:21.890
Yeah.

500
00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:23.650
And

501
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.430
bathrooms a re nearby. Yeah.

502
00:20:26.229 --> 00:20:27.050
Yeah. And

503
00:20:30.719 --> 00:20:31.339
OK,

504
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.709
I think that's quite nice.

505
00:20:39.959 --> 00:20:40.709
Or did

506
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.489
was the

507
00:20:43.819 --> 00:20:45.989
I should start start making full sentences.

508
00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:47.650
What about

509
00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:51.260
I was thinking about

510
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:52.560
moving Pierrette

511
00:20:52.699 --> 00:20:57.270
and Marianne into a two person office rather than a three person office.

512
00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.579
And then, and

513
00:20:58.959 --> 00:20:59.170
put

514
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.369
David

515
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.660
with Andre and Nancy for exa m

516
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.050
in a two person office. No, a three person office.

517
00:21:06.199 --> 00:21:06.890
And why?

518
00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:09.130
Because if they have

519
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.489
reception,

520
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.420
I know, I thought you were saying that

521
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:14.400
you

522
00:21:14.579 --> 00:21:16.439
should have a smaller office

523
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.609
or be in a smaller office because of reception or something or did I just completely

524
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.359
misunderstand?

525
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.869
No, no. The reason to put

526
00:21:26.239 --> 00:21:27.500
Pierrette and Marianne

527
00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:31.790
and to put Marian and I together is because of the noise

528
00:21:32.209 --> 00:21:33.280
we make by

529
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.060
receiving student.

530
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.560
And then the reason to put David in this office, it's because

531
00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:40.910
it's 50%

532
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:41.900
industry.

533
00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:42.459
Okay

534
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.680
place office.

535
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.250
Um,

536
00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:58.290
that sounds nice. No.

537
00:21:58.599 --> 00:21:59.609
-- Yeah,
-- it looks good.

538
00:22:00.989 --> 00:22:01.530
Mhm.

539
00:22:04.959 --> 00:22:08.989
-- And I think we do have the best office.
-- Yeah, I think too. I'm quite happy

540
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:09.079
to kind

541
00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.699
of dictatorship.

542
00:22:12.939 --> 00:22:14.719
We a re here to make a decision. So,

543
00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.319
and Agnes, you're gonna sell this to

544
00:22:19.619 --> 00:22:20.760
the administrator.

545
00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.199
Yeah, I'm going to try. Yes.

546
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:23.729
Yeah.

547
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.439
So,

548
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.290
ok, what arguments do I need?

549
00:22:29.359 --> 00:22:31.160
-- Well, we have the,
-- the argument of

550
00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:32.000
the group and

551
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.030
students here,

552
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.079
although you still have Susan and Maggie over here.

553
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.619
Yeah.

554
00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:40.219
-- Yeah.
-- But it's quite logical to have the, for the professors.

555
00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.160
Yeah. One person rooms,

556
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.239
I, I think.

557
00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.459
Mm.

558
00:22:58.609 --> 00:23:01.579
So it is sort of a, well, no, it's not a project split.

559
00:23:02.849 --> 00:23:05.270
It's weird because it kind of, isn't, it kind of, isn't

560
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.180
because Maria Martin and I all work on the SA ME project

561
00:23:11.109 --> 00:23:13.579
and then Andre and Nancy work on the SA ME project.

562
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.099
-- Yeah. But
-- we all work on different projects so we can't.

563
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.800
But it is a little squared you put,

564
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.920
oh, it's a printer

565
00:23:25.109 --> 00:23:25.890
and the photography.

566
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.599
Okay.

567
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.439
That's quite fine.

568
00:23:39.849 --> 00:23:42.520
Okay. Let me just write down the arguments for why.

569
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.560
Um

570
00:23:44.449 --> 00:23:45.099
reception. One

571
00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.229
suggestion. If possible, we could move me and Yalena

572
00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:50.709
to the office where Andre and Nancy A re now

573
00:23:51.089 --> 00:23:52.510
you just want a bigger window.

574
00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:53.949
No, I, I just,

575
00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:56.599
it's just more convenient if I'm closer with my,

576
00:23:58.089 --> 00:24:00.540
you the partners on my project. Okay.

577
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.560
We can Skype, as you said.

578
00:24:10.089 --> 00:24:11.869
No. Yeah, that's fine. Happy.

579
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.250
So

580
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:19.630
the arguments a re

581
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.030
uh student reception

582
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.930
in one corner.

583
00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:39.170
So that's noise reduction.

584
00:24:41.209 --> 00:24:42.420
The 50%

585
00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:44.050
stuff,

586
00:24:45.189 --> 00:24:46.319
industry

587
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.530
person rooms.

588
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.869
Okay. And the projects they, they a re quite well grouped actually. Now,

589
00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:05.260
now they a re Yeah.

590
00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:05.699
Yeah.

591
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.979
And um

592
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.300
-- except for David, but we can't do anything about
-- that.

593
00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:13.000
And the two professor is one single

594
00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:19.719
and while Jesus

595
00:25:20.229 --> 00:25:21.500
is kind of

596
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:23.729
in the middle,

597
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.290
yeah.

598
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:26.819
Is the heart of the

599
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:27.469
heart

600
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.089
of the,

601
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.119
and since you n you will meet the administrator.

602
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.729
Can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere

603
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.000
-- in the reading room? That would be
-- good.

604
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.260
Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, there's no

605
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:42.500
coffee

606
00:25:42.719 --> 00:25:42.770
machine.

607
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:45.020
It's,

608
00:25:45.209 --> 00:25:46.030
you mean like

609
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.859
-- a little machine
-- or a vending

610
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.369
a vending machine?

611
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.170
The little machine I think would be harder to sell but

612
00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:55.709
ask

613
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:56.380
for,

614
00:25:57.099 --> 00:25:57.939
have a try

615
00:25:59.219 --> 00:26:00.199
the good coffee

616
00:26:01.189 --> 00:26:02.380
with good coffee.

617
00:26:02.949 --> 00:26:04.380
Italian one, please.

618
00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:07.869
Strong, strong, good coffee.

619
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:09.209
Yeah.

620
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.869
And hope

621
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.420
t

622
00:26:14.209 --> 00:26:14.239
good

623
00:26:14.369 --> 00:26:14.849
afternoon.

624
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.780
What did you say? Hot tea,

625
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.619
tea

626
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:19.739
for

627
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.160
the afternoon? Yeah, because with strong coffee, I don't sleep

628
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.579
if you're late. Uh, if you work late. Yeah.

629
00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.170
-- And you drink, uh, coffee.
-- Yeah.

630
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.949
And do we know if there will be air conditioning?

631
00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:42.410
Is there actually a smoking area somewhere?

632
00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.560
-- No, not
-- for

633
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.579
-- non smoking
-- building.

634
00:26:45.829 --> 00:26:47.189
Yeah, but we, okay.

635
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.089
We have the terrace still

636
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.599
on the

637
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.260
floor.

638
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.339
There

639
00:26:51.479 --> 00:26:51.500
is

640
00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:51.640
no

641
00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:52.859
terrace on that building.

642
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:53.260
No,

643
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:53.890
no, no,

644
00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:56.479
-- they'll have to go
-- down. They have to go down. Yeah.

645
00:26:57.819 --> 00:27:00.989
So, no, we're not gonna change the plane only for the smoke.

646
00:27:01.489 --> 00:27:04.890
-- Well, it's,
-- it's ideal for Nancy. She's just very close to the lifts

647
00:27:05.609 --> 00:27:05.670
and

648
00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:06.390
Susan and Maggie,

649
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:13.900
I think it's fine.

650
00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:16.050
Ok.

651
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.040
Excellent. Yeah.

652
00:27:27.699 --> 00:27:28.719
Yeah, I think it's okay.

653
00:27:29.099 --> 00:27:30.150
-- Let's see
-- what the

654
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:30.689
is

655
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.079
gonna help you with that.

656
00:27:34.239 --> 00:27:34.250
Uh

657
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.979
Yeah, I think so.

658
00:27:39.589 --> 00:27:42.160
Just checking if they actually have everyone but I think we do.

659
00:27:43.199 --> 00:27:45.099
So when exactly a re we supposed to move

660
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.390
in,

661
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.459
what was it? What did I say?

662
00:27:48.589 --> 00:27:48.719
Three

663
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.349
weeks,

664
00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:49.829
three

665
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:50.319
weeks.

666
00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:54.260
So, they've set up everything wiring, uh,

667
00:27:55.229 --> 00:27:56.069
internet

668
00:27:56.229 --> 00:27:57.099
or what's the step?

669
00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:57.560
As

670
00:27:57.849 --> 00:27:58.060
far as I

671
00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:58.420
know?

672
00:27:58.569 --> 00:27:58.750
Yeah.

673
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.000
As far as I know, basically we pack up one day, the movers come take all our stuff,

674
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.449
put it into the right boxes.

675
00:28:04.739 --> 00:28:08.770
So, when you get there the next day, all your stuff is already in your office

676
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:13.550
and all the IP S and everything is set up. They're trying.

677
00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.089
So

678
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.520
we'll see, make sure you label your boxes properly.

679
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.300
Um, especially the mer

680
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:22.979
hands.

681
00:28:26.199 --> 00:28:27.250
Yeah, they don't confuse it

682
00:28:27.859 --> 00:28:28.770
with the other Marian. But

683
00:28:29.229 --> 00:28:31.770
-- can
-- we think of putting a white board somewhere

684
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.880
in the hole for general information?

685
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:35.510
Uh,

686
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.800
we can try,

687
00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:38.670
I can ask though.

688
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.989
Well, ma mailing lists,

689
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.079
of course you can mail

690
00:28:46.219 --> 00:28:46.469
em.

691
00:28:46.709 --> 00:28:47.089
Yeah.

692
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.849
Yeah. But I mean, you have a nice poster of the next conference. You don't put

693
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.040
it

694
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:53.959
a

695
00:28:54.619 --> 00:28:55.979
b, a big board with,

696
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.390
um, where,

697
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.449
like along

698
00:29:02.569 --> 00:29:03.410
along one of the

699
00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:03.780
walls

700
00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:08.979
or in front of a reading room or?

701
00:29:10.329 --> 00:29:10.689
Yeah.

702
00:29:11.369 --> 00:29:12.739
Well, there a re, lots of walls

703
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:14.839
we can po posters on.

704
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.050
Okay. So,

705
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.410
along that bottom hallway somewhere.

706
00:29:30.479 --> 00:29:31.170
Ok.

707
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.829
Anything else I need to ask them?

708
00:29:40.439 --> 00:29:40.770
No,

709
00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:43.209
no more special.

710
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:45.339
Who is this?

711
00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.380
And I don't,

712
00:29:51.209 --> 00:29:53.579
actually we may need to sort out.

713
00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:56.459
Mhm.

714
00:29:57.709 --> 00:29:58.660
That's not healthy.

715
00:29:59.719 --> 00:30:01.380
Um, who,

716
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.280
I don't know if we need to sort out who sits where,

717
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.000
because if they're going to plug everything

718
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.500
and set everything up.

719
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.670
-- I
-- think it's,

720
00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:13.040
everybody's responsibility to find

721
00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:18.250
if they prefer to be in front of, back to a window or whatever.

722
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:19.339
I mean,

723
00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:21.959
if we start doing that and then not happy

724
00:30:22.219 --> 00:30:22.420
we

725
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:23.410
don't want

726
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:23.609
to.

727
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:25.030
So I

728
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.250
think

729
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:25.400
we

730
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.609
can,

731
00:30:27.439 --> 00:30:30.790
yeah, I, I just can't remember whether they're actually gonna set everything up

732
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.979
for us or not, but we can change it, I guess.

733
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.239
Ok.

734
00:30:38.729 --> 00:30:39.280
Ok.

735
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.319
That's it. Then

736
00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.599
I'll save this.

737
00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:49.760
Can you mail a copy of that to everybody?

738
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.609
Not right now because I'm not connected to the internet.

739
00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:54.819
No,

740
00:30:57.619 --> 00:30:58.390
but I will.

741
00:30:59.280 --> 00:30:59.890
Ok.

742
00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:01.660
Ok.

743
00:31:02.109 --> 00:31:03.209
Good. We're done then.
