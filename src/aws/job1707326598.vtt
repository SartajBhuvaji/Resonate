Hello, everyone. Welcome to.

1
00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:12.670
It's becoming an annual, um, meet and greet Q and A session with uh,

2
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.729
the CV SD Health and Safety team.

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.158
My name is Jocelyn Boe.

4
00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.030
I'm one of the school nurses at Shelburne Community School

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.930
and the COVID coordinator for the Champagne Valley School district

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.159
and have some wonderful experts uh who

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.850
are joining us today. So they're going to introduce themselves.

8
00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.090
So I'm also going to chime in, I'm Bonnie Bets.

9
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:35.819
I'm the Director of Digital Learning and Communication for the district.

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.509
So I'm mostly here to record this meeting and help make sure that others can see it.

11
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.909
Uh Lisa and Emily, why don't you all

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.110
go next and then we'll have our

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.099
position.

-- And I'm Emily mclean. I am a teacher at CBU High
-- School

18
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.180
CV U.

19
00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:06.690
Sorry. Ch

20
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.410
I had a lot of kids go through CV U

21
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.110
I, I think I told you once before.

22
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.389
I have like hundreds of hours of years, whatever it is.

23
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.559
So I'm Bill Ras, I'm a pediatric infectious disease physician at

24
00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.169
the University of Ramada.

25
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.379
I live in Charlotte and uh have vast experience with the school system there and

26
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.019
I'm really supportive of everything you do.

27
00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:28.339
It's good to see some familiar faces actually.

28
00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:32.059
Um um It's nice to be a part of a team. Thanks for inviting me.

29
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.459
My name is Doctor Elizabeth Hunt and I also live

30
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.669
in Charlotte and have three kids at CCS and I

31
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.110
help out in the volunteer capacity as the health advisor

32
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.239
with the school nurse there and the wonderful leadership team.

33
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.089
And I'm a general pediatrician

34
00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:52.989
in South Burlington, Vermont and joined by one of my partners.

35
00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:55.800
I'm Leah Costello.

36
00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:58.419
I'm a pediatrician at Timberland Pediatrics with

37
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.150
Elizabeth Hunt and I live in Heinsberg.

38
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.750
I have two Children that attend Heinsberg community

39
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.599
school and I have one child that attends

40
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.029
Annette. Um, she's two

41
00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:10.598
the daycare right across from CD U.

42
00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.759
Um I was wondering maybe, um before we jump into kind of our questions,

43
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.990
if one of our doctors wants to take a stab at just kind of setting

44
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.089
the stage of where we're at right now in the COVID landscape in Vermont.

45
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.139
And a lot of us left in June and thought we were leaving it behind for schools. And so

46
00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.740
I think it would be good for us to kind of get in that mindset.

47
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.139
Where, what are you seeing and what,

48
00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.740
what do you think we're walking into for the school year?

49
00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:41.130
So if I can, I'd love to take a crack at that. I think that

50
00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
there has been tremendous concern across the United States about

51
00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:49.559
the surge in infections and the transmissibility of the Delta variant

52
00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:54.929
that has really changed our thinking about the virus quite a bit nationally.

53
00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.039
I think that we've learned that this uh uh variant is much more

54
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.979
infectious than previous variants and that people

55
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.220
who are not vaccinated or not immune

56
00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.259
um will become infected.

57
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.990
And that we're seeing, that's one of the reasons we're seeing the surge in cases.

58
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.100
We're not entirely sure that the Delta variant is more,

59
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.860
at least to more severe disease.

60
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.429
We just know that it is much more infectious.

61
00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:22.059
Having said that I would say that Vermont is still

62
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.830
the safest place in the state.

63
00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:27.720
No, the nation to be, we are in good shape compared to everyone else.

64
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.690
If you look at our numbers compared to Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Florida,

65
00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:36.490
Tennessee, we are off the charts better, to be honest with you, we really are,

66
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.529
we get really excited when there are 100 cases and we have a 3% infectivity rate on

67
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.020
people who are testing and they're symptomatic. Um States would

68
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.100
love those kind of numbers.

69
00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.389
So we do want to reassure families.

70
00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:55.169
We really want to assure the nurses, we want the special educators that we,

71
00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:59.089
that we can send kids to school, that kids can be in school,

72
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.949
that kids need to be in school.

73
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.380
Um That this is a good safe environment where we

74
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.139
can do lots of things to keep them there.

75
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:07.750
So I don't want people to panic.

76
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.449
I don't want people to think that it's too dangerous to send their kids to

77
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.279
school or that they have to mask at home or something else like that.

78
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.320
We're just saying that with the Delta variant,

79
00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.380
you should just be more cautious about congre and endure,

80
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.959
particularly with people you don't know.

81
00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.790
Uh And, and in school settings,

82
00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:24.559
we've been very supportive of masking in the school setting.

83
00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:28.019
And I know, you know, the agency of education guidelines about that.

84
00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.079
But again, there, there's a a rationale for doing that.

85
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.709
So we want to reassure parents,

86
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.970
we want to reassure them that kids need to be in school, they can be in school safely.

87
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.630
We wanna reassure that the vaccines are safe and that at any opportunity we

88
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.799
should get shots in arms and we want to support them in their decisions.

89
00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:50.600
I'd like to piggyback on that question. Thank you, Doctor Rasco. That was great. But

90
00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:54.589
we also left in June feeling like we were just

91
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.109
not seeing a whole lot of illness last year.

92
00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:59.109
And as a general pediatrician in

93
00:04:59.329 --> 00:05:00.619
private practice,

94
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.070
we have seen a significant amount of

95
00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:07.269
infections that we don't typically see in the summer.

96
00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.829
Um So we are just the landscape is very different. We're seeing RSV and young

97
00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:15.040
infants and probably in older kids too. Um

98
00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:18.529
We're seeing kids with croup. We're starting to see hand foot and mouth.

99
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.200
We're seeing enter virus. We're just seeing some

100
00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.489
common summer viruses and some uncommon summer viruses.

101
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.760
So that's all in this picture with COVID that last year, we

102
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.440
saw very little pediatric disease um because of masking

103
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.239
and distancing and all the things that we did.

104
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.869
But we are now seeing those come back and that is

105
00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.459
just changing the landscape,

106
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.260
um and um changing the amount of quarantine and testing

107
00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:46.100
and the things that families need to do that,

108
00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:47.459
-- I hope we'll talk about
-- tonight.

109
00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:51.980
We also entered this school year now knowing a lot

110
00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:56.559
about vaccines against COVID that protect against SARS COVID.

111
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.140
Two

112
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.260
health care providers started getting vaccinated last fall, mid fall, late fall.

113
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.779
And our, you know, CV U students in 12 and up started in May.

114
00:06:08.049 --> 00:06:09.339
And um

115
00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:13.459
we know that it's a very well tolerated vaccine

116
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.019
that it does work vaccinated. Individuals are less likely

117
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:25.440
to get severely ill or hospitalized or have um death. And um in

118
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.869
the young, I mean, the percent of adverse effects is super, super, super low.

119
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.470
And over time, we've seen many

120
00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:37.269
vaccinated students, teachers and parents do very, very well.

121
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.809
Um So that provides

122
00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.130
an additional layer of confidence going into the

123
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.790
uh the school year.

124
00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:46.850
And we know like what Doctor Costello was saying

125
00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:48.820
about the virus is being funkier this year.

126
00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:52.690
It's largely because of masking, being so effective. And I would say

127
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.980
we talked a lot about masking

128
00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:57.790
and concerns about that for the student population,

129
00:06:57.799 --> 00:07:00.809
for you educators and think of how well they did this year.

130
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.230
They knocked it out of the park. The students were so flexible.

131
00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:06.829
Oh, we have this tea, you know, oh, it's gonna be like that.

132
00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:09.820
I was really, really impressed and empowered by

133
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.109
young people this year. And I think that's a, it's a better place to start from.

134
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.019
I can kind of piggybacking on that about masking.

135
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:20.670
I know that the Vermont chapter of the A

136
00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:24.190
AP is really encouraging universal masking in schools.

137
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.980
And um

138
00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:28.739
again, this is kind of a nationally a hot button topic about, you know,

139
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.700
wearing a mask in school and mask mandates.

140
00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:32.940
Can you guys talk a little bit about

141
00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:37.059
your position on masks in school and, and, and what you're seeing.

142
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.500
So uh the American Academy of Pediatrics and the

143
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.380
Centers for Disease Control uh did recommend universal masking.

144
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.380
The, we feel fairly strongly that masking really works to prevent transmission.

145
00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:57.299
We have great data in schools that when you follow mitigation procedures,

146
00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:59.200
we can prevent transmission in school.

147
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.640
Yeah, you know, there's a three part,

148
00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:03.489
you try not to get let the virus in you prevent transmission and

149
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.380
you get it out as quickly as you can with contact tracing.

150
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.059
But masking is a central part of that.

151
00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:16.920
The 80% rule has some uh background and, and in, in terms, in terms of um

152
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.100
what we call an R not value like how transmissible a virus is

153
00:08:21.109 --> 00:08:24.859
and how many people need to be protected before you have heard immunity.

154
00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:28.779
That number was really generated uh with the original

155
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.989
variants that were circulating in the United States.

156
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.010
We thought that if you really got to maybe 80%

157
00:08:34.229 --> 00:08:35.169
vaccination

158
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.510
that maybe you would have a herd immunity.

159
00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:40.278
What we're learning with the delta variant is that,

160
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:42.429
that may not be the best number any

161
00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:45.148
longer and that we're seeing more breakthrough cases

162
00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:47.838
uh though generally very mild. Um

163
00:08:48.138 --> 00:08:51.528
And so there is concern that that may not be a good enough there.

164
00:08:51.539 --> 00:08:53.879
And as you can imagine, Jocelyn operational

165
00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.570
an 80% rule uh is really challenging.

166
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.400
So, uh you know, at CCS, which is K through eight,

167
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.299
you know, you know, that's, that's a building as they just,

168
00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:10.559
just the 7th and 8th graders, are they gonna be allowed to unmask versus no one from,

169
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:15.039
you know, K six? Is it one building? Is it two classrooms

170
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.549
extraordinarily challenging?

171
00:09:16.559 --> 00:09:19.770
And if you can imagine, you know, that's more competent enough when you have K 38,

172
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.159
now you're at a school that straddles the New

173
00:09:22.169 --> 00:09:24.440
Hampshire border where you have people crossing the border.

174
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.219
How do you figure out whether 80% of the people have been immunized?

175
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.200
So, while we understand the rationale

176
00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:32.679
behind that,

177
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.929
I just think that that's gonna be really challenging and

178
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.020
I think that it is just so much more straightforward,

179
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.469
easy and appropriate to support universal masking in the school.

180
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:44.500
I would say that be

181
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.169
a Bell right now, I was supposed to join a different meeting at six,

182
00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:49.890
but Becca Bell is at a different school board meeting where

183
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.309
there are a whole bunch of anti maskers and anti vaccinators

184
00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:56.520
in the audience uh firebombing them right now.

185
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.530
Um Just because that's how controversial the issue is.

186
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.940
Well, in terms of tolerance of masking, I mean BSA,

187
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.630
I had mentioned that Children were accepting of

188
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.789
it and able to comply while still learning,

189
00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.549
socializing and

190
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.190
enjoying the school experience.

191
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.469
There were many parents um I think who are concerned about

192
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.409
the experience for their child.

193
00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:29.190
So maybe Cho chose for remote or we were reluctant to go to hybrid or in person.

194
00:10:29.609 --> 00:10:30.219
Um

195
00:10:30.419 --> 00:10:35.969
Also, I received a lot of con concerning kind of messages and questions

196
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.179
about athletics, temperature change, you know,

197
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.400
all of the environmental factors that

198
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:47.169
make wearing a surgical mask or a double layer, cloth mask

199
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:48.809
uncomfortable.

200
00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:53.229
I feel like the educational system handled that very well in terms of giving breaks

201
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.460
and letting kids know that if they needed to slow

202
00:10:56.469 --> 00:11:00.330
down or step away and take a break that they could

203
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.190
and we did not see any really dangerous or untoward

204
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.770
events in individual kids or the whole population this whole time

205
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.570
from masks.

206
00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:13.909
And that is once again a a valuable learning experience and

207
00:11:13.919 --> 00:11:15.530
I think kids will talk to each other about it.

208
00:11:15.539 --> 00:11:18.409
Yeah, it's not that bad. You can go to get air if you wear a mask.

209
00:11:18.419 --> 00:11:19.169
Um, you know, we're,

210
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.530
we're gonna end up masking a lot more when we have less ventilation,

211
00:11:22.539 --> 00:11:24.340
less opportunity to be outdoors.

212
00:11:24.349 --> 00:11:25.489
I suspect. So,

213
00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:26.770
um,

214
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:33.880
I think using the experience to support, um, people who might be antimaskers.

215
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.450
I hadn't heard that term yet. Bill. But, uh,

216
00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:38.219
so,

217
00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:44.080
um, the kids really are the best teachers I find in this, this kind of situation

218
00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.880
in addition to masking.

219
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.780
Can you think about some other mitigation strategies

220
00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:52.750
that you want parents to know about?

221
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.299
You want staff to know about?

222
00:11:54.309 --> 00:11:58.330
What are some other things that you saw that we were successful from last year that

223
00:11:58.659 --> 00:12:00.159
we need to carry over in

224
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.250
this coming year?

225
00:12:03.109 --> 00:12:03.119
I

226
00:12:03.299 --> 00:12:05.539
was, we have to keep sick kids home.

227
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.690
Um, and this is really challenging, um, for myself included as a parent. Uh,

228
00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:11.359
that

229
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.979
as if your child wakes up with the sniffles, it is not allergies, stay home,

230
00:12:16.989 --> 00:12:18.030
get tested,

231
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:18.820
um,

232
00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:23.989
reach out to your pediatrician or if your child has mild symptom symptoms

233
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.250
that you don't feel like you need to contact with your doctor.

234
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.059
You can actually just go to the health department sites and test. Um,

235
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.739
it's easy, it's available for kids over 12 months of age.

236
00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.659
Um,

237
00:12:35.109 --> 00:12:36.580
we went to the Waterbury one the other day.

238
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.080
It was amazingly smooth and easy, um,

239
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.440
for a close contact in our family and tested the whole family.

240
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.099
But, um, but we have to stay home if we're sick,

241
00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:49.090
that's hands down the most important thing and get tested.

242
00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:53.570
So, we're not bringing COVID into the schools. It is extraordinarily disruptive.

243
00:12:53.679 --> 00:12:56.650
Um, if any of you watching this are employers,

244
00:12:56.659 --> 00:12:59.169
you need to know that your employees who are parents

245
00:12:59.179 --> 00:13:02.099
are gonna need to take more sick time this year.

246
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.179
Um, and need to be more attentive to their kids and stay home.

247
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.179
Um This year because of not being able to

248
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.140
be at school or daycare with any sick symptoms.

249
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.099
Yeah,

250
00:13:16.109 --> 00:13:21.320
you hit it spot on and the algorithm that came out is um and

251
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.580
it seems like doctor Esky wrote in that there will be a little bit more

252
00:13:25.419 --> 00:13:27.320
fine tuning but um

253
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.570
just contact your medical home, your school nurse like ah what's this all about?

254
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.489
What should we do? You know, it's all about getting through this

255
00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:38.809
beginning together

256
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.549
and asking questions. We have good algorithms.

257
00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:47.729
The pop up sites are fine to sign up for free for symptomatic and asymptomatic.

258
00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:51.169
Many medical homes are testing, we do them in the parking lot

259
00:13:52.179 --> 00:13:56.859
like in our sleep practically. And the algorithms are really helpful.

260
00:13:56.869 --> 00:14:00.669
Like we've seen some young kids with teething runny noses

261
00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:02.960
like we don't necessarily test them and they're fine,

262
00:14:02.969 --> 00:14:05.210
you know, but most kids who have

263
00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.400
the symptoms that fall in the

264
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:13.150
the algorithm without being in close contact fever, shortness of breath,

265
00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:14.880
loss of taste or smell.

266
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.359
Um

267
00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:17.900
difficulty breathing,

268
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.340
cough,

269
00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:24.460
aches, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, those are still, you know, need to be in the,

270
00:14:24.469 --> 00:14:25.359
in the forefront.

271
00:14:25.369 --> 00:14:28.750
And many employers you, you know, had the COVID sick days and,

272
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.580
and I think

273
00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:34.380
parents are very understanding if the c a child's

274
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.150
teacher needs to be out because they're not.

275
00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:38.580
Well, I would hope they would, you know,

276
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:41.780
continue to support those kind of staffing changes that

277
00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:43.820
a school will have to make on the fly

278
00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:46.059
to keep kids safe. So

279
00:14:46.229 --> 00:14:49.619
staying home when you're sick is extremely important,

280
00:14:50.919 --> 00:14:56.200
Jocelyn, the only thing I would add is the immunization strategy remains critical.

281
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.869
We need to continue to emphasize immunization

282
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.159
and I think there's been a glow somewhat

283
00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:05.650
of a go slow movement for Children 5 to 12 or 5 to 11.

284
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.460
Uh I can go into that more detail, but I'm hoping that

285
00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:11.739
we can once, if that does get eau that we can

286
00:15:12.174 --> 00:15:16.405
not only school based clinics but pop up sites and as well as

287
00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:20.614
the medical home to maximize our opportunities to get vaccines into Children,

288
00:15:20.914 --> 00:15:22.825
to encourage the older Children to get

289
00:15:22.835 --> 00:15:24.825
their vaccine as well because they're eligible

290
00:15:24.974 --> 00:15:27.505
within the school. I think that there'll be contact tracing.

291
00:15:27.515 --> 00:15:29.945
The state of Vermont is still committed to contact tracing

292
00:15:29.955 --> 00:15:32.724
that's not gonna disappear although other states have abandoned that.

293
00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:34.265
Um And so the EpiPen

294
00:15:34.544 --> 00:15:35.565
is ready for that.

295
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.719
I think that ventilation remain an issue,

296
00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:40.770
but we're not gonna tell you to redo the hava

297
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.809
uh fans don't work.

298
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.719
But again, if use the summer,

299
00:15:44.729 --> 00:15:48.039
uh the warm weather to open the windows or keep kids outside,

300
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.400
I think an issue that comes up is what to

301
00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:54.359
do when you're um what to do during dining experiences.

302
00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:58.700
And so we continue to recommend that and that if

303
00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.659
you're unmasked and dining that you should try to separate.

304
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.359
But the only time we are talking about any distancing, you know,

305
00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:07.000
so the Agency of Education

306
00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:10.440
uh two pager did not talk about distancing at all.

307
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.799
But we tend to recommend from our point of view that

308
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.030
if you're unmasked, you should try to be separate for each other.

309
00:16:17.039 --> 00:16:19.719
We're cautious about putting an exact number there,

310
00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:24.179
Emily and others because me of the school foundered on 6 ft versus 3 ft.

311
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.039
But we just say as best you can, it would be nice if you could maintain 3 ft of distance.

312
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.940
And it may be that you have some kids in the classroom

313
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.239
and some kids in the cafeteria eating or something like that.

314
00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.619
But things like plexi class are gonna disappear

315
00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:39.530
except at the entrance to the the school where the

316
00:16:39.539 --> 00:16:42.239
person checking people and may have that as a barrier.

317
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:48.700
So just to follow up on that, Doctor Raza, um I think school lunchtime is,

318
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.520
is a big concern for us who are teachers.

319
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.739
Um So maybe we could spend a little bit more

320
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.630
time talking about that because as you already stated,

321
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.520
the A OE guidance was really spartan.

322
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.289
I mean, last year we got a big packet and it had pages and pages with lots of details.

323
00:17:03.299 --> 00:17:03.809
And then

324
00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:07.380
this year it was a quick little two pager that just said wear a mask and

325
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.780
I don't know, it sounds like maybe some new information is coming out from the A OE.

326
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.089
But what our doctors thinking is the best advice for health and safety measures

327
00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:20.209
when it comes to times during the school day where we have to unmask,

328
00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:21.380
-- which would
-- be eating.

329
00:17:22.439 --> 00:17:26.199
So my perspective on this is that when you're unmasked,

330
00:17:26.469 --> 00:17:30.660
you should try to indoors, you should try to separate as best you can.

331
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.540
I'm not worried about Children or adults being unmasked outdoors.

332
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.780
So if you're running around playing soccer

333
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.880
outdoors or playing tag outside and that's,

334
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.400
that's fine.

335
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.829
I'm not worried about that at all

336
00:17:41.069 --> 00:17:43.189
and, and, and then, but,

337
00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:45.420
but my recommendation is as best you

338
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.140
can to ensure distancing when they're unmasked.

339
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.069
The other things that the, the, the letter was silent but was, you know, are,

340
00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:54.939
uh artistic endeavors such as playing music,

341
00:17:55.099 --> 00:17:57.150
uh, instruments and singing

342
00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:59.719
and, and I don't know what will happen to that.

343
00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:04.099
Um But nonetheless, those are some pressure points on the school system at

344
00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:04.949
this time.

345
00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:08.869
But the biggest issue that I run across is, is just how, how do we eat together?

346
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.060
I think we will rely on our community to be vaccinated.

347
00:18:16.069 --> 00:18:21.739
We rely on our community to not send their kids to school with any sick symptoms.

348
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.650
And then we

349
00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:26.020
do our best to try to separate, um,

350
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:30.020
and knowing that we have those two other things in place that

351
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.619
vaccinations and

352
00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:35.290
nobody ill in school to help protect both the students

353
00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.569
and the staff in the school during those times,

354
00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:38.219
like eating.

355
00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:43.729
And does that, um, change if you have a mostly vaccinated population,

356
00:18:43.739 --> 00:18:45.420
which we would have at the high school,

357
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.430
unlike at least a school where you have a mix of unvaccinated and vaccinated.

358
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.130
Well, in theory, if your school has met the 80% criteria,

359
00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:57.609
then people don't have to wear a mask and

360
00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:00.170
you wouldn't do any mitigation strategies while dining.

361
00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:06.160
So that's why I'm very careful to say if you are in a masked environment

362
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.050
and then you unmask then as best you can usually distance.

363
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.170
So I'm thinking generally speaking in the Children, 5 to 11,

364
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.709
the elementary school age Children,

365
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.670
the general recommendation is to mask at all times and so

366
00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:20.290
done

367
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.869
eating lunch or snacks,

368
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.260
whatever is the pressure point in high schools where they have achieved 80%

369
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.859
it's

370
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.160
not gonna be an issue

371
00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:30.150
and people will mask if they want to, it'll be up to

372
00:19:30.579 --> 00:19:31.670
individual decisions

373
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.010
just for some context.

374
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:43.849
Our our 5 to 11 year olds usually eat their lunch in under 10 minutes, I would say. So,

375
00:19:43.989 --> 00:19:45.270
you know, thinking about just some,

376
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.989
some strategies that we can employ is just kind of when you're

377
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.170
done and you're done and you're gonna chat with your neighbor.

378
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.569
You can put your mask back on.

379
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.000
I think the lunch time is actually 20 minutes.

380
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.709
Five of that is getting settled and cleaning up. So

381
00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:58.930
it's a, it is a pretty short time.

382
00:19:58.939 --> 00:20:00.790
But I think that there are some ways that we can

383
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.069
look at our system having kids eat in the cafeteria and,

384
00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.449
and cut down some risk.

385
00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:09.829
I think the one we did the original healthy restart, we had, um,

386
00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:13.979
some rules that we had to allot 25 minutes for lunch.

387
00:20:14.199 --> 00:20:17.479
I don't know whether it was a federal regulation or whatever, but you put, you know,

388
00:20:17.489 --> 00:20:20.900
there's always another layer of complexity here, but you're right,

389
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.579
they're not as fast as the seaview high school soccer team eating,

390
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.579
but they are pretty quick.

391
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:29.010
Um,

392
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.349
I was wondering if you can talk as professionals when you're thinking about how

393
00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:36.030
you talk to parents who are maybe are on the fence about that vaccination.

394
00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.199
Um I know that that still remains one of our best strategies for our group.

395
00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:46.349
Um So how do you kind of talk to parents who are skeptical about a new vaccine or,

396
00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:48.219
or are concerned about the,

397
00:20:49.199 --> 00:20:51.619
um, having their child get vaccinated?

398
00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.310
Well, I usually a, a

399
00:20:56.619 --> 00:21:02.550
lot of parents feel like it's really new for the 12 to 17 year olds. Um

400
00:21:03.369 --> 00:21:07.579
And while that cohort received the vaccine later,

401
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.819
the vaccine the base moderna and pfizer vaccines

402
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.869
for which young people are eligible depending on their age,

403
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.260
whether it's pfizer or Moderna

404
00:21:16.579 --> 00:21:22.579
um, have been around now for almost a year. And so we, we have had time

405
00:21:23.979 --> 00:21:29.439
in real life with our population to observe how well tolerated the vaccine has been.

406
00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:37.239
Um, I think adverse events in 12 to 17 is like 0.6% something like that, less than 1%

407
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.229
based on the research and the trials and

408
00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:44.000
in real life. Absolutely. It's, it's that low. Um

409
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.160
So I kind of say, well, it's the same one I got.

410
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.709
It's just, you know, and the same is true.

411
00:21:49.719 --> 00:21:54.599
It's the same substrate that they're working on dosing for the 5 to 11 year olds.

412
00:21:54.609 --> 00:21:58.760
Um, and that tends to give them pause, like, oh, kind of like

413
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.290
the measles vaccine you got is the same one your child got essentially. And um,

414
00:22:05.089 --> 00:22:09.829
so that talking point seems to help. And also, um

415
00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.739
we like, it's really, I think, helpful to understand that

416
00:22:14.969 --> 00:22:17.859
so much of the unknown when it comes to your child

417
00:22:17.869 --> 00:22:20.520
is about doubt and wanting to just erase all doubt.

418
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.699
And that's what good parents do. They, they do what's best for their kids and just

419
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.520
validate and listen and share that, you know,

420
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.140
they're being a great parent by thinking critically about this and that,

421
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.060
like Leah Castello had alluded to,

422
00:22:35.069 --> 00:22:39.770
it's good to be ready and really feel ready and our job is to help that readiness.

423
00:22:40.119 --> 00:22:44.270
Um And just say, well, you know, sometimes I ask, what are you worried about?

424
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.609
You know, they say, well, I read this Myocarditis article

425
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.449
and um

426
00:22:49.969 --> 00:22:50.780
we don't

427
00:22:51.089 --> 00:22:53.219
because this is happening in real time.

428
00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:58.329
There, there are things we don't know about the COVID vaccine moving through time,

429
00:22:58.339 --> 00:23:00.969
but the same is true of the CO COVID infection

430
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.989
in the young and long COVID.

431
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.880
We believe that the risk of COVID

432
00:23:07.709 --> 00:23:12.369
is, is worse than that far worse than that of the COVID vaccine.

433
00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:13.630
And

434
00:23:14.479 --> 00:23:15.099
um

435
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.800
people tend to respond to that. Um

436
00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:20.760
Also

437
00:23:21.109 --> 00:23:24.000
the fact that MRN A vaccines are not new.

438
00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.630
Um And that there weren't any shortcuts like the way I explained,

439
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.199
people really freak out when they realize how quickly this vaccine come out.

440
00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:32.189
And I explained that

441
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.050
the teams worked harder. They ran all the

442
00:23:37.239 --> 00:23:38.780
mai everything happened

443
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:44.810
as a priority day, night, weekends so that the timeline was abbreviated,

444
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:48.969
but there weren't scientific shortcuts that would put anyone at risk

445
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.449
and um

446
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.530
that is helpful. They just don't, they're like, oh really?

447
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.010
Oh, I thought they just skipped steps. Um

448
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.520
and then um

449
00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.400
a lot of teens want to get vaccinated but their parents are apprehensive.

450
00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.839
And so I have found that turning to the teen and saying, what do you think?

451
00:24:06.849 --> 00:24:09.660
What have you heard that a lot of them are just as well as formed,

452
00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:11.209
informed as I am and they're

453
00:24:11.569 --> 00:24:12.359
eager

454
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.939
and then I like to talk a little bit about what it gets us as a community.

455
00:24:16.949 --> 00:24:23.119
So being vaccinated is a commitment to one's neighbors. It's a commitment to

456
00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:24.530
prevention.

457
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.449
It's a commitment to those who are immunocompromised or cannot be vaccinated.

458
00:24:29.829 --> 00:24:31.160
And that

459
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.079
um

460
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:37.989
that as a community committing to vaccination is our way out of the

461
00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.140
dramatic

462
00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:42.099
um lifestyle,

463
00:24:42.109 --> 00:24:46.829
social and emotional changes that we've all been through for better or for worse.

464
00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:48.439
And Doctor Bell

465
00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:53.329
who's advocating right now wrote a great letter like a week and a half ago

466
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.670
that really highlighted the exacerbation of the pediatric mental health crisis.

467
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.250
And we deal just as much with that

468
00:25:01.689 --> 00:25:04.640
as we do with COVID concerns, if not more.

469
00:25:04.949 --> 00:25:07.050
And that has we have to roll that back.

470
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.680
You guys this,

471
00:25:07.689 --> 00:25:14.729
this school year as much as we can and um a regular routine being in person connecting

472
00:25:15.189 --> 00:25:16.599
with other humans,

473
00:25:17.089 --> 00:25:20.199
knowing there are resources, there are supports,

474
00:25:20.209 --> 00:25:23.439
there are other people out there who are just as concerned.

475
00:25:23.449 --> 00:25:26.250
There are great school nurses and teachers, I think

476
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.780
um

477
00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.689
will really help um with the start.

478
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.380
Sorry. That was kind of long.

479
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.219
-- I
-- would add one thing to that. Um

480
00:25:36.589 --> 00:25:37.969
Elizabeth, that was great. I

481
00:25:38.349 --> 00:25:41.890
uh long term side effects is another thing that parents bring up.

482
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.390
And I think we can really confidently say after

483
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.969
decades and decades of research around vaccines that we long

484
00:25:49.979 --> 00:25:53.560
term complications is not something that we see or have

485
00:25:53.569 --> 00:25:56.060
any concern from in the medical and scientific community,

486
00:25:56.069 --> 00:25:56.540
we see

487
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.920
um side effects in the first few,

488
00:25:59.239 --> 00:26:05.349
2 to 6 weeks after a vaccination. So the study was adequate to look for

489
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.670
any potential complications. But we don't see

490
00:26:08.979 --> 00:26:14.329
effects on puberty or fertility or there's just no scientific basis for that.

491
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.680
And sometimes even just really talking through why

492
00:26:16.689 --> 00:26:19.550
there is no scientific basis for it um

493
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.449
helps to parents to maybe not make a decision right there in the moment.

494
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:27.369
But just to think about it more critically and know that we're,

495
00:26:27.739 --> 00:26:31.349
that there are logical explanations that we can walk through.

496
00:26:38.609 --> 00:26:43.310
-- I'm not sure
-- if this is Jocelyn. Could you talk a little bit about um

497
00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:48.469
what kind of uh surveillance testing and things like that is gonna look like? And

498
00:26:48.719 --> 00:26:49.260
um

499
00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:50.989
so one of,

500
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.989
I would say another mitigation strategy that we are

501
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.839
going to have out of the gate is testing.

502
00:26:55.849 --> 00:26:57.589
And last year when we sat here,

503
00:26:57.599 --> 00:27:00.449
we talked about testing and it was that a great strategy.

504
00:27:00.459 --> 00:27:01.229
And at that point,

505
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:01.770
our, our

506
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.300
state's testing capacity um wasn't as robust as it is now,

507
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.819
but now we're in a much better place and

508
00:27:08.969 --> 00:27:14.189
we're going to partner with the A OE to offer surveillance testing for all students

509
00:27:14.469 --> 00:27:18.040
and staff on a regular basis. And I, I don't have a

510
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:21.369
firm under know, you know, plan of how often.

511
00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:25.000
But I'm, we did surveillance testing on staff last year every month.

512
00:27:25.209 --> 00:27:28.400
And so I imagine we will be doing the same thing.

513
00:27:28.729 --> 00:27:31.569
Um If parents are listening, it's going to be an opt

514
00:27:31.819 --> 00:27:32.219
in,

515
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.030
you would have to register your child. You'll get um,

516
00:27:36.209 --> 00:27:39.069
you know, a user name and password, you will register your child,

517
00:27:39.219 --> 00:27:44.800
you will get the results. It's not something that school will um have results for.

518
00:27:44.989 --> 00:27:49.540
But um your school nurses will, will be helping your child get good swab

519
00:27:49.709 --> 00:27:53.869
and get that sent out to the Broad Institute in, in Massachusetts. So,

520
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.790
um

521
00:27:54.949 --> 00:27:56.810
I think that will be one of our,

522
00:27:56.819 --> 00:28:00.300
our strategies as a school to catch those asymptomatic cases.

523
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.829
You know, we,

524
00:28:00.839 --> 00:28:02.770
we're hoping not to catch any asymptomatic cases

525
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.790
because we're hopefully those kids are staying home.

526
00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.030
But um

527
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.630
you know, that will help give us a little bit of

528
00:28:08.969 --> 00:28:09.500
um

529
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.420
insight into, into what we're seeing in,

530
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.989
in a population in schools and hopefully catch cases like Doctor Rasa said,

531
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.949
you know, before

532
00:28:17.219 --> 00:28:18.030
they go

533
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.630
-- and
-- spread

534
00:28:21.439 --> 00:28:25.979
and just a reminder that it is so easy to go to the health department sites,

535
00:28:25.989 --> 00:28:28.260
whether you're symptomatic or asymptomatic.

536
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.739
Um, you actually don't need an appointment.

537
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.859
Um You can register for an appointment but you can also wait.

538
00:28:34.239 --> 00:28:35.479
Um And they are

539
00:28:35.849 --> 00:28:39.089
so easy to go to both in Burlington,

540
00:28:39.349 --> 00:28:42.790
Winski, like I said, we went down to Waterbury, but they are all over.

541
00:28:42.949 --> 00:28:46.359
-- Um And another option for testing.
-- I've been tested so many times.

542
00:28:46.369 --> 00:28:47.890
I forget that other people haven't.

543
00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:53.160
And just so everyone knows it's not the big deep brain tickle that we all heard about.

544
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.454
Um, last year and everyone was a little fearful of.

545
00:28:55.464 --> 00:28:58.974
It's just a little swab inside your nose. It's not painful at all.

546
00:28:59.114 --> 00:29:03.824
Um, my own Children have done it so many times. They're practically experts. So,

547
00:29:03.944 --> 00:29:06.015
and kids can self swab too.

548
00:29:06.314 --> 00:29:10.604
Um, my six year old going into first grade did not want to the other day when we tested,

549
00:29:10.614 --> 00:29:12.814
but my nine year old did fine.

550
00:29:12.824 --> 00:29:13.395
Um

551
00:29:13.545 --> 00:29:15.494
They're walking into the room right now. In fact,

552
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.079
yeah, we self swab

553
00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:20.359
in our clinic.

554
00:29:20.599 --> 00:29:25.199
Um, like two year olds, three, I mean, they're actually, yeah, it works quite well.

555
00:29:25.209 --> 00:29:25.520
And

556
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.369
um glad to hear our infectious disease community supports

557
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.000
that because you can get a great sample.

558
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:35.020
You just say I need the mucus, like really get it wet, you know.

559
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:36.449
Um

560
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.380
And uh

561
00:29:38.449 --> 00:29:40.420
yeah, brings, brings them together.

562
00:29:40.579 --> 00:29:41.459
It'll work out.

563
00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.189
Jocelyn. This might be a question for you.

564
00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:50.750
Is the district still planning to keep the

565
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.670
-- COVID dashboard going to report out on
-- cases.

566
00:29:55.449 --> 00:29:55.920
Yes.

567
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:56.560
At this point,

568
00:29:56.569 --> 00:30:03.300
we are planning to keep um our weekly update that Bonnie and I do on the website.

569
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.880
Um or we report our cases that are infectious in school.

570
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:11.349
So if somebody isn't infectious in school, we don't necessarily know about that.

571
00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:12.880
And so we don't report that

572
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.430
people can also look at the department of Health website.

573
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:18.849
They update it twice a week, last school year I'm not sure their plan for this year.

574
00:30:18.859 --> 00:30:20.069
But if they want to see

575
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.979
um cases that are infectious in school,

576
00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:24.229
the department of Health reports on that as well.

577
00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:33.719
I

578
00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:38.079
don't know if this is something that you guys can speak to as, as uh you know,

579
00:30:38.089 --> 00:30:39.839
insiders on the V chip team.

580
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:42.880
But can you talk a little bit about the breakthrough cases?

581
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:47.339
I think um you know, our our staff is, is has robust vaccination rates,

582
00:30:47.349 --> 00:30:48.359
but there is some

583
00:30:48.589 --> 00:30:50.910
ambivalence of being parents of young

584
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.219
kids or living with immunocompromised people.

585
00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:54.880
Can you talk a little bit about,

586
00:30:55.319 --> 00:31:00.079
you know, the likelihood of a breakthrough case and a breakthrough case spreading?

587
00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:02.390
I know the governor talked about our

588
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.010
percentages on the press conference yesterday,

589
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.609
but I don't know if you had some

590
00:31:07.089 --> 00:31:07.209
even

591
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:07.800
data.

592
00:31:08.729 --> 00:31:10.650
So I think the take home message

593
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.849
has been and should be for a long time is

594
00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:17.989
that the vaccines work extremely well at preventing severe disease.

595
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.989
The vaccine strategy was designed to prevent severe disease.

596
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.569
It was a bonus that it prevented infection.

597
00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.449
I think people are a bit surprised at

598
00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:29.349
how effective the vaccines were preventing infection.

599
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:29.969
But

600
00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.619
from the get go and now they still prevent severe disease,

601
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:37.239
all three licensed vaccines in the United States.

602
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:40.290
What we're seeing though is that we're seeing a

603
00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.859
AAA fall in tighter over time

604
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.900
and a fall in protection against infection over time

605
00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:50.849
and that was shown in Israel would use the

606
00:31:50.859 --> 00:31:54.260
Pfizer vaccine almost exclusively and they were very aggressive.

607
00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:56.719
And there was just three reports today and then,

608
00:31:56.729 --> 00:32:00.520
mmwr which just shows that there is waning protection against infection

609
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.869
that the Vermont data has been reassuring, generally said it's uncommon.

610
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.410
Um There's some,

611
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.349
a little bit more concerning data that a

612
00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:10.670
couple of states are really monitoring very carefully,

613
00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.430
the breakthrough rates.

614
00:32:11.439 --> 00:32:13.699
It's and now it's taking up a slightly higher

615
00:32:13.709 --> 00:32:17.219
percentage of cases than an unvaccinated because historically,

616
00:32:17.229 --> 00:32:17.910
this has been,

617
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.260
this wave has been the wave of the unvaccinated.

618
00:32:21.369 --> 00:32:22.010
To be honest with you.

619
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.229
It's still primarily that,

620
00:32:23.239 --> 00:32:26.750
but we are seeing an uptick in people who have breakthrough cases.

621
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.949
They tend to be a bit older to be

622
00:32:28.229 --> 00:32:31.010
with you. They tend to have more immuno compromising conditions.

623
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.010
But no, unless it's there. And the, the rationale for actually,

624
00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:36.500
um the booster,

625
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.630
I would say that most people entering school are actually not

626
00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.939
in that high risk category that uh most of them,

627
00:32:41.949 --> 00:32:46.380
you know, that the teams weren't the eau wasn't even until March, you know,

628
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:47.449
um things like that.

629
00:32:47.459 --> 00:32:52.530
So III I do think that there is some breakthrough, but again, we're,

630
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.680
it's designed to prevent severe infections.

631
00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:57.599
We don't know quite how infectious people are with bright

632
00:32:57.609 --> 00:32:59.800
breakthrough infections because that's been hard to sort out.

633
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:04.319
We do know that they have relatively similar amounts of virus in their nose.

634
00:33:04.369 --> 00:33:08.800
Um as those people who uh have not been immunized and become infected,

635
00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.969
but we don't have great data on exactly how transmissible they are.

636
00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:18.500
And that's unfortunately just another

637
00:33:18.739 --> 00:33:19.979
wave of

638
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.290
how this has to be managed. You know, if you read the

639
00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.949
A OE two pager, it's about kind of managing COVID

640
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.829
and doing our best to prevent

641
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.270
serious outcomes and

642
00:33:34.829 --> 00:33:38.000
bolster vaccination and, um,

643
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.430
educate Children and

644
00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:43.150
keep them feeling safe and healthy. Um,

645
00:33:44.819 --> 00:33:46.959
it's not like a switch you can flip.

646
00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.199
We've seen,

647
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.670
um,

648
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:59.260
I think we've gotten through both of our questions for this, this group.

649
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:04.380
Um Do you have any like partying wisdom for us for the year or

650
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.729
words you want us to carry with us?

651
00:34:10.158 --> 00:34:13.638
School is really important um And can be safe.

652
00:34:13.648 --> 00:34:17.248
I think we did this last year really well. Um

653
00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:19.279
and really um

654
00:34:19.628 --> 00:34:22.759
led the nation in our vaccination efforts,

655
00:34:22.768 --> 00:34:26.268
led the nation in keeping our kids in school more than most

656
00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:29.688
of my friends across the country had their Children in school.

657
00:34:29.868 --> 00:34:32.618
Um What we've done for Vermont kids is remarkable

658
00:34:32.628 --> 00:34:34.759
and we really can continue to do that,

659
00:34:34.768 --> 00:34:36.739
but it's a community effort.

660
00:34:36.748 --> 00:34:39.938
Um All those who are eligible must get the vaccine.

661
00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.620
If your child is sick, please keep them home and get tested

662
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:51.280
and wear your mask when you're indoors. Um It's a much smaller set of steps this year.

663
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.800
Um

664
00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.280
And that we can get our kids really safely back in school.

665
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.620
Even I feel confident that your Children,

666
00:34:59.629 --> 00:35:02.729
if you're a teacher who happens to get a breakthrough case that

667
00:35:02.879 --> 00:35:03.729
school,

668
00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:06.439
you being in school teaching and your Children being in school

669
00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:11.280
is still just really the benefits far outweigh the risks.

670
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:11.870
Um

671
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.340
And that even though we're in an,

672
00:35:14.639 --> 00:35:19.540
we have a hot more transmissible variant, that does not mean 100% of kids get it.

673
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.169
If it comes into a classroom, that is not what it means.

674
00:35:22.179 --> 00:35:25.600
And with these small efforts, we can

675
00:35:26.219 --> 00:35:29.360
make that risk even much lower.

676
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.540
Um And I'm really excited for kids to go back to school

677
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:36.370
and see them in the classroom and see them doing more.

678
00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:39.520
I'm so excited for my daughter to go into the art room. She's never gone.

679
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.860
She's starting first grade and she's never been to the library or the art room and

680
00:35:43.370 --> 00:35:46.750
here we go. Um It'll be so exciting in music class.

681
00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:54.040
I would add to, please use us, please reach out to your medical home.

682
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.800
We really love working with the educational system

683
00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.459
and just being part of these awesome communities.

684
00:35:59.469 --> 00:35:59.929
And

685
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:02.510
there I get lots of questions. I'm happy to answer them.

686
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:06.620
You know, I have this vacation book to see the grandparent. What should I do? Should I

687
00:36:06.889 --> 00:36:08.510
refund or

688
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:13.439
you know, wanting to set up birthday parties and celebrate together and

689
00:36:13.649 --> 00:36:17.399
feel normal and we can talk about those situations.

690
00:36:17.409 --> 00:36:20.100
We try to have information at the ready

691
00:36:20.659 --> 00:36:24.020
the districts do online um

692
00:36:24.229 --> 00:36:28.300
American Academy of Pediatrics. Um And

693
00:36:29.129 --> 00:36:34.550
it's gonna change, you can count on anything it's change and, you know,

694
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.870
we're here to be a sounding board and help support

695
00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:40.179
and it's just 1 ft in front of the other.

696
00:36:40.189 --> 00:36:40.590
Really?

697
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:42.199
But

698
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:44.320
it's gonna be good. It's gonna be a good year.

699
00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:49.229
I just wanna say thank you for all that you do to get the kids into school

700
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:53.169
and keep them in school. I'm deeply appreciative and anything that

701
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.209
we can do to support you in that effort.

702
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:56.850
I'm happy to participate in.

703
00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.459
Well, it's been a pleasure seeing all of you

704
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.969
and, um, you know where to find me and any questions, happy to talk to you at any time.

705
00:37:12.169 --> 00:37:12.550
All right.
