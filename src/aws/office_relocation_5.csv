0,spk_0,0.00015,2.710166666666667,"I guess Ill start with my presentation. We had two groups of people working on this. So well show you two slightly different presentations. Feel free to ask any questions or comments. Obviously, um The first one was done by myself, Bruno Marianne and Nikos. And the rationale that we have, Ill show you the layout in a second was that full professors would get private offices. Administration is close to the professors offices. So its easier for the secretary to speak to everyone. The fax is in the administration office since its mostly used by Gisela, whos the secretary for noise reduction purposes. Weve moved everyone who has office hours together and weve also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall. Um So Ill just show you how that works. Basically, you can see Gisella sort of there in the middle with the fax machine. And Maggie and Susan, who a re the two full professors and our department have the private offices and the photocopier and the printer, a re sort of in the hall on the side there across from the mailboxes. Um Just to go back, most people a re grouped in projects and we have 2 50% people who a re half time in Geneva, half time A T, the Epflin Lausanne and they, then weve put in three person offices so that in the three person offices, its not constantly three people. So theres a little bit of give there and the reading room or the lounge as some people call it that we have is in a central position. So basically, weve got Andre and Nancy A T the top. Um, they dont act, they will be starting a new project together if, um, if Im not mistaken, like I said, Susan and Maggie in the individual offices, Nikos and Yalina who work on the SA me project A T the bottom, the reading room is in the middle. Um Marianne and Bruno A reat the bottom. Um, as well. Marianne works closely with Pierre and the other Marianne. We have two Marianne in our department and David is a half time. So as I said, the half times are in the three person offices. And on the other side, we have Maria Martin and myself who all work on the same project and Martin is 50%. Um Gisela, weve given her a two person office for two reasons. One is because theres a spare place there. So if we want to put a tie or someone who just comes in for a short period of time, we figured it was okay if they were in the admin office, which is a little bit noisy because theyre only there for a short period of time. Um, and again, the proximity to the other offices. Um, so I guess thats pretty much it for our proposal. Um, I dont know if you want Andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me."
1,spk_1,2.720666666666667,2.8425,"So you said so Pierre is a professor, but shes only, shes only 50% time. Is that why"
2,spk_0,2.8704833333333335,2.9113166666666666,"its, do you wanna explain how"
3,spk_2,2.9261666666666666,2.96,Martin is? 50% Martin
4,spk_0,2.9625,3.054316666666667,"is 50% pure? Theres two sort of statutes  of professor, I guess you could say,
 well,"
5,spk_2,3.05665,3.16315,"because you would say that shes an assistant professor or something like that. But um yeah,"
6,spk_0,3.185,3.199,"and the,"
7,spk_2,3.2133333333333334,3.5813333333333333,"yeah, they a re full professors and assistant professors if you want. And yeah, its true that shes an assistant professor. But uh, well, we see maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh, well, also a t least, maybe not a uh an office alone but a t least with just one person, not two.  But the
 idea is Maggie and Susan, a re sort of the senior"
8,spk_0,3.5988166666666666,3.688483333333333,"um professors on staff. So they got the, the individual offices"
9,spk_1,3.74815,3.9558333333333335,"and what, whats happening, what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years? Like beyond this, beyond this current group of people, do we, do we know of any changes coming?  Is the department growing
 or"
10,spk_0,3.9598166666666668,4.947816666666666,"um, the department will obviously be growing. But theres some people who only work part time. Theres some people who are doing phd S or master students who wont necessarily be there for a larger extent of time. So for Exa M Yelena and the Finnish Marianne, a re master students for right now, so whether they decide to stay and do a phd, were not sure yet. Um Nikos is working um as a researcher. So for him, its the same thing. Theres, I think the only constant people are Susan, Maggie Andre, um Gisela Pet. Um And all the rest are either phd students or master students. And again, Martin and David are half time with the BFL. So thats project dependent as well. Unfortunately, we havent been given as much space as we would have liked, but thats always the case."
11,spk_1,5.008,5.127983333333333,"And have you, have you talked to any of these people to ask them if they have any special requirements?"
12,spk_0,5.1418333333333335,5.337,"Um, Susan wanted a private office. She has a preference for private offices. Other than that,  no one really had any tight constraints from what Ive
 heard of people."
13,spk_1,5.337166666666667,5.40715,They needed to be near or people they needed to avoid or
14,spk_0,5.4345,5.483816666666667,no ones explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else.
15,spk_1,5.5,5.564316666666667,"But youve given people a chance to say that if they really needed to. Okay, good."
16,spk_3,5.5745000000000005,5.700816666666666,"But even no specific views f or mountains or old town or, I mean, people prefer any windows."
17,spk_0,5.702833333333333,5.777666666666667,"No, and they were fine with it. And theyre both nice views."
18,spk_3,5.789483333333333,5.868483333333334,"I  guess those thin lines, a re, I mean, their windows or, yeah,
 their windows."
19,spk_0,5.89665,6.222816666666667,"Oh, sorry, the thick lines, a re windows actually we have fairly big windows. Yeah. Yeah. So theres lots of light coming in and one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in. So people just go somewhere to sort of relax and  have a quiet places. They have a lot of light. It says
 mountains. Is that because"
20,spk_1,6.23165,6.301816666666666,"thats the view.  So its the best of you. You gave the reading room the best of
 you."
21,spk_0,6.303983333333333,6.606416666666666,"Yeah. Well, I mean, it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral could sort of go both ways. But, yeah, weve got two mountain views, sort of on that side, that side. And then the last part looks on the old town because were on the sixth floor. You can actually see everything. I dont think buildings a re much higher than,  what was it? Six or eight
 floors."
22,spk_2,6.61425,6.620416666666666,Just
23,spk_1,6.630066666666667,6.669066666666667,"so,  whats a purple thing
 there?"
24,spk_0,6.6730833333333335,6.747416666666666,The purple thing is the mailboxes and those a re fixed. We cant do anything about those.
25,spk_3,6.850483333333333,6.969833333333334,"So you cant do any partitions. I mean, youre planning to do any partitions in three persons and rooms or these kind of block."
26,spk_0,6.9809833333333335,7.373316666666667,"We dont have anything like that. If we can get stuff like that, it might be a good idea. Some people might like them. A t the moment we have people thre sharing like three people in our room without any partitions and its a little bit noisy but people sort of get used to it. And admittedly its mostly assistants that a re stuck in rooms like that. So its junior people. But,"
27,spk_2,7.422,11.638833333333332,"um, well, I can think of some reactions from the people. So maybe I can.  Do
 you wanna do your presentation? Yeah. Well, tell me about some of the constraints and, well, first of all, I must say that there a re also quite a lot of common points. So, um, its probably not going to be very difficult to. Yeah, please. Thanks. Perfect. So, um, yeah, actually, we, um, well, basically the, the group who produced this, uh, proposal was made by Susan Martin David and, uh, and myself and we also, well, Susan volunteered to ask Maggie and Pierrette about how they, they felt about sharing offices. And, uh, so as you can see, well, um, Susan gets obviously the SA ME office, which is quite a good thing. Um, then things start to move a bit. It looks like Im also in the SA Me position. But the most obvious constraints that uh we, we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge, uh, just a lounge in one room because it would block us two full working places. And although its true that the group, I agree, decided to, to have to have a lounge. We propose to put the lounge, uh, in the room. A t the, the upper side on, on the right. Uh, so let two people share this with, uh, sort of, uh, yeah, a place where we have, uh, a sofa maybe and, uh, and some books. So its obviously a calm place. People a re not there to talk very loud, but they can sit and relax and still look a tat the mountains. Um Also, so thats one of the main differences. I think maybe one of the points that we have to talk about. Uh The other one is the admin office. So its written Gisella 50% because shes only half time and uh the fax machine, um Gisele actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh its true that her activity is quite noisy when she is there. Um Its also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the, the projects actually that we manage. So it appeared a t least to, well to our group that even if shes here only half time, she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to, to work in the, the Sa me office. Uh Gisela is has no objection against sharing the office. We thought it was more for the, the calm of the, the people its true that this blocks one of the one person rooms. But uh on the other hand, uh Maggie has no objection. Uh sharing an office with her assistant and this appeared to be true. Also, of Pierrette, we dont know about Pierrette, sharing an office with two persons, but a t least no problem in Pierrette sharing her office with uh Marian, the Swedish one who is her assistant. Um So this is why we, yeah, we put Maggie with, with Bruno and then the third main difference uh would be the, the number of visitor places or free places. Uh You notice a new na me in the room uh A t the centre, upper, upper side. So thats Paula. Its true that its someone coming next year. Susan reminded me this uh of this point and I could not really ignore it. Uh So, um this, she is in Italic. She will arrive in about two months and the two vis one and vis two A re the visitor places you had one I think called free space or spare, spare place. Um We didnt really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms. So the, the two A T the center uh where is there, Paula, Yalina, the two visitors and then Maria plus David. So I think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate. So not to have one empty room when we have no visitors. Um And uh then a very full room when everybody is here. So I think we were, we a re quite willing to split and put, say maybe one visitor with Maria and David, uh 50% in the other room with the second visitor. So that"
28,spk_0,11.644316666666667,11.7525,"realistically, we dont actually have that many visitors coming in. Ive been there for almost two years and weve had a couple of  stas, but thats
 it."
29,spk_2,11.754333333333333,12.700816666666666,"Well, yeah, exactly. So the visitors are basically stier and it happens that sometimes we have two of them, even if its only for three or four months, Martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor, for instance, we cannot really put him with Gisella because, well, they wouldnt feel very nice. They, they made the joke. Yeah. So we should manage some kind of decent space. Its true that these one or two last one or two years, we didnt have a visiting professor. But, um, yeah, so, uh I think, yeah, these a re the three main points. So one is the place of the lounge. Uh The other one is the uh the place of the admin office with Gisela. And the third one is the number of visitor visiting people. And uh, well, how many of them we want to accommodate? And where, where we put it, these, I think a re the three main differences. Otherwise we pretty much agree on, uh, on placing people."
30,spk_0,12.717166666666667,12.880666666666666,"Oh, in a way, if thats your argumentation, then put a visiting person with a senior researcher, at least if not a professor rather than two students."
31,spk_2,12.9065,12.943483333333333,"Um, sorry, I, I didnt understand"
32,spk_0,12.98015,13.128983333333334,"if youre gonna argue that the visitors a re supposed to be important and they should have their own space, then put them with another researcher rather than two students."
33,spk_2,13.1375,14.096483333333333,"Yeah, thats, thats true. I think, yeah, they a re quite open to, to this. Martin also reminded us that hes quite noisy. He has a lot of uh phone calls to make even if its here, if hes here only 50% of the time. Um So, yeah, I, I dont mind this but uh thats something but its true. Yeah, we could also try to put a visitor and the professor um Martin made another point. It was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their, well, in the presence of their phd students like saying, oh, I, I have to reduce her from 80% to 50%. Thats probably something. So, I mean, all these a re constraints, I dont know how, how you would like us to proceed from, from here or if you already have questions or reactions on this one,"
34,spk_3,14.123483333333333,14.287833333333333,"but how often the launch is used? Um People lose us  on a regular basis daily basis or
 fairly regularly."
35,spk_0,14.288,14.822166666666666,"Theres a t least one or two people in there. I mean, its, yeah, its a fairly new thing in the department, but its being used pretty regularly. It was something that a lot of people wanted. Just sort of a quiet space out of your office that doesnt have the office furniture, the office chairs, it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that where you can just go and relax and, or if you want to read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment  and because we do a lot of reading and things like that, it does get used fairly
 often."
36,spk_1,14.822333333333333,14.93615,"So its not a place for discussion and  we
 sort of have an open policy where if theres no"
37,spk_0,14.936316666666666,15.110316666666666,"one in there and you want to have a discussion, then thats fine. But you cant displace people who a rein their reading just because you want to have a mini meeting or whatever."
38,spk_1,15.117483333333332,15.295833333333333,"So theres no a re you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or how a re you gonna keep those things, keep them separate cause it seems like."
39,spk_2,15.324333333333334,15.654666666666667,"Mm Yeah, thats true. Thats one of the problems. Um Well, we were told that it was not really possible to build walls, but we noticed that this room actually has two doors. So uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of, well separation case or maybe just yeah, furniture or just uh some kind of screen,  but it wont
 be uh"
40,spk_1,15.6605,15.84365,"an acoustic separation. No, its not sound proof. So if, if the those a re students there, so if theyre noisy that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge, um"
41,spk_0,15.8585,16.075166666666668,"which is sort of why in our proposal, we had it completely as a separate room is that if you really want peace and quiet, you shut the door and when the doors a re shut, like, unless someones making noise right outside the door, it really is fairly quiet."
42,spk_1,16.11015,16.566483333333334,"But youve also put the lounge in a very k kind of a high traffic area where the mailboxes, a re the printer and the rest rooms. So thats, um, that may also that, that may be good for meeting people and bumping into people, but its maybe against the idea if its a very, supposed to be an isolated quiet spot. So, yeah. Well, it was actually this pressure from, from my group"
43,spk_2,16.56965,16.893166666666666,"that led to this to squeeze a little bit the, the place of the lounge. Now, how for instance, would the university feel about the room that would be only used as a lounge? Would they feel its too empty and that we have too much space or is there no problem. Do you see a problem with having a room just for a lounge or no?"
44,spk_1,16.91583333333333,17.0855,"Well, maybe if it, if it helps us pack more people into the offices because they have a private lounge. Maybe its a good thing, saves us money.  But,
 uh,"
45,spk_2,17.093633333333333,17.413333333333334,"so we could have a separate room as a lounge. As long as, uh, we pack the other offices. I guess thats personally, I, I have no problem with this. So, um, its, its fine. I mean, I suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have"
46,spk_0,17.422633333333334,17.615166666666667,"a lot of people, then you can get rid of the lounge, figure out what to do with the furniture, either distribute it between various offices or, but you  put it into storage
 somewhere."
47,spk_1,17.618316666666665,17.68515,So its not a completely experimental concept. Has a
48,spk_0,17.68865,17.820833333333333,"lounge. This is something that it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon, they just wanted somewhere to go off."
49,spk_3,17.821,18.017666666666667,"And  so you have some quiet
 time and thats where it came from there. A re bookshelves in there, but its not really a library because everyone"
50,spk_0,18.030166666666666,18.281833333333335,"a t the moment everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else. Its more really about having a comfortable place to sit, um, where its not an office environment, it doesnt look anything like an office."
51,spk_3,18.292333333333332,18.350666666666665,"You mean, you can display some new or new. Yeah."
52,spk_0,18.357983333333333,18.52215,And people can come in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or magazine lying around for other people. Weve got a bulletin board where you can paste up articles that you think a re interesting for other people. But
53,spk_2,18.544333333333334,18.94098333333333,"okay, so I think maybe we can agree on, on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to, to find space elsewhere. What about Gisela? How do you feel about putting her in a separate office? Which is the case now, I think she has,  which is
 why we were thinking that it wouldnt be a problem to keep her"
54,spk_0,18.94565,19.142666666666667,"with a spare person because thats the w the situation it is right now. And if youre a stas and youre coming in, you dont necessarily expect to have a full blown office if youre only there for about two months."
55,spk_2,19.146833333333333,19.25,"Yeah, it depends on what kind of visitor you a re exactly. So we could say some kind of low key visitor"
56,spk_3,19.30365,19.371983333333333,"even this 50%. I mean, theyre all separate or"
57,spk_2,19.37665,19.47415,"actually Gisela 50% means that shes there half time. Uh, generally in the mornings,"
58,spk_0,19.483666666666668,20.17481666666667,"Gisela has a fixed schedule for when shes there. But David and Martin a re sort of, they f it fluctuates like they cant say that theyll be there Monday, Tuesday and half of Wednesday and not the rest of the time, which is part of the problem. I mean, they cant specify when exactly theyll be there. So, our rationale for putting them in a three person rooms is that it doesnt matter when theyre there and whether theyre there for certain hours or not, its just either theres two or three people in those rooms and sometimes theres less, sometimes theres more because we also dont work fixed hours. Its not like we work, you know, 9 to 5 or whatever, everyone sort of keeps their own hours."
59,spk_1,20.185833333333335,20.270833333333332,"So, can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals? The key differences?"
60,spk_2,20.29515,20.446666666666665,"I think its what I tried to, to do before shared lounge, the shared  lounge, the
 assistance with their professors, two cases."
61,spk_3,20.457316666666667,20.486,And then do you have a separate?
62,spk_0,20.501,20.54315,We have P and Marianne in.
63,spk_2,20.548833333333334,20.674316666666666,"No, I think this is quite accepted in this case. No, I think its uh the lounge, uh the admin room, the lo the"
64,spk_1,20.683666666666667,20.752166666666668," admin room
 separate. Yeah, and the number of slots for visitor"
65,spk_2,20.755483333333334,21.109983333333332,"and for this new student who arrives because having just one spare place, this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group. People said uh we should have a t least two or three spare places just for, you know, growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive. So even if they a re not perfect places. Um"
66,spk_1,21.158666666666665,21.255166666666668,"ok. So you basically  achieve that by giving less space to the reading
 room, I think."
67,spk_2,21.2625,21.31598333333333,"Yeah, thats, yeah, thats how I did inin our proposal. Yeah,"
68,spk_1,21.373,21.70165,"I guess one of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group? Really? Is it, is it something thats a very valued thing that has to be protected, um, or is it okay to make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need, when you have some extra visitors and things like that. I think thats,"
69,spk_0,21.723666666666666,21.957,"I think because its a fairly new thing, its a little hard to say a t this point. I think that most people like it now that its there, they sort of see the value of it and they wouldnt want to see it wiped out entirely. Definitely."
70,spk_1,21.96848333333333,22.056833333333334,"But I suppose once it, if it gets eaten away a little bit, a tot some point it becomes unuseful. And then, yeah,"
71,spk_0,22.073833333333333,22.091833333333334,and thats the danger.
72,spk_2,22.12015,23.011483333333334,"But then we need to squeeze inin one of the three person rooms, some extra visitor space. And, uh, I, I think so if, if we want to keep the reading room, I, I think its possible like playing a little bit with the furniture. Um, so, yeah, I think another point here and I dont know how you, you feel about it is, well, the fact that Martin is said he would be quite noisy, 50% of the time, so many phone calls. So I wouldnt put him in that big office even if hes 50%. But hes still a professor here and we got him from EPFL. So that I, I think, I mean, if we need to reach a solution. Now, I, I wouldnt mind working from your plan and doing some changes or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes. Um, so, um,"
73,spk_0,23.013816666666667,23.067166666666665," okay, well, since this ones up, keep
 this one in. Okay. Yeah."
74,spk_2,23.069333333333333,23.310316666666665,"Depends how, how easy you can write in it easily. Okay. So lets keep the reading room. Uh, also I think P Janet and Martin should deserve a t least, I think offices with one person, not with two. Okay."
75,spk_3,23.325166666666668,23.44315,"Maybe. Can we combine both or like two person room PP and Martin. Yeah, Martin is 50%."
76,spk_2,23.452333333333332,23.9525,"We, we never ask them. It could be. But um because the other side they have, I think no real project in common. So I wonder what uh I think I would prefer and probably my group would prefer to see them with the respective assistance. And I think Pierrette plus Marianne is a very good combination. Why not switching them from? Yeah, that office. Yeah. Switch the whole group. Yeah, Marianne Swedish. And then,"
77,spk_1,23.996666666666666,24.0335,"so what does that mean? Swedish?  Um
 Theres"
78,spk_0,24.036166666666666,24.113333333333333,"two V one is Swedish, one is Finnish. So we just call them the Swedish and the Finnish."
79,spk_2,24.134333333333334,24.189316666666667,Both Fami na Mes start with ST A
80,spk_0,24.230316666666667,24.2465,"no, both start with s"
81,spk_1,24.264316666666666,24.304166666666667,"so just to  know who they a
 re okay."
82,spk_0,24.379166666666666,24.463983333333335,"Uh It was Bruno, right? Ok."
83,spk_2,24.47015,24.601316666666666,"Mhm. Now, lets do something with Martin too. Um,  but
 even you can create one more speed"
84,spk_3,24.60315,24.64515,place in the big three piece room in here.
85,spk_2,24.654333333333334,24.876483333333333,"Yeah, maybe we can write it. This one. David is 50% and visitor one sh, yeah, or spare. Or its fine. Mm.  Well, for
 Martin, if you didnt mind working with Martin,"
86,spk_0,24.87665,24.89666666666667,we can switch Nancy and Martin
87,spk_2,24.898333333333333,25.098983333333333,"here. I think thats closer to what they said. Oops. Well, because actually we have this project in common, you know, go lime too."
88,spk_0,25.121166666666667,25.188333333333333,"Oh, wrong keyboard. I heard of that."
89,spk_2,25.2635,25.377166666666668,"Um Yeah, I think its, and so could we,  um, so
 we can say that this is sort of for,"
90,spk_0,25.380483333333334,25.481833333333334,"but then again, you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room."
91,spk_2,25.49965,25.604333333333333,"Well, I think, yeah. Or Gisela. But I think there is no way to,  well, you can say
 that this one is for, lets say stas"
92,spk_0,25.613983333333334,25.621833333333335,or
93,spk_2,25.628983333333334,25.703316666666666,"intern, yeah, sort of second. Uh  um um
 Yeah,"
94,spk_3,25.707483333333332,25.85315,"but you, you can move administration to the single room like because shes only 50% working and, and she will,"
95,spk_2,25.884816666666666,25.97533333333333,"so you would put  in a one person room
 and give that room to some professor"
96,spk_3,25.9755,26.025333333333332,with the student or from professor with the visiting place or?
97,spk_2,26.0375,26.248333333333335,"Mhm. Yeah, we could, yeah, even put, we can move Maggie and Bruno. We couldnt put Maggie and Bruno together, Gisela"
98,spk_0,26.259483333333332,26.34915,and move the other spare place to the big room. But then theres not a lot of people in there.
99,spk_2,26.3875,26.631833333333333,"No, lets leave it like this for the moment. How do you feel because your office, well, three persons and youre all full time in there.  So, you, with Nancy and Maria, were
 not terribly noisy. I think itll be fine. Yeah. And you have per does in common with Nancy"
100,spk_0,26.651316666666666,26.804333333333332,"and I am too, in common with Maria and we work on slightly different schedules too because Maria and I tend to work earlier and Nancy tends to work later. So that shouldnt be a problem."
101,spk_2,26.8485,27.4025,"And do you think we could put a visitor with Nikos and Yalina? Because its, its also, its not very clear, you know, Yalina s that was said in our meeting, Yalina sm master thesis should be defended, you know, couple of months or something like that. So we dont really know what happens afterwards. So we could a t least think its sort of an open place or you could get that office for you and Nancy and put Nikos and, uh, Yalina with Maria and a visitor. What about that? When would you like to have a columnar spot?"
102,spk_0,27.446983333333332,27.525333333333332,"Um, so you want to do? Thats gonna backfire me."
103,spk_1,27.541833333333333,27.68,"So, when you, when you put four people in that office, does that mean youre planning on four desks? You need space for four desks and thats the problem"
104,spk_0,27.685316666666665,27.757483333333333,"if its possible. Yeah, you either get smaller desks because the ones that we have now wont fit."
105,spk_2,27.766666666666666,28.230316666666667,"Yeah. But a visitor actually, um, doesnt have that much paper. So, for instance, maybe they dont need, uh, well, uh, the place to put their files, you know, a small, uh, drawer, they just need a, a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath. And so you can fit that, but you cant put three desks in the two person rooms. Yeah, probably not. I think it wouldnt be, uh, Yelena. And we, we could think of a visitor too here."
106,spk_0,28.251316666666668,28.295483333333333,So I think its gonna be too much. And so
107,spk_2,28.33865,29.375833333333333,"there is also this Paola arriving um on the new project. So, you know, Susan insisted that uh we should be and its all, its also, its not very clear because Nikos and Yalina a re well, Nikos is um research student, Yalina will finish her master thesis. So its Yeah. OK. Yeah, Paola or like that or maybe B LA will be able to choose. Yeah, I think thats quite okay. Uh Do you know about any preference of Maggie being alone or with Bruno? I dont think she cares. Yeah. Um David mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance. I, I dont know if there is a strong constraint but I think were doing pretty well. You mean?  So
 maybe you should break the wall between the mens room and the womens not sure that what was"
108,spk_0,29.401816666666665,29.6405,"actually Bruno did mention that he didnt want to be in a room with a lot of people because he did that before and he didnt really like it. So maybe, I dont know. I can switch with him and we can put him and Nancy together. I dont mind. It doesnt really bother me."
109,spk_2,29.648666666666667,29.786,"Ok. Thats fine if you mentioned this to you. Quite nice. And, ok. Yeah, Im with Martin. Thats very balanced."
110,spk_0,29.825666666666667,29.896833333333333,"Well, the gender balancing, we have more women than men in our department anyways. So,"
111,spk_2,29.902166666666666,30.21015,"yeah, thats why. Okay if you dont mind me sharing the office with Martin, thats fine. Okay. Yeah, that looks good. So, with, and David. Yeah. So you have IM two in common. Thats nice. And heres 50%. So that means the office is not very crowded. Okay. The other one is a bit crowded but thats okay."
112,spk_0,30.210316666666667,30.25815,Do you see any constraints from the administrative side?
113,spk_3,30.31015,30.484333333333332,"But even like you can put polar in administrative, you already three people. It looks like small room compared to the other three"
114,spk_1,30.511333333333333,30.587666666666667,is your person to square meter ratio within the university norms.
115,spk_2,30.621,30.639833333333332,"Um, I, I think"
116,spk_1,30.675,31.01865,"we dont, we dont, I mean, we dont want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and, and, and everyone having their own office. If thats not what were having in the other places, we have to make sure that um, if for exa Mples, theres a spare reading room, like we were saying before, overall, your department has, doesnt have excessive space per person."
117,spk_2,31.046983333333333,32.250166666666665,"Well, what was said, Inin, my group actually, Susan, who knows professors from other, um, other faculties. Well, she noticed that most of them have rooms alone. So this is true for Susan and Maggie, but not true here for Pierrette and, and Martin. So we can already argue that uh were squeezing in even the, the professors. Its true that the reading room, but, you know, we fought so much to have it. So lets, uh lets try to have it there. And I think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we a re already quite uh quite full. So, um I think, yeah, its normally the nominal capacity of this. I think its uh 18 people, um 18 or, or 17 and were already 15 if you dont count Paola and some visitors place. And I think its quite important to have space for visitors because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new, well, intern during the summer, youre re very much handicapped. So I think were, yeah. Um Well, the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already. So I,  we tried
 to"
118,spk_0,32.25548333333333,32.342,"basically, were moving into a new space, but its only marginally better than the old one."
119,spk_2,32.36666666666667,32.49765,"Yeah. So I think, yeah, what we could say about the reading room is that we, we squeeze quite a lot of people inin the other offices. So I think its okay."
120,spk_1,32.53183333333333,32.649483333333336,"No, its good in case I ever have to defend it. You know, its good to have some numbers, if you can come up with some numbers."
121,spk_0,32.65866666666667,32.67281666666667,"Yeah, we can do that"
122,spk_1,32.67733333333334,32.94481666666667,"and maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments. Thats, its good to have that. But if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy, then um its fine with me. I dont know about you. What do you think?"
123,spk_0,32.967816666666664,32.969166666666666,So?
124,spk_2,33.065,33.31966666666667,"Maybe its another name, just say, OK, its fine. Okay. Okay. So my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to"
125,spk_0,33.32966666666667,33.406666666666666,everyone along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space.
126,spk_2,33.430483333333335,33.44915,"Ok?  Were
 done."
127,spk_0,33.457483333333336,33.461983333333336,Great.
128,spk_2,33.467166666666664,33.482483333333334," Thank you for your
 time. Thank"
129,spk_0,33.4855,33.486983333333335,you.
130,spk_2,33.49548333333333,33.516666666666666,"Thank you, sir."
131,spk_1,33.5425,33.60581666666667,Ok? And the hookers downstairs.
