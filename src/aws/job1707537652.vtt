WEBVTT

0
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.349
But you wanna be attentive.

1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.039
Uh Yeah, thank you.

2
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.699
Any specific position, I'll just sit your way up

3
00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:10.848
there.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.050
Well, Andre is just,

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.739
um,

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.959
I'll show some slides.

7
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.509
It's all very natural.

8
00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.580
Yeah,

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.959
it's

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.169
a bit

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.830
strange.

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.479
Yeah.

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.279
Yeah, I think it's

14
00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:45.439
-- no bad like
-- this

15
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.650
-- and don't forget
-- the,

16
00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:55.400
um,

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.450
so hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this meeting.

18
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:00.000
Um,

19
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.080
well, as you all know, the topic of this morning's meeting is, uh,

20
00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.379
the fact that we're moving and

21
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.489
we're going to get more space. So that's a very good piece of news.

22
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.559
Uh, but we also have to find out how we use this space.

23
00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.139
So, um, if you want, I'll

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.669
just give a brief overview of what's happening

25
00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:29.019
and then we can, uh, talk about well, arranging these new, uh, the new office space.

26
00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:31.059
So, um,

27
00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:34.529
in case you haven't seen the, the document,

28
00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:36.250
uh, let me just, uh,

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.379
show you very briefly

30
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.550
the, the configuration of the, the space.

31
00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:45.300
So, um,

32
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.500
well, there is nothing much to say.

33
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.040
Well, you know how many of usa reare present and you know that we a re, um,

34
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.819
a bit tight actually in our present location.

35
00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:59.379
Uh That's why actually, the university finally um

36
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.129
allocated us this uh this part of uh the uni

37
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.949
building. So it's a t the sixth floor

38
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.850
and it's a set of contiguous rooms as you, you can all see from uh from here.

39
00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:13.100
Um

40
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.360
So the, the, the one P, two P three P means the, the number of persons

41
00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.509
as you can see we have. So a corridor

42
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.630
um

43
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.850
with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person rooms, two person room and,

44
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.339
and three person rooms.

45
00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:38.220
Um Actually, I think Agnes did this nice drawing. So she even put the, the views.

46
00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:42.389
So we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the other two sides.

47
00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.570
Uh We have some bathrooms for us.

48
00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.229
Uh and the courtyard,

49
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.789
which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down a t the,

50
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.020
-- the first floor
-- and just uh just a clarification question, a re the

51
00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.229
number of people per room indicated strict or can we play around with?

52
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.320
I mean, if there a ree two people,

53
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.100
is it really that you can't put three or uh 2.5 or uh how,

54
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.589
how was it?

55
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.179
-- Well,
-- it's a bit difficult to say because um in fact,

56
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.699
we have some constraints in terms of furniture.

57
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.190
Uh they're here.

58
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.259
So, um well, your, your person, your,

59
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.309
your question actually is answered maybe by the third item.

60
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.779
So each person should get.

61
00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.779
Um Well, it's a sort of desk, it's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with,

62
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:29.929
of course, a chair,

63
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.460
uh, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk.

64
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.509
Uh, and, well, we can put hanging shelves over the, the desks.

65
00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:39.259
So

66
00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:46.690
I'm not really sure. It's possible to get 33 desks in a two person office. But, um,

67
00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.979
we could try

68
00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.509
what's, what should be said here. I don't know if, well,

69
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.759
you, I, I will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them,

70
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.699
maybe it's easier.

71
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.820
Do you need something, Martin?

72
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.619
We can keep this for you.

73
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.460
Uh So it's, it's, yeah, you have a copy, Susan, you to David. I think

74
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.119
so. In fact, there a re more places than people. So we won't be that constrained

75
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.070
uh as you know, some of us and some of you here actually Martin David a re part time.

76
00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.160
So it, it's for the moment, quite comfortable.

77
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.709
Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for, you know,

78
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.899
temporary people coming to work on uh on projects.

79
00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.429
Uh Yeah, I uh yeah, I counted so we have

80
00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:34.540
um 15

81
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.720
pers physical persons

82
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.480
and about uh 16, I think uh persons or actually 18 persons in the offices,

83
00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:46.359
counting the re the, the reading room.

84
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.519
Exactly. So one of the issues uh here, it's probably not on the slides

85
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.179
is that we would like to have uh unlike what we had until now a lounge or reading room.

86
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.149
Um, I, one of the, the offices. So in one of the rooms

87
00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.559
do we

88
00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.750
really

89
00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:02.239
need to?

90
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.000
Um,

91
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.309
I think quite a lot of people express the need for that.

92
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.160
So if we could do it, I think it would be much nicer.

93
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.260
-- Um, let me also, uh, s say something. Don't forget
-- the time we spend

94
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:17.709
to,

95
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.950
for discussions about that room to

96
00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.670
be able to authorize this if

97
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.950
possible.

98
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.149
Yeah, I I

99
00:05:24.359 --> 00:05:24.399
still

100
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.640
with

101
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.089
you that the the we a re not so we a re not so large as far as space is concerned uh because

102
00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:33.450
15 people to put in their 18

103
00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:34.730
positions.

104
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.529
So uh to the best uh if you take

105
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.809
uh two people room for the reading room, then you have

106
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.450
-- well, 1616
-- play slots for 15 people. So it still should be feasible.

107
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.399
That also means that the growth will be zero.

108
00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.040
Yeah, I think that's quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can

109
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.359
think of. Yeah, some two or three

110
00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.309
for

111
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:00.250
visiting people.

112
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.130
Mm-hmm.

113
00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:07.920
Okay. So let me finish with the the constraints which a re almost done.

114
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.100
So we also need to, to find a,

115
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.649
a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine and the printer, the fax you know,

116
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.859
is very small but

117
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.160
um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well this size

118
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:26.880
um okay, the offices come with white boards, not very uh very important.

119
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.890
Uh The furniture that each, each person has

120
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.500
and, uh, you have a list of people.

121
00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.029
So, the thing, uh, you,

122
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.019
you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that we a re think that,

123
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.450
that a re thinking about, uh, far, well, about putting people inin these rooms.

124
00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:48.929
Um, there is another group that is also having discussions.

125
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.459
So the idea is that today we'll just sort of start seeing the main constraints

126
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.480
and then

127
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.559
you have time to, to go and think about it.

128
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.250
Uh ask the people, you know, your assistants for instance,

129
00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.760
and A t the next meeting, we'll try to,

130
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.720
to come with one solution.

131
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.290
Uh The other group will also propose a

132
00:07:10.299 --> 00:07:12.920
solution and then there will be another negotiation.

133
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.019
-- So, and
-- if we don't get this space, then what happens?

134
00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:19.600
Uh if you, if we don't get these,

135
00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:24.059
um, well, basically they a re promised to us. So, uh

136
00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:28.339
do, do you think there a re chances that they take from us, one of the rooms or?

137
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:29.459
Uh

138
00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:30.410
okay.

139
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.649
Yeah. II, I think it's uh

140
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.779
no, the, the, the chance it might be that there a re more people to put in that space?

141
00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:37.130
Yeah.

142
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.799
Yeah, that's one of the,

143
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:41.890
the problems I think maybe we should take this into account and

144
00:07:41.899 --> 00:07:45.250
maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people,

145
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.929
one being temporary or, or part time.

146
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:48.880
Um

147
00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:51.130
ok. So

148
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:58.549
maybe we could try to, to see now what would be the main options, say the general uh

149
00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:02.589
well, arrangement options. Do you think that we should put

150
00:08:02.739 --> 00:08:03.989
people say

151
00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:09.679
according to projects, for instance, inin the table that um that we have,

152
00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:11.910
uh we also have the uh

153
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:15.109
uh the, the main projects on which the people a re working.

154
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.989
-- So how
-- Andre sorry for interrupting.

155
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.369
But uh one again, clarification question,

156
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.769
what is the real margin of maneuver that we have for these discussions?

157
00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:29.959
Because uh a t least we a re a half percent, 50% of from EPFL. And uh sometimes

158
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.799
you have meetings where the, the, the decision is already taken. So, uh

159
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.690
and uh you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things. So

160
00:08:39.109 --> 00:08:41.888
what, what will be the impact of what we will

161
00:08:42.249 --> 00:08:42.808
come out?

162
00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:43.558
-- Oh,
-- actually,

163
00:08:43.568 --> 00:08:48.619
what is fixed is the n the number of rooms this week cannot really change?

164
00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.549
I mean, a T least not us.

165
00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:54.258
It would be much more difficult to get another, another room for instance.

166
00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:59.789
But what is absolutely not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms?

167
00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:03.458
So basically, we a re all the permutations, a re possible. That

168
00:09:03.818 --> 00:09:07.088
-- other way of
-- asking the question, is there any other group already working on the,

169
00:09:07.098 --> 00:09:07.919
on the,

170
00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:11.940
how this should be uh should be allocated or a re we, the,

171
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.539
the one that is supposed to do the,

172
00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:14.840
the, the position?

173
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.960
Well,

174
00:09:15.969 --> 00:09:18.119
what we a re looking for is a solution that

175
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.500
suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy.

176
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:21.849
So,

177
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.460
uh the other group is, I,

178
00:09:23.469 --> 00:09:27.219
I don't think we have to see them as competitors but they a re just trying to,

179
00:09:27.229 --> 00:09:29.940
to find another local optimum or why,

180
00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:31.900
-- why
-- don't they have any representative here?

181
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.049
Yeah. Why didn't we have a meeting together and

182
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:35.799
then,

183
00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:38.070
uh, uh Andrea

184
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.510
and, and

185
00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:39.929
will discuss about it with

186
00:09:40.429 --> 00:09:40.440
a,

187
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.099
you a re, the rep representative of this group.

188
00:09:43.229 --> 00:09:43.580
Yeah.

189
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.969
Uh, we, yeah, I think that's, yeah, there is no real competition between the two,

190
00:09:47.979 --> 00:09:52.210
but we'll just try to find a t least two solutions and see how,

191
00:09:52.219 --> 00:09:55.330
how close they a re actually, it's, it's, I think,

192
00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:56.409
well, the,

193
00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.250
the people who, who decided this thought it was the best solution to,

194
00:10:00.719 --> 00:10:04.799
well, you know, find 22 kinds of opinions. Yeah.

195
00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:09.340
Well, we could have been eight sitting around here and, and talking but I think it's,

196
00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:10.369
it's more difficult.

197
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.200
-- Yeah.
-- But, you know, that, that's the standard thing.

198
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.840
It's suppose that somebody,

199
00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:18.799
for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we don't know about that.

200
00:10:18.809 --> 00:10:21.750
We'll put them, put her or him somewhere else,

201
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.440
then we will do plenty of work for nothing because we'll not have this constraint.

202
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.859
We aware of this constraint.

203
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.239
Exactly. I think so.

204
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.640
So today, the goal is not to, to find a solution today, but set some constraints

205
00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:34.460
and then

206
00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:38.640
go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences.

207
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.080
Obviously we won't be able to accommodate all the, the preferences,

208
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.429
-- but a t least we'll find the most, uh, the most important
-- ones.

209
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.590
Well, certainly we have to ask, uh,

210
00:10:48.099 --> 00:10:50.330
and, uh, and Maggie since they're not here

211
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.070
because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do. And so

212
00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:55.830
that's another consideration too.

213
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.349
Yeah, I think so. That's one of the things I think we know that they have students.

214
00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:03.349
We don't know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone

215
00:11:03.599 --> 00:11:04.469
or to,

216
00:11:04.479 --> 00:11:09.969
well to be with their assistant or even with another person working on the project.

217
00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:11.049
So

218
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.440
that would have been maybe another solution is to ask everyone to provide a,

219
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.760
an arrangement.

220
00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:20.260
But uh I think that's a bit uh a bit hard then to,

221
00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.309
to work out.

222
00:11:21.859 --> 00:11:27.349
Um So since all of you have a copy of the uh well of the drawing, I think

223
00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:28.890
for the next time,

224
00:11:29.599 --> 00:11:34.289
maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh na mes on it.

225
00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:37.219
But let us try to see today

226
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.929
whether we prefer to

227
00:11:39.039 --> 00:11:43.669
organise people say by projects or just professor and assistant.

228
00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:48.609
So what would be say first, your preferences since let's, let's start with us.

229
00:11:48.619 --> 00:11:49.520
Maybe today.

230
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:53.159
Um What do you think about it? Would you prefer to be alone?

231
00:11:53.169 --> 00:11:55.090
Would you prefer to be with your assistant?

232
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.210
You who a re part time? Do you think you can

233
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.460
come here on a very

234
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.409
well regular schedule or is it part time but variable during the week?

235
00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:08.119
Yeah. Uh, ok.

236
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.750
Uh, me personally, I would like to, to, to share the, the p,

237
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.630
the room with the assistants as

238
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.380
when you have problems of normal life. Like, uh,

239
00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.929
the printer doesn't work. I don't want to ask this to my supervisor.

240
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.419
So it's better to, to be with, uh, with an assistant to share the room.

241
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.000
Uh huh.

242
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.000
And since you're coming on, um, half time,

243
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.590
do you think you will be able to group your presence here?

244
00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:36.510
Say Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, or is it going to be m much more random?

245
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.200
I don't think it's a good idea to share a, to,

246
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.090
to

247
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.599
share the SA me desk.

248
00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:41.109
Okay.

249
00:12:41.419 --> 00:12:44.650
Uh, I still would like to have my drawers and these things.

250
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.979
Yeah, I think so too.

251
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:52.369
Um, so Martin you a re also, um, half time and, well, the third person is

252
00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:52.940
Gisela.

253
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.250
I think it's quite clear that

254
00:12:55.489 --> 00:12:57.539
each person should have their own

255
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.880
desk and

256
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.010
-- it's no, no way. We, we could put two persons a t the sa me
-- desk.

257
00:13:03.419 --> 00:13:06.280
WW, where part time is important is that it's no, no

258
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.840
low load on the room. So, for sure if you have a part time person that reduces the,

259
00:13:11.119 --> 00:13:13.869
the ranges of time where too many people a rin the room.

260
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.820
Yeah, I think

261
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.419
I

262
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.739
probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence

263
00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:21.570
here.

264
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.000
Um The uh,

265
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.320
the thing that fin my case has to be taken into

266
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.409
account is that I will have a lot of phone calls.

267
00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:32.020
So I'll be talking o over the phone all the time.

268
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.869
So that's not necessarily,

269
00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:37.239
well, it depends on, I, I have nothing against sharing a, a,

270
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.179
an office with somebody I already did it before.

271
00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.200
So, and it was perfectly fine.

272
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.109
It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody

273
00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:50.000
else is having phone calls in the in the room,

274
00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:55.280
which is very much dependent on people. Some people a re not disturbed a t all by this,

275
00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:57.010
some people just can't work

276
00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.150
a re you disturbed by the phone calls of other people. I'm not.

277
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.530
-- But
-- uh

278
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:08.710
and uh what might happen but it uh it will not be so heavy here, uh a tio as

279
00:14:09.099 --> 00:14:10.059
visitors

280
00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:16.299
so that I will have more a TEPFL uh typically students coming in or asking for things

281
00:14:16.849 --> 00:14:19.909
as I'm not teaching here. I'm teaching a TEPFL.

282
00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:21.929
This should, shouldn't be a such a big load.

283
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.679
So for me, it, it will be essentially, I will not be,

284
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:29.200
I will not be able to be silent in the room because I will be

285
00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:31.940
communicating also through vocal means. So

286
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.599
before um talking more about individual preferences,

287
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.640
is there any possibility what they have done in the uh

288
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.830
Faculty of Law for exa MP that they actually split rooms?

289
00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:45.719
And so we would take uh

290
00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:48.000
one of the two people rooms and split it and you

291
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.020
would see that you would have the sa me size office,

292
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:51.530
but that would give the privacy

293
00:14:51.859 --> 00:14:52.359
um

294
00:14:53.049 --> 00:14:54.359
in so far as in

295
00:14:54.479 --> 00:14:56.840
just about every other faculty in the building,

296
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.039
every professor has their own office.

297
00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:04.909
And it's, it's really uh goes a bit far that we have to have this uh all the sharing. Uh

298
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.760
so one option and that,

299
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:09.950
but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms

300
00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:12.190
for boxes, for instance,

301
00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:14.070
in the, in the bigger rooms where

302
00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:14.320
you

303
00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:15.190
like

304
00:15:15.719 --> 00:15:16.440
cubicles

305
00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:19.010
that doesn't really solve it.

306
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.400
I mean, there's, there's really a difference in having to have your own. Yeah.

307
00:15:23.409 --> 00:15:27.799
And sometimes you have, uh you need to have private discussions with somebody or

308
00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:29.039
whatever. So,

309
00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.739
yeah, II I will try to find out whether we can separate, I think for the moment,

310
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.950
the answer a t least is no because,

311
00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:40.900
um, it's not only well making a wall but also making a new door.

312
00:15:40.979 --> 00:15:45.700
So it's quite a lot of uh, of work. But um, I will try to find this out for the next time.

313
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:49.539
Um So a t least for the moment as you can see

314
00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:52.159
there a re uh I can show them here on the screen.

315
00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:54.239
So there a re these two rooms on the left

316
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.080
that uh accommodate one person.

317
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.679
So a t least some of the professors since you a re four,

318
00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:04.799
could, could go, well, could take these, uh, these rooms

319
00:16:05.619 --> 00:16:08.000
and quite a lot of rooms with two persons.

320
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.710
Uh, how do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistant?

321
00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:15.929
So, the one which is the most involved in, in the teaching?

322
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.210
-- Well, I, I
-- think it's really a matter of personal preference as, you know, um,

323
00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:22.409
I prefer to have my own office.

324
00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:23.239
Um,

325
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.729
I also have a lot of phone calls and,

326
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:26.369
you know,

327
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.330
have to see people and with the other work that I'm doing with the rhetoric, uh

328
00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:33.330
that is really confidential information that I'm treating.

329
00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:34.500
So I,

330
00:16:34.609 --> 00:16:38.510
that I have to be really careful about too, but it's a personal preference uh

331
00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:41.969
in so far as what we've had up until now, both Maggie and Pierrette

332
00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.880
have been happy to share with others.

333
00:16:44.369 --> 00:16:46.580
So, I mean, I think that we should still check with them. I

334
00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:47.380
fully agree with that.

335
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.530
That's uh it's much easier to me to uh

336
00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:52.210
to foresee having two people of the same position,

337
00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:53.000
sharing a room

338
00:16:53.849 --> 00:16:55.229
but not sharing with each other.

339
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.559
-- They
-- sharing with their

340
00:16:57.369 --> 00:16:58.739
students because that, that's, it's,

341
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:02.229
it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons. As you said,

342
00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:06.969
you, you a re discussing a budget on the, on the project, you over the phone.

343
00:17:06.979 --> 00:17:09.608
Typically you don't necessarily want to have somebody

344
00:17:09.739 --> 00:17:10.660
who will be

345
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.880
dependent on the budget

346
00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:15.199
being part of the discussion. So

347
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.449
yeah, that's um that's true.

348
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.290
Um, okay.

349
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.880
Um, maybe we could look a bit a t the projects. Do you think

350
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.869
it's a good idea to put together in the SA Me Room as much as possible?

351
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.030
People from the SA ME projects, since they talk

352
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.030
quite a lot of

353
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.229
the

354
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.979
project doesn't last in time.

355
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.209
They will change.

356
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:36.550
It's

357
00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:37.869
the only thing that will not,

358
00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:41.530
uh, that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people.

359
00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:43.939
Well, yeah,

360
00:17:43.949 --> 00:17:48.449
and some of the phd students will hopefully they will finish their phd A T some point.

361
00:17:50.989 --> 00:17:51.099
Mmhm

362
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.180
Yeah.

363
00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:54.699
And also some of our the people mentioned here

364
00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:56.760
a re working on more than one project too.

365
00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:57.619
So

366
00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.670
for example,

367
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.569
Marianne the fin she's also working with me on the virtual campus project.

368
00:18:03.579 --> 00:18:03.790
So

369
00:18:04.239 --> 00:18:05.949
she that one wasn't mentioned.

370
00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:09.010
I'm not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office.

371
00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.349
But uh it's just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project.

372
00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:15.680
-- If
-- it, if it, if projects are what you have in mind,

373
00:18:15.689 --> 00:18:18.390
I think that the meeting room is the the tool for that

374
00:18:18.844 --> 00:18:21.385
you need to have people in the project talking together,

375
00:18:21.395 --> 00:18:22.535
they just have a meeting room.

376
00:18:22.545 --> 00:18:24.785
If it's not too far away, then then it's a very good

377
00:18:25.555 --> 00:18:28.974
well actu so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room.

378
00:18:28.984 --> 00:18:33.545
But there a re also more formal meeting rooms available inin the building as

379
00:18:34.055 --> 00:18:38.824
-- why I was
-- quite receptive to uh Susan's remark. A t the beginning is

380
00:18:39.329 --> 00:18:43.949
I wouldn't formulate it in uh such uh an extreme way as do we really need a lounge?

381
00:18:43.959 --> 00:18:48.000
But uh I would probably formulate it in a way that uh do we want

382
00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.349
to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room?

383
00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:55.420
Because, because meeting rooms to me,

384
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.180
a re very important tools to do uh collaborative work.

385
00:18:59.359 --> 00:18:59.390
But

386
00:18:59.800 --> 00:18:59.949
I think

387
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.280
we need to have to relax. So

388
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:01.459
that's,

389
00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:06.489
and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge,

390
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.979
-- which is a
-- whole other topic.

391
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.680
No, I um the lounge. Okay.

392
00:19:11.689 --> 00:19:14.560
But I think we need to also see it as a overflow

393
00:19:14.569 --> 00:19:17.989
place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time.

394
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.420
-- So they actually have a place to work
-- cause that's really my,

395
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.040
one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it's, it

396
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.930
pro provides no

397
00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:28.229
possible possibilities of expansion

398
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.390
and this will happen. I mean, you can't, you can't prevent having visitors

399
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.420
-- and you
-- should.

400
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:34.229
Yeah.

401
00:19:34.569 --> 00:19:38.780
Yeah. For the moment, actually, I think only one slot would be fully free.

402
00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.010
Uh That is for

403
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.310
-- people. It's not
-- enough.

404
00:19:41.439 --> 00:19:45.150
Yeah, that means one visitor a T A time or one intern. Yeah, that

405
00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:47.739
professors here and, and,

406
00:19:48.209 --> 00:19:48.599
and it's funny

407
00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:48.989
that we

408
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.300
building because we run out of space and we will have the sa me problem.

409
00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:56.650
Yes. But we have more space here than what we

410
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.810
-- currently have. Yeah, it's
-- already a progress

411
00:19:59.109 --> 00:20:01.400
and you're, you're working.

412
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.660
Uh, I think, yeah. W

413
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:03.430
okay.

414
00:20:03.439 --> 00:20:05.989
So, one of the things I have to do for the next time is find,

415
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.359
-- find out about the separations between rooms
-- because this

416
00:20:09.369 --> 00:20:11.709
is really related with security regulation as well.

417
00:20:11.719 --> 00:20:14.150
I mean, you can't just put walls inin rooms.

418
00:20:14.589 --> 00:20:15.819
Yeah, I think it's quite a heavy

419
00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:19.380
-- transformation of the building, not
-- necessarily heavy in terms of work.

420
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.109
It's heavy in terms of administrative authorisation

421
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.900
and okay,

422
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.829
I'll try to find out.

423
00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:27.380
And the other question is,

424
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:34.209
-- can we squeeze maybe four people in the A or a t least four places in the 33 p
-- room?

425
00:20:34.219 --> 00:20:36.229
I think. So if you organise the desks in a,

426
00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:38.869
in a intelligent way,

427
00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:44.060
yeah, hopefully visitors don't need as much say, filing space or

428
00:20:44.239 --> 00:20:44.660
uh

429
00:20:45.589 --> 00:20:47.390
yeah, they don't have that many papers.

430
00:20:47.729 --> 00:20:50.979
Uh Okay. So that's uh I have to, to ask.

431
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.949
So you don't really feel um very strongly

432
00:20:53.959 --> 00:20:56.969
attached to this uh grouping by project idea.

433
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.969
Mm-hmm.

434
00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:58.979
No,

435
00:20:58.989 --> 00:21:01.739
because they can share their ideas across the project and

436
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.079
-- it's uh coffee
-- machines that they made for them.

437
00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:07.920
Yeah. Usually when, when newer assistants come,

438
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.319
they would like to share the room with someone that knows

439
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.920
uh uh it's related

440
00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.319
with the project. So

441
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.109
you can

442
00:21:15.339 --> 00:21:16.040
see that's

443
00:21:16.209 --> 00:21:18.310
proximity doesn't play a big role there.

444
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.109
You can discuss

445
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.099
with people and

446
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.920
the space is very small. I mean, all together it's,

447
00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.160
and uh you don't, you, you don't need to discuss about the projects.

448
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.540
You f more need about the, to discuss about where is the printer?

449
00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:32.219
How do I get furniture?

450
00:21:32.589 --> 00:21:37.560
I'm, I don't have a, a pencil. Where is the, the box with the pencils and so on?

451
00:21:37.569 --> 00:21:39.170
This is not project related.

452
00:21:41.989 --> 00:21:43.959
You know, if you look now at the, at the,

453
00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:46.859
the current division of the offices, for example,

454
00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:49.270
uh Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office

455
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.209
and they're working on totally different projects and

456
00:21:51.489 --> 00:21:53.160
then they're, they're just fine with that.

457
00:21:54.369 --> 00:21:56.969
Yeah, I think that's, that's going to be one of the,

458
00:21:56.979 --> 00:22:01.150
the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences,

459
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.910
either in staying with someone or in, uh not staying,

460
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:05.630
um,

461
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.160
a re you aware of any strong constraints right now?

462
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.609
Well, there, there were, but they sort of disappeared

463
00:22:12.719 --> 00:22:12.849
as of

464
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.939
October when,

465
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.900
you know, smoking

466
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:16.849
because before we were

467
00:22:17.329 --> 00:22:19.349
smokers and now that there's no smoking,

468
00:22:19.699 --> 00:22:22.119
I guess that's not very important option though.

469
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:24.900
Ok. Yeah, that's true. So, smoking is now

470
00:22:25.329 --> 00:22:27.119
no longer a constrain.

471
00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:27.479
Well,

472
00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:27.729
except

473
00:22:27.969 --> 00:22:27.989
for

474
00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:28.780
maybe you don't

475
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.869
want anybody smoking on your balcony. So,

476
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.170
is it allowed to smoke inside an office if it's one

477
00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.719
person? Not anymore?

478
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.380
No, it's

479
00:22:38.199 --> 00:22:41.280
in principle, it's a, it's a no smoking building, you can smoke outside

480
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.839
so you can go outside onto the,

481
00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:44.650
not

482
00:22:45.579 --> 00:22:45.670
even

483
00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:50.459
-- regulation for
-- all of the 6000 students on

484
00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:50.589
the

485
00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:50.800
roof,

486
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.680
uh, on the balcony. Actual,

487
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.550
-- normally
-- there's the, there's that terrace

488
00:22:56.839 --> 00:22:56.869
but

489
00:22:57.319 --> 00:22:59.349
just, there's no place inside the building,

490
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.209
it's a no

491
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.260
smoking campus but there a re some places

492
00:23:04.849 --> 00:23:06.069
still, some places where

493
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:06.790
can see

494
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:07.810
but,

495
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:07.939
and

496
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:08.310
just

497
00:23:08.699 --> 00:23:10.829
about, about your, your previous uh request.

498
00:23:10.839 --> 00:23:10.920
I,

499
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.869
I don think that anyone will provide you information such as

500
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.550
who doesn't want to be with whom that's a typical uh

501
00:23:18.349 --> 00:23:20.920
output of ex uh research and expert systems.

502
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.739
These a re the rules that you'll never get, but uh you can get them through a proposal.

503
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.150
So you propose a

504
00:23:26.479 --> 00:23:29.520
set up where people a re with other peoples

505
00:23:29.729 --> 00:23:32.599
and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that

506
00:23:32.609 --> 00:23:34.709
uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains,

507
00:23:34.719 --> 00:23:36.739
but they prefer to have view on the old town.

508
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.400
-- So they
-- on the toilets,

509
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.030
they would prefer to be in another.

510
00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:45.800
We, we do have one constraint that's difficult, which is um

511
00:23:46.189 --> 00:23:48.160
Gisela because when she's there, she's very noisy.

512
00:23:51.949 --> 00:23:51.989
Part

513
00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:52.140
of

514
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.180
the nature of her work that

515
00:23:55.699 --> 00:23:55.709
uh

516
00:23:56.589 --> 00:23:56.729
yes,

517
00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.319
Martin said also for him and yeah, especially for her.

518
00:24:00.489 --> 00:24:01.089
Yeah, the I

519
00:24:01.219 --> 00:24:02.290
she's the interface.

520
00:24:02.719 --> 00:24:03.540
-- And
-- so that's a problem.

521
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.640
You're right because, because we don't have a one person,

522
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:12.119
we d we don't have enough one person rooms for accommodating the uh the admin place.

523
00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:17.319
And if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space, who who,

524
00:24:17.329 --> 00:24:18.540
who else will you put in there?

525
00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.510
Because we don't have any uh system manager or we don't have,

526
00:24:22.819 --> 00:24:26.290
we have only one half, part, half time, uh admin

527
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.109
and no other non researcher positions if I'm not mistaken.

528
00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:33.890
And this is really a piece of a problem. Maybe you could put some visitors. But, um,

529
00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:35.060
yeah,

530
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:35.780
I,

531
00:24:36.319 --> 00:24:36.329
uh

532
00:24:36.459 --> 00:24:37.770
realistic. Inainain, I

533
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:38.540
think putting

534
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.060
Gisela with the other admin of the school

535
00:24:41.069 --> 00:24:43.319
is not an option because we weren't offered.

536
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.500
Yeah, it would be nice. But uh

537
00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:48.420
okay, I'll try to find out but uh

538
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:49.420
-- the research
-- there,

539
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.560
let's just either you lose one position or

540
00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:54.599
you find another admin or assistant manager.

541
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:56.189
Yeah, I

542
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.640
-- mean,
-- there is certainly enough space uh down the hall

543
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.709
with all of those uh uh offices that a re

544
00:25:02.949 --> 00:25:06.109
where half of them a re also half time and they're very under used.

545
00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:08.910
-- So, um
-- okay, we'll try but all these, yeah, a re

546
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.900
say sort of difficult questions because they involve

547
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.750
changing also the offices of the school and,

548
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:17.000
you know, people just don't wanna change in general.

549
00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:17.930
Um

550
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.420
Let's see, maybe we can find some temporary, well, a t least a proposal for

551
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:22.910
Gisela.

552
00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:25.780
So since the one person rooms a re quite

553
00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:29.469
well sort of um desired by a lot of people,

554
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:29.949
she

555
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.579
-- should
-- probably

556
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:32.380
there a re to me there,

557
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.500
a re two options possible is either we can take

558
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:40.180
one of the one person rooms for the admin because

559
00:25:40.709 --> 00:25:44.660
some of typically the professors have good reasons for sharing,

560
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.189
sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with

561
00:25:48.199 --> 00:25:51.489
some of their uh one of their phd students.

562
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.689
In that case, it's, it's realistic, then we could very, very simply

563
00:25:55.819 --> 00:25:59.199
uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin.

564
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:00.510
And that would solve the problem.

565
00:26:00.939 --> 00:26:03.589
The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin.

566
00:26:03.599 --> 00:26:06.380
That could be the one, close to the, close to the, um,

567
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.630
-- here in the centre. So, uh, the, the,
-- the middle one here

568
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.680
-- but
-- the no, no, no, the other one, the, the one up. Yeah, this

569
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:13.829
one.

570
00:26:14.069 --> 00:26:14.280
Ok.

571
00:26:14.589 --> 00:26:16.050
But then uh that the,

572
00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:20.469
the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open.

573
00:26:21.459 --> 00:26:24.160
So I would be, I would be more of the opinion to, to see whether it's,

574
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.670
it's so evident that let's say the A t least the two full,

575
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.380
full time professors that a re here on the list, we have one here.

576
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.469
But uh Maggie is, is not present if they really,

577
00:26:36.849 --> 00:26:37.119
yeah,

578
00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:37.819
if,

579
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:38.609
if,

580
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.160
because of personal preferences,

581
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.390
they would be happy with a two person room

582
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.300
which might or might not be the case.

583
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.569
I mean, it's, it's certainly not uh, something that we should impose, but we can ask.

584
00:26:50.739 --> 00:26:52.300
-- Yeah,
-- because in this case, yeah,

585
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.219
Gisela could take one of the,

586
00:26:54.229 --> 00:26:58.109
the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor,

587
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.430
-- but it's not
-- realistic neither.

588
00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:00.369
I mean, you have,

589
00:27:00.439 --> 00:27:03.709
you have a for foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put,

590
00:27:03.719 --> 00:27:05.270
put him in the admin office.

591
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.229
Okay.

592
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.280
-- Uh, you'll not
-- do that. I mean, uh, maybe you can do that with an exchange student.

593
00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:11.780
That's

594
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:12.709
ann

595
00:27:14.329 --> 00:27:18.430
but you can't take a senior visitor and, uh, to sit him in the, in the

596
00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:19.839
-- secretary
-- we, we invite

597
00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:21.589
and then we say, OK, you can.

598
00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:24.790
Yeah, OK.

599
00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.810
Okay. So this sets a bit the stage for uh for

600
00:27:29.089 --> 00:27:29.770
Gisela then

601
00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.560
uh yeah, we'll try to, to find out.

602
00:27:32.859 --> 00:27:33.709
Um Actually, yeah,

603
00:27:33.719 --> 00:27:36.540
maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors A T

604
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.150
the A T the school actually share their office with their assistant.

605
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.689
-- So it looks like sort of an implicit tradition, maybe not to be
-- for

606
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:45.319
every

607
00:27:45.459 --> 00:27:45.680
other

608
00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:46.660
faculty.

609
00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:47.719
OK.

610
00:27:48.839 --> 00:27:49.699
Yes, it is. So

611
00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:52.260
every other faculty as far as

612
00:27:52.469 --> 00:27:55.900
I have seen their offices and the people that I know

613
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.290
and that's in um

614
00:27:58.359 --> 00:27:59.160
in law,

615
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.400
socio economics. Uh OK. It's

616
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:05.439
uh they all have their own office,

617
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.739
I mean, and, and the,

618
00:28:06.869 --> 00:28:09.500
-- and the law faculty, they a best they have
-- done,

619
00:28:09.619 --> 00:28:12.089
as we said, it's, it's really a matter of personal preference.

620
00:28:12.099 --> 00:28:14.560
It cannot be something else it can be imposed for sure.

621
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.020
Um

622
00:28:17.689 --> 00:28:19.050
Okay, so I think,

623
00:28:19.209 --> 00:28:21.689
well, this sets a bit the, the stage.

624
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.819
Uh could we try? So could you try please to

625
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.500
uh do you want an extra uh piece of paper, maybe try to, well,

626
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:34.180
-- think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you
-- again.

627
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.969
Uh uh Andre, I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our,

628
00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:40.099
for ourselves.

629
00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:43.739
I can tell you according to what I know now

630
00:28:43.949 --> 00:28:47.219
where I would like or would be ready to be,

631
00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:52.010
but I really don't see how I could decide for, uh, Maggie or Pierre

632
00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:54.449
-- or whoever
-- else on the list

633
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.250
was to try

634
00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:55.760
to,

635
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.729
well, just talk to them like

636
00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:02.280
-- we do
-- it like for, for the, the set up of meetings. You, you,

637
00:29:02.579 --> 00:29:06.959
everyone received that and, uh, should provide. Yeah, I would like to be here

638
00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:08.290
and then

639
00:29:08.449 --> 00:29:09.390
you will have this

640
00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:12.400
multi constrained problem and, uh, you work during two

641
00:29:12.819 --> 00:29:13.170
hours and

642
00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:18.060
you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's places,

643
00:29:19.469 --> 00:29:19.489
the

644
00:29:20.469 --> 00:29:21.150
thing you want to know.

645
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.560
-- But what
-- about the, the, the cafeteria? I mean, we a re going to pay

646
00:29:24.709 --> 00:29:26.829
us a cafeteria with a projector and

647
00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:27.569
all this

648
00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:28.550
all together or

649
00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:29.099
living

650
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:30.290
it's all together.

651
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.069
But that's an open question. Whether it's a, it's a, it's a, it,

652
00:29:35.189 --> 00:29:39.229
a t the origin, it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, uh,

653
00:29:39.239 --> 00:29:41.829
reading the newspapers, t cetera, et cetera.

654
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.829
Uh, there has been a very long discussion about that.

655
00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:45.329
I think sh uh,

656
00:29:45.339 --> 00:29:48.280
this discussion is still vivid that some of the people I

657
00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.790
bel belong to these people would like to have a mixed

658
00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:55.540
room where you can have a reading room for sure. But also a meeting room if necessary.

659
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.229
Or as uh Susan said, a room,

660
00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:03.829
an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for,

661
00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:05.160
for, for, for work

662
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.410
because you don't have any other place to do it.

663
00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.640
But that's, that's really an open discussion that,

664
00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:12.069
that I think no decision, no final.

665
00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:13.079
Okay,

666
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.729
then taken about that. Okay, then for the next time

667
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.239
uh trying to come up either with your own preferences,

668
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.829
that's quite easy probably to state now that, you know,

669
00:30:21.839 --> 00:30:26.670
the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be,

670
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:27.650
I mean, the

671
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:28.550
one that I don't want

672
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.760
you have in the next room.

673
00:30:29.969 --> 00:30:31.109
Well, just discuss it.

674
00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:32.719
Yeah, for instance, I mean, no, no,

675
00:30:32.729 --> 00:30:36.530
I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this.

676
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.969
And I think, yeah, it would be nice to, to come with maybe a sketch of, of these.

677
00:30:40.979 --> 00:30:44.599
If you can do slides, it's even better. But uh don't be that formal

678
00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:47.469
and uh we'll try to a t least build up

679
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:52.170
one coherent proposal and we'll merge it with the other one

680
00:30:52.329 --> 00:30:54.349
when the other one is available.

681
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.180
I'll

682
00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.150
ask um

683
00:30:56.449 --> 00:30:56.459
uh

684
00:30:58.770 --> 00:30:58.800
that,

685
00:31:01.089 --> 00:31:03.369
that, that of course, is one of the main,

686
00:31:03.709 --> 00:31:05.619
well, not main, but one of the important

687
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.439
-- features
-- that we need to. Yeah,

688
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.310
they're not a t the meeting. I think it's, uh,

689
00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:11.050
and I'll try to

690
00:31:12.069 --> 00:31:13.750
just before finishing. Uh, I mean,

691
00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:14.920
we have a cafeteria

692
00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:16.209
-- or we don't need a t
-- all,

693
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.290
what do you mean by cafeteria?

694
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:19.130
Exactly.

695
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.069
What, uh, we can take a coffee also.

696
00:31:22.969 --> 00:31:24.410
There is no coffee in the reading room.

697
00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:27.699
-- We can bring your coffee in the reading
-- room and

698
00:31:28.459 --> 00:31:28.670
buying

699
00:31:28.859 --> 00:31:28.969
the

700
00:31:29.109 --> 00:31:29.439
coffee machine.

701
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:30.130
So, so

702
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.619
since maybe you're part time here and part time, part time.

703
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.050
A tepfl there a reat least two

704
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.400
coffee machines in the building. One A T the third floor, one A T the first floor

705
00:31:40.569 --> 00:31:41.089
and we can close

706
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:41.630
our coffee,

707
00:31:42.229 --> 00:31:44.239
no uh automatic uh coffee machine.

708
00:31:44.474 --> 00:31:44.614
Ok.

709
00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:44.994
So

710
00:31:45.114 --> 00:31:45.125
uh

711
00:31:45.464 --> 00:31:45.484
yeah,

712
00:31:46.035 --> 00:31:48.155
-- no, there's
-- the cafeterias downstairs

713
00:31:48.364 --> 00:31:50.074
but they close A T five.

714
00:31:50.265 --> 00:31:50.405
The

715
00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:51.415
main problem. Yeah,

716
00:31:51.854 --> 00:31:54.515
but there's the two machines and they're uh

717
00:31:54.625 --> 00:31:55.974
the vending machines where you just put

718
00:31:56.185 --> 00:31:56.204
the

719
00:31:56.474 --> 00:31:56.525
machine

720
00:31:57.194 --> 00:31:58.525
and you can bring your coffee in the,

721
00:31:59.694 --> 00:32:04.155
