Hello, these a re sexist microphones. They uh

1
00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.070
they a re made for women's shirts.

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.329
No, mine's the opposite.

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:10.800
Um Okay.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.029
So um

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.670
let's start.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.610
Um

7
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.930
Thanks for coming again to this meeting.

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.000
I hope it won't be too long and especially that will make some progress on uh

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.899
this uh this small task that is putting people in our new rooms.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.389
Uh I hope you had fun in uh well,

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.349
designing something or uh asking the people about

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.880
their preferences and uh things like this.

13
00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:41.479
So yeah, that's what I was talking about. It's for women's shirts.

14
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.669
Um

15
00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.610
So um

16
00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.529
well, I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings.

17
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.590
I think you'll be more and more used to it

18
00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.310
as, as soon as we move.

19
00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:57.669
So we have these one person, two person and three person rooms.

20
00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:02.380
Um And so that makes I think 18 places

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.910
and we had about 15 people and some uh spare uh spare, well working places to to put

22
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.610
um may I first uh provide the answers to the, the questions from the last time?

23
00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.739
-- And I also
-- checked with uh Maggie and

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.220
Oh, great.

25
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.440
Yeah, so that will be part of the, your uh your solution or suggestions,

26
00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:24.230
the solution.

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.040
But regarding the constraints,

28
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.080
um there is no immediate plan to, to make separations between the rooms.

29
00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:36.970
So that means basically what we have to do with this setting. And uh

30
00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.199
it's, it's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls.

31
00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.089
So I think we shouldn't count on them in the next uh four years maybe.

32
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.300
And they don't want us to sh, I mean,

33
00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.699
they don't want to provide an extra working space for

34
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.599
Gisela with the other a, the admins

35
00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:57.919
which we could understand because it's sort of full over there.

36
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.879
But uh a t least that's what they said.

37
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.129
So it seems we, uh,

38
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.270
yeah, they, well, we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us though.

39
00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.500
It wouldn't be a bad thing maybe. But, um,

40
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.720
we'll see

41
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.250
so regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the 23 person rooms.

42
00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.789
Um, well, it's not very easy.

43
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.380
We'll have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing

44
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.660
it. It looks like it's not impossible. A t least on the one that is a bit uh longer

45
00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.649
on, on the right. So, uh the one here,

46
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.009
it should be possible to put four persons.

47
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.470
If we could avoid it, it would much simplify things. But uh my

48
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.979
question is, is it,

49
00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.619
is it

50
00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.750
-- against the regulation, security regulation?
-- No,

51
00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.869
-- no,
-- no.

52
00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.800
And I, and I went over and I looked a t that room too.

53
00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.679
There's plenty of space for four people.

54
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.059
Yeah, I think, yeah, it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture.

55
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.000
But uh, since we a re experts, a t this task,

56
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.830
uh okay.

57
00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:04.350
So maybe we could count on, on four places, but the final decision is not really ours.

58
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.009
So, um,

59
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.399
-- we'll see actually that would be
-- fine if this one of the person is 50%.

60
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.679
So

61
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.160
for exa

62
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.289
m

63
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.660
exactly or one of the intern positions, the people who might come

64
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.949
something like that.

65
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.229
Um Okay, so these were the um

66
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.529
the answers.

67
00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.820
So actually I, I did my uh

68
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:28.880
my proposal as a slide. Would you like me to start or would you like me to end

69
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.289
it?

70
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.020
Complete? Uh

71
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.860
I talked both with Maggie and Pierre

72
00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:34.419
and

73
00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.850
both of them were happy to share offices.

74
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.070
They have no problem with some.

75
00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:41.630
Uh they're, they're easy but uh could be

76
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.820
uh as Pierre

77
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.970
has right now that she could, she's happy to continue to share with Marian

78
00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.820
and Maggie for example, to share with uh

79
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:52.470
it could be with Bruno because they work on the Swiss

80
00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.119
-- together and they like to gossip together. So,
-- yeah.

81
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.289
Okay. Then let me um explain very briefly, the, the rationale for,

82
00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.289
for this.

83
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.139
So it's the sa me uh

84
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.529
schema that, you know, in red you have the

85
00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.690
uh uh oh excuse me. That's quite uh annoying. Excuse me.

86
00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.000
Um Hello.

87
00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.700
Oh, yeah. Um Can, can I call you a bit later in about half an hour?

88
00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.829
I'm just in the middle of a meeting and I'm talking.

89
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.350
Oh,

90
00:04:24.459 --> 00:04:26.109
okay. Thank you. Bye bye.

91
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.179
Um Sorry for this.

92
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.119
Fortunately we were just uh the four of us.

93
00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:33.170
Um

94
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.010
Okay, so let me get back to, to the proposal after a brief interruption.

95
00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.769
Um So the NA Mes A rein red now. Um

96
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.179
well, one of the reasons a t least for me for doing this was to more or less group people

97
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.179
uh with within projects because I, I think that sometimes they,

98
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.309
they just discuss together and uh it's easier if they're in the SA ME office

99
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.369
and um which is quite happy.

100
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.630
Actually, I, I also thought that some professors might enjoy or a t least uh

101
00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.980
don't, don't say anything about being with their assistant.

102
00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:11.779
So I was happy to hear Susan

103
00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:16.200
um saying that Maggie and Bruno could go on well together and

104
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.059
Pierrette and uh Marian Inin the Sa Me office.

105
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.890
Um So

106
00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:24.500
what I can say is uh that

107
00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:27.570
I also understood that Susan would be rather in

108
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:30.209
favour of uh well having her own office.

109
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.880
So uh it's, it's, it's working like this.

110
00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:35.390
I put the lounge in the middle.

111
00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.450
It's also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows.

112
00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:41.910
So I think that's not a problem because you're

113
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.269
not going to just stay there and stare outside.

114
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.160
Uh But it's, it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office. I guess

115
00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:52.000
putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge.

116
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.519
I don't know. Yeah. Maybe I thought in an angle but that's obviously not very,

117
00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:59.290
you a re printing all the time.

118
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.130
-- Yeah. Why
-- not put the printer out in the

119
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.890
-- hallway? Okay.
-- And so next to the photocopy, maybe it wouldn't be a bad place here.

120
00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.299
-- Is there
-- any space there for photocopy and printer?

121
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.540
Yeah, we'll have to check the,

122
00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:16.760
yeah, but the printer is quite small. If we find, find just a small table for it.

123
00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:21.109
M maybe, maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer. So

124
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.670
okay. But I, I wouldn't s well insist on this, I think. Okay.

125
00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:29.429
So the printer will, will remove it if we work from this uh this solution.

126
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.190
So um im two is more or less in the upper left side.

127
00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:36.429
Um I said more or less

128
00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.510
um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have Swiss

129
00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:42.470
and

130
00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:45.380
Parmenides. So the two projects from the list

131
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.779
and then me

132
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.299
SLT on the on the right side,

133
00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:52.760
maybe not a ve a very good solution for G

134
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.190
if you can suggest something uh better because she's with two people who

135
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.630
uh well, two phd students

136
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.309
and it's true that she has, yeah, a lot of phone calls to make.

137
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.950
But um it's some way to, to solve some constraints. I think this is a very open thing.

138
00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.799
Uh If you want, we can use this document or we could just

139
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.369
say first listen to your suggestions and see if

140
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.779
we erase everything or just do some modifications using

141
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:22.239
question.

142
00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:26.230
What's the justification for giving Nancy her own office?

143
00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:29.950
Um Yeah, maybe not a very strong one.

144
00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:36.299
And I, maybe you a re you have better suggestions. Um It was, I think, sort of one of the

145
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.459
uh places they re that remain.

146
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.339
And I, I think, yeah, there is no strong constraint and uh

147
00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:45.089
well, she's a smoker but the policy is that we don't smoke.

148
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.890
So it's even better if she's uh with a second person,

149
00:07:48.019 --> 00:07:48.029
I

150
00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:48.309
have

151
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.829
a

152
00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:49.720
suggestion to put

153
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:50.160
Gisela

154
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:51.500
to switch Nancy and

155
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:51.929
Gisela.

156
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.220
Uh huh.

157
00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:54.429
Ok.

158
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:54.549
A

159
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:56.640
the facts on the printing machine,

160
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.260
the printer

161
00:07:58.559 --> 00:07:59.589
in the one person room,

162
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.190
Gisela

163
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.480
will

164
00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:03.779
not be very happy about that. Uh

165
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.779
We tried that and

166
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.839
Gisela really didn't like to have the printer

167
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.880
and people in and out.

168
00:08:11.799 --> 00:08:14.609
Yeah, that was the case. And uh she was a bit, uh

169
00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:18.390
an admin room

170
00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:19.760
clearly identified as

171
00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:21.950
an admin room and only an admin room.

172
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.450
We could store files there where you

173
00:08:24.829 --> 00:08:24.970
can

174
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.200
close

175
00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:25.459
it.

176
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.019
You have the personal files of the, of the people of the, of the, of the unit,

177
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.959
-- et cetera,
-- et cetera.

178
00:08:30.269 --> 00:08:32.229
Okay. So if you want, I can already

179
00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:32.440
do

180
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.960
-- this change
-- here against the fact that my personal files,

181
00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.510
a reinafinain a room that is not specifically dedicated for that.

182
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:42.130
The

183
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.530
professors, uh, you have,

184
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.929
there's no printer or there's only one printer.

185
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.700
Um, because if not the person, the printer can go in a room of three people.

186
00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:56.429
That's typical case where there's the lab and there's, the printer is there.

187
00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:59.109
Yeah. But the printer can be in the, in the,

188
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.739
-- yeah,
-- the, yeah, when the printer is, yeah, it's, it's the main one.

189
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.119
We have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room.

190
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.530
But it's basically, yeah, the pe the, the printer where everybody prints.

191
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.099
Um,

192
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.070
so I changed this.

193
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.479
So maybe I would suggest

194
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.010
let me le c can I hear also? Let, let us hear from you

195
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:22.159
and then

196
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.520
if we can work out the solu common solution from this one, then we go back to,

197
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.440
to this slide

198
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.299
and if not, um, we'll just, I'll start from scratch

199
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.570
right to share the room with you is a view on the old town, let's say.

200
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:37.289
Mm-hmm.

201
00:09:38.169 --> 00:09:40.549
Okay. You have to be aware of what I was

202
00:09:40.669 --> 00:09:41.890
saying last time

203
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.450
that you will have to suffer some calls

204
00:09:44.849 --> 00:09:45.559
suffer from p

205
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:46.619
from phone calls.

206
00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:49.140
Yeah, I'll try, I'll bring my walk.

207
00:09:49.469 --> 00:09:49.539
And

208
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.919
uh, David, you had also. Uh

209
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:58.179
Yeah. Okay for

210
00:09:58.609 --> 00:09:58.640
me

211
00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:03.719
as, uh, I don't know, uh, the people a lot.

212
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:07.559
Uh I, I just suggested that uh there's a la a lack of men,

213
00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:08.299
so

214
00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:14.440
I would certainly put, uh, not two men in the sa me office. I would try to share them

215
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:19.440
with the woman. So uh for exa Mples, I would uh in your slide, I would uh switch

216
00:10:19.849 --> 00:10:22.109
either you or Martin with uh

217
00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:23.679
uh

218
00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.719
the other room. This one

219
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.200
uh huh

220
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.549
oh Let me put the plan. Sorry, I will display um

221
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.760
Yeah, this is the empty one. I don't want to influence you. So,

222
00:10:34.289 --> 00:10:35.179
so you would put,

223
00:10:35.419 --> 00:10:38.539
you have to show us which one you were talking about? David? We didn't know.

224
00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:41.739
-- Yeah. Yeah, I was wanting to change this.
-- Uh

225
00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:45.599
-- You c you can even stand and just show us
-- there.

226
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.599
-- Yeah, but I need your uh your slide because I was talking about your
-- slide.

227
00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:53.070
Okay. So you would prefer the na Mes, okay?

228
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.830
I I don't want to influence you too much but uh

229
00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.169
I'm perfectly happy to start

230
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.270
with this as a basis and then change things.

231
00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:05.429
Yeah. So here you can see that

232
00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.450
the men is, I mean they a re always sharing the room with a, with a woman.

233
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.489
I mean, there's Bruno

234
00:11:11.859 --> 00:11:12.500
Me

235
00:11:13.229 --> 00:11:14.409
uh be

236
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:15.929
and Nico

237
00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:16.080
is

238
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.820
also.

239
00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:17.880
Yeah, but for Pierrette

240
00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:19.969
and, and Maggie it's uh it's will,

241
00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:21.960
it's a wish or it's

242
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.239
uh oh

243
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.099
actually

244
00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:24.570
is a woman too.

245
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.770
Sorry. It's the feminine of Pierre.

246
00:11:28.489 --> 00:11:28.570
Mm-hmm.

247
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.590
So I mean this is perfectly

248
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.409
fine and we just changed Martin and Andre for Maria or

249
00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:33.909
Yalena

250
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:34.359
or

251
00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:34.700
Nancy.

252
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.309
Maybe

253
00:11:36.669 --> 00:11:36.690
you

254
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:37.239
didn't get your

255
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:37.770
solution.

256
00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:39.429
What was it again?

257
00:11:39.659 --> 00:11:41.070
Yeah. Here there a re two men.

258
00:11:41.469 --> 00:11:41.849
So,

259
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:42.950
so, I mean, it's

260
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.130
a mix

261
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.849
sexes.

262
00:11:44.369 --> 00:11:44.710
Yeah,

263
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.469
it's nice. I don't think so. I mean, there's a lack of men here ininin this

264
00:11:48.849 --> 00:11:50.000
Inin, this lab.

265
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.080
So I would change one,

266
00:11:52.469 --> 00:11:52.950
each one.

267
00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:56.609
But it's not so much a question of men or women.

268
00:11:56.619 --> 00:11:59.309
It's more the question of, as I said that

269
00:11:59.909 --> 00:11:59.989
uh

270
00:12:02.039 --> 00:12:06.020
um here you have only p, you have phd students that a re regroup

271
00:12:06.169 --> 00:12:10.409
there, you have s senior researchers that a re regrouped, which is to me more

272
00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:14.679
unless it corresponds to some specific demand.

273
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.429
Like it is in the case, in Maggie, in Maggie's case, in

274
00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:18.190
Pierre's case,

275
00:12:18.539 --> 00:12:21.119
I think that's a very efficient way of doing things.

276
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:22.530
Yeah.

277
00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:23.780
And for me, it's also, I,

278
00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:27.559
I would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office just to be.

279
00:12:30.239 --> 00:12:31.469
So I'm very happy with you

280
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.510
propose this,

281
00:12:33.619 --> 00:12:36.719
but I could also be happy with most of the other people.

282
00:12:36.729 --> 00:12:39.530
So even in a three person room, it's, it's fine.

283
00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:44.929
Okay. So let's keep in mind maybe this uh constraint of balancing the, the genders.

284
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.330
Uh

285
00:12:45.719 --> 00:12:47.650
We'll see if we can uh

286
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.330
do something for it.

287
00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.260
Andre, did you ask these people if this was okay with them?

288
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.880
Uh I've asked some of them

289
00:12:56.289 --> 00:12:59.690
and I've also used a little bit uh what I've, well, I mean, the,

290
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.630
the present arrangement just not to, to shock people too much.

291
00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:07.659
And it's also people that I know um, get on well, quite,

292
00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:12.700
quite well together and also work on the SA me project, like, for instance, Marian,

293
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.780
uh,

294
00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:14.520
uh, the Finnish Marianne

295
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:15.500
and, uh, Nikos

296
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.369
who interact quite a lot on, uh, on me.

297
00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.289
SLT.

298
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:20.729
Um,

299
00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:22.580
yeah, Maria and

300
00:13:22.809 --> 00:13:26.169
Yalena seem to go on one quite, quite well.

301
00:13:27.109 --> 00:13:30.010
Uh, Nancy had no strong preference,

302
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.210
especially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in, in her office.

303
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.760
Um,

304
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:41.690
yeah. So I, I think, well, a t least as far as I, I asked, there was no major objection

305
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.109
-- but
-- isn't there just a, uh, a question of proximities you put David

306
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:46.729
with and yes.

307
00:13:48.099 --> 00:13:49.900
Um, but isn't ANAs

308
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.789
working,

309
00:13:52.969 --> 00:13:53.789
um,

310
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.619
in a,

311
00:13:54.969 --> 00:13:59.500
in a more substantial way in, uh, with people, like, uh, either Maria or

312
00:13:59.619 --> 00:14:00.109
Yalina?

313
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.659
Um,

314
00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:06.320
yeah, that's true.

315
00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:07.679
That's true.

316
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.880
I, um,

317
00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:13.510
c so we could put Nancy with David and, uh, put

318
00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:13.770
Agnes

319
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.190
also

320
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:14.630
working

321
00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:14.830
with.

322
00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:15.530
So,

323
00:14:16.369 --> 00:14:19.520
but we agree that it's not important to, to share the room with someone

324
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.070
-- that has the SA me
-- project here,

325
00:14:22.219 --> 00:14:25.500
the other constraints, a re, uh, satisfied somehow. So.

326
00:14:26.169 --> 00:14:26.869
Mm-hmm.

327
00:14:27.289 --> 00:14:27.390
And more,

328
00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:29.869
and I will be quite happy to have the,

329
00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.619
the full room some 50% of the time.

330
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.289
Yeah, that's a small advantage. And, uh,

331
00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:38.809
I, it's a bit more, uh, more comfortable

332
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:39.570
actually.

333
00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:40.299
Uh, but

334
00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:40.419
I

335
00:14:40.619 --> 00:14:43.210
mean, with, with the three, the 23 person rooms,

336
00:14:43.219 --> 00:14:45.250
I think that they can mix them the way they want.

337
00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:47.250
I mean, if they prefer to be, uh,

338
00:14:47.559 --> 00:14:48.239
Maria,

339
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:48.650
uh,

340
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.419
Yalina Nikos

341
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:51.729
and, uh, Nancy and Marian on the other side.

342
00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:53.479
Well, no, that's not completely equivalent because

343
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.030
Nancy, all a re phd students, a re master students. But Nancy.

344
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.820
Correct.

345
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.900
Yeah. But that doesn't matter.

346
00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:03.820
That's not important.

347
00:15:04.409 --> 00:15:06.840
The one question I was wondering about though, because

348
00:15:06.979 --> 00:15:08.619
three is always, uh,

349
00:15:08.789 --> 00:15:11.869
well, the more people in office, the less ideal

350
00:15:11.969 --> 00:15:16.080
that wouldn't, it maybe be better to put David in since he's only half time.

351
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.830
So that way, then

352
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.679
-- there's not three people all the time.
-- So I would switch David and Nancy typically.

353
00:15:24.479 --> 00:15:28.659
-- Yeah, probably that
-- they should be in this room. Could be in the other one for me.

354
00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:32.739
The 23 people rooms a re really, they have to be reshuffled

355
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.380
according to people personal preferences.

356
00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:35.869
So I

357
00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:37.390
definitely

358
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:38.690
with

359
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.700
-- Agnes in the two person
-- room,

360
00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.789
they, they have worked together on par.

361
00:15:43.239 --> 00:15:45.700
So this makes some sense.

362
00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:46.900
Um

363
00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.630
But again, it's also a question of personal preference. I mean, you, you can't be IR

364
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.119
or the person you don't want to be.

365
00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:56.500
Yeah. As far as I know, I think it's probably quite a good, uh

366
00:15:56.849 --> 00:15:57.690
-- uh good
-- man

367
00:15:58.059 --> 00:15:58.979
that you going to finish

368
00:15:59.349 --> 00:16:00.090
the phd or

369
00:16:01.229 --> 00:16:01.309
uh

370
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:02.929
no.

371
00:16:03.299 --> 00:16:04.950
-- Uh
-- first one should be Maria

372
00:16:05.369 --> 00:16:05.500
but

373
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.789
1.5.

374
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:08.489
Okay.

375
00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:09.010
Let's see. You

376
00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:09.340
do it this

377
00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:09.619
way

378
00:16:10.229 --> 00:16:15.119
that in the 23 people room there will be one that is not so overloaded because of David

379
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:17.729
because David will be part time and the other one

380
00:16:17.739 --> 00:16:20.609
not so overloaded because there is a one free position.

381
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.320
-- Uh, knowing that this one free position, uh, will not stay free very
-- long.

382
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.179
No, because don't forget we already have somebody coming in. Uh, January. Yes.

383
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.229
At least one person.

384
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.969
This is still a worry for me because

385
00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:37.090
we a re still,

386
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.770
we don't, still, still don't have enough space for the visitors.

387
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.109
At least we put them in the lounge.

388
00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:45.200
Yeah.

389
00:16:45.619 --> 00:16:46.400
Yeah, I, I,

390
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.960
yeah.

391
00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:51.229
Yeah.

392
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.640
-- So
-- we have a t least three visitors positions,

393
00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:59.010
positions. Okay. So, since we're supposed to do a final proposal, sorry.

394
00:16:59.039 --> 00:17:01.030
Uh, let me move the printer,

395
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:01.869
um,

396
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.219
uh, next to the photocopier.

397
00:17:05.198 --> 00:17:05.878
Okay.

398
00:17:06.229 --> 00:17:08.888
And we'll find some way to,

399
00:17:09.118 --> 00:17:12.529
um, well, attach it to a wall or something like this

400
00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:14.019
so that we keep it.

401
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.750
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

402
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.339
Um, okay. So that's the, uh,

403
00:17:22.648 --> 00:17:22.739
mm,

404
00:17:23.468 --> 00:17:26.318
I, I don't think we can put visitors in the lounge. It's, uh,

405
00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:30.848
it depends on how we think about the lounge if it's thought as being a reading group.

406
00:17:30.859 --> 00:17:32.489
No, if it's thought as

407
00:17:32.859 --> 00:17:35.558
the que, that, that's really a very important question to me.

408
00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:40.399
Do we, do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our,

409
00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.639
in our offices or in our, uh, workplace,

410
00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:45.749
we can read newspapers elsewhere.

411
00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:50.920
And I really do think it's more important for lab to be able to decently, uh,

412
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.660
welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers,

413
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:56.229
newspapers.

414
00:17:56.239 --> 00:17:57.619
You can read them home, you know,

415
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.400
you can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else.

416
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.150
You can go on the balcony if it's, if it's in the summer. So,

417
00:18:03.589 --> 00:18:08.030
I, I don't understand why we, why we should put priority on lounges. If we,

418
00:18:08.489 --> 00:18:12.050
if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors, that's just not,

419
00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:12.609
not

420
00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.109
to my priorities.

421
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:19.910
-- How
-- would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices, like in,

422
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.689
well, Inin one of the one person offices,

423
00:18:23.359 --> 00:18:27.270
I, I know they a re actually quite uh quite demanded. So, um

424
00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:31.189
I, I think Susan you're very happy with this solution. So let's

425
00:18:31.619 --> 00:18:31.739
book

426
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.459
in

427
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.550
with three visitors.

428
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.189
One person room. Is it

429
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.689
really,

430
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.300
it's probably too small.

431
00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:42.660
It doesn't work

432
00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:46.560
to just remove the lounge. We, it's a luxury for us.

433
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.670
We don't have space for a lounge.

434
00:18:48.949 --> 00:18:49.790
Let's let's be,

435
00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:50.380
let's

436
00:18:50.819 --> 00:18:50.839
be

437
00:18:51.109 --> 00:18:51.119
a

438
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.170
tat the A T the A T the

439
00:18:53.489 --> 00:18:55.189
in front of your colleagues in saying,

440
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.770
IW if I have to choose between a reading my newspaper and this c and having a,

441
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.099
a decently welcomed uh uh research visitor, I prefer

442
00:19:03.215 --> 00:19:05.015
read my newspapers. That's just not

443
00:19:05.235 --> 00:19:06.515
just not realistic,

444
00:19:06.796 --> 00:19:07.796
-- but we a re
-- researchers.

445
00:19:07.806 --> 00:19:12.725
The problem is it, it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we,

446
00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:13.735
we need the lounge.

447
00:19:13.745 --> 00:19:17.615
-- So I, I think it's simply not. No, no I
-- don't think we can choose about.

448
00:19:18.345 --> 00:19:22.206
-- No, actually, I, I, I'm sorry, it's, uh, you
-- have the three people

449
00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:22.566
that

450
00:19:23.722 --> 00:19:28.121
split it in two parts as, as Susan was, was, uh, proposing last time with a,

451
00:19:28.131 --> 00:19:30.822
who was a wall and you have a lounge there and we

452
00:19:30.832 --> 00:19:33.932
can read your newspapers and we have a full two room,

453
00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:37.161
two person room where we can certainly accommodate three

454
00:19:37.171 --> 00:19:39.901
visitors and a t least we have some,

455
00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:42.232
uh, free margin for the next two years or

456
00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.631
so. So

457
00:19:44.072 --> 00:19:45.541
how do we split the room?

458
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:46.619
We

459
00:19:46.829 --> 00:19:46.939
put

460
00:19:47.569 --> 00:19:50.479
the furniture that we got for our reading room,

461
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.479
we put it into the

462
00:19:52.829 --> 00:19:55.000
other half of the three person room.

463
00:19:56.079 --> 00:19:56.229
Would

464
00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:56.430
that

465
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:56.699
fit

466
00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:57.020
a

467
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.050
little

468
00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.109
divider of some kind?

469
00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:02.239
-- But
-- what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge,

470
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.709
supposed to have a discussion in the

471
00:20:03.849 --> 00:20:05.520
lounge? They, a re supposed to read their newspapers.

472
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.489
Well, not the newspapers because

473
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:08.680
no

474
00:20:09.219 --> 00:20:10.550
scientific articles.

475
00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:12.339
No, that's

476
00:20:12.459 --> 00:20:12.489
not

477
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:13.050
the

478
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.510
goal.

479
00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:17.199
The goal of the launch was, was a place where you can relax,

480
00:20:18.719 --> 00:20:18.829
but

481
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.790
-- also to read articles. A t least
-- you can do it in your office.

482
00:20:22.959 --> 00:20:25.160
So you would like to put it. Yeah, with an,

483
00:20:25.449 --> 00:20:26.459
and then who,

484
00:20:26.469 --> 00:20:30.500
-- who
-- you have good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break your heart?

485
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.030
Your, uh, your, your, your back ways in your office?

486
00:20:33.349 --> 00:20:37.770
Yeah. Okay. But then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side,

487
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.130
uh, here

488
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:43.130
and, uh, here we'll put two places for visitors.

489
00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.609
33, but that means the office will be a t least for the moment empty.

490
00:20:47.619 --> 00:20:48.540
-- That looks very
-- bad

491
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.250
visitor that is arriving.

492
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:50.890
Uh,

493
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:51.130
what

494
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:51.579
-- did
-- you say? A

495
00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.189
visitor? It's a new person

496
00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:59.640
-- arriving in
-- January. Okay. So that could take the, the free place over there.

497
00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:00.140
Uh, I

498
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:00.439
mean,

499
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.280
the,

500
00:21:02.719 --> 00:21:05.520
that could take 11 position in the,

501
00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.459
in the, in the, in this place.

502
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:10.359
Yeah, I think.

503
00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:14.969
Okay. So we need what, two free positions and one

504
00:21:15.079 --> 00:21:19.130
new person arriving X or something like that.

505
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.969
Well, that's an idea. If you forget about the lounge,

506
00:21:23.579 --> 00:21:25.949
what you could do is to move either Maria Maria or

507
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.810
Yalina in the, in the what is currently the lounge?

508
00:21:29.339 --> 00:21:30.199
That means that

509
00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:34.209
we have one person there with one free position.

510
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.079
We have one free position in the, in the room that Maria Yarina

511
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.890
is coming from and one free position over there.

512
00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:45.260
So we have three position distributed over the rooms.

513
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.989
But we can,

514
00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.160
I

515
00:21:46.319 --> 00:21:47.489
mean, where is the lounge?

516
00:21:47.709 --> 00:21:47.890
No

517
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:49.900
lounge? Okay. No way

518
00:21:50.199 --> 00:21:53.199
I will, I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge.

519
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.969
-- So of the
-- lounge and you put it in the corridor.

520
00:21:56.739 --> 00:21:59.569
No, no, no, no, let's do the lounge corner.

521
00:21:59.739 --> 00:22:01.040
The lounge is in the freezer. Okay.

522
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.010
A t least, I mean, otherwise I cannot really defend it because it,

523
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.890
it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every,

524
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.939
-- every decision we
-- went to get the budget for it.

525
00:22:11.219 --> 00:22:11.260
Yeah,

526
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:11.640
I think

527
00:22:11.859 --> 00:22:11.880
so.

528
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.199
Yeah,

529
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.000
I will explain to your visitor. Ok. But

530
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.619
unfortunately they have a position in the toilet because

531
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.410
-- there is a reading room where
-- people have to.

532
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.099
Well, let's have the visitors first.

533
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.319
Okay. So what we need is a new and two freeze.

534
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:26.459
So

535
00:22:28.209 --> 00:22:29.550
I think we can put

536
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.719
what Maria or

537
00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:34.540
Yalena, I don't want to separate them really. But uh

538
00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.319
or

539
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.359
my cell, I don't like that office actually.

540
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.839
Um

541
00:22:40.989 --> 00:22:42.800
So I was thinking to put here,

542
00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:43.310
it

543
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:43.930
could be Nikos

544
00:22:44.109 --> 00:22:44.209
for

545
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.380
instance,

546
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.520
-- could put, you can, can
-- switch.

547
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.050
No, we're not gonna keep Marian

548
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.109
in its three

549
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.810
first

550
00:22:49.949 --> 00:22:51.520
place. Uh just having it, Marian

551
00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.560
in the lounge. Yeah.

552
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.579
Yeah. No, we, yeah,

553
00:22:54.869 --> 00:22:56.010
so it's either,

554
00:22:56.939 --> 00:23:00.079
yeah, we could put a visitor with you Martin but it's probably okay.

555
00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.959
Let's try one le let's try this.

556
00:23:02.589 --> 00:23:04.560
Uh let's try Maria here.

557
00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:04.709
I

558
00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:04.989
mean,

559
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:05.280
and

560
00:23:05.579 --> 00:23:06.920
-- oh, do
-- you? You don't mind?

561
00:23:07.349 --> 00:23:09.900
-- Okay? Cause I
-- will be there a half time. Perfect.

562
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.270
-- And the visitors probably will not so much complain about
-- that. Wait a

563
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:13.869
minute then

564
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.819
Andre has a two person office all for himself.

565
00:23:16.829 --> 00:23:19.030
-- No,
-- no, we'll put a visitor place in there

566
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.199
if you don't mind.

567
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.229
Well, there is this full time person arriving ini I think it's really important to,

568
00:23:25.239 --> 00:23:25.930
to plan with that.

569
00:23:25.939 --> 00:23:27.300
-- But
-- what's, what's your na me again?

570
00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:27.550
And

571
00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:29.099
I think it's Paula

572
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.689
-- um would it be
-- possible to have Paula in your

573
00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:33.219
office?

574
00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.489
-- Yeah. Could
-- be

575
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.489
cause that's,

576
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.569
that's something that we we should be deciding either

577
00:23:39.579 --> 00:23:41.369
you want to keep me in your office,

578
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.170
which is alright.

579
00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.089
And then

580
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.579
somewhere I I think that that's not

581
00:23:46.989 --> 00:23:47.099
realistic

582
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:48.020
planning

583
00:23:48.589 --> 00:23:48.750
goes

584
00:23:48.959 --> 00:23:49.489
back to and

585
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.250
ok, we'll put Paula and the visitor here.

586
00:23:57.729 --> 00:23:59.540
So Paola is the new person

587
00:24:01.349 --> 00:24:02.689
and the visitor.

588
00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:05.030
Uh this is that this one

589
00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:06.410
and then we'll,

590
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.810
we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here with two

591
00:24:12.109 --> 00:24:12.540
pumps.

592
00:24:13.329 --> 00:24:15.349
Sorry, it's not very nice. But

593
00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:20.510
does this display better?

594
00:24:25.619 --> 00:24:26.089
Um

595
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.349
Well, no, but Paula being new, I, I think he

596
00:24:29.959 --> 00:24:31.229
put her with somebody else.

597
00:24:33.969 --> 00:24:37.910
Well, the, the lunch cannot be shared with two people. I mean,

598
00:24:38.449 --> 00:24:40.089
you cannot go there and discuss and,

599
00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.550
and two people working there in the room.

600
00:24:42.729 --> 00:24:44.930
-- Yeah.
-- No, but we said that we won't discuss

601
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.719
or maybe if we organise some kind of, you know, coffee a t the end of the day or,

602
00:24:49.729 --> 00:24:52.520
or drink, then the two people will stop working.

603
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.270
I don't know. Maybe they won't be happy.

604
00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.930
Okay, then Martin, let, let me put you in that office and I'll put

605
00:24:58.069 --> 00:24:58.719
Paola with me

606
00:24:59.859 --> 00:24:59.880
or.

607
00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.890
So Martin goes where

608
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.010
Martin stays.

609
00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:08.000
You don't want to separate Maria and

610
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:08.280
Yalina.

611
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.300
Yeah, that's true.

612
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.060
Okay. So let's put Maria

613
00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:15.839
in the separate office

614
00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:20.719
and we have, yeah, and we have two visitors and a master student and a,

615
00:25:20.729 --> 00:25:22.339
and a part time person

616
00:25:23.229 --> 00:25:25.880
bi I was thinking the other way around.

617
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:27.640
Oh, sorry,

618
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.780
with Maria

619
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.199
in the two people room

620
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:33.579
and to have

621
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:34.359
vis one V

622
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:34.869
two,

623
00:25:35.069 --> 00:25:37.109
-- Yalina and David in the three people
-- room.

624
00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.160
So, who is with Maria here?

625
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.270
Okay.

626
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.800
Yeah. And no visitor.

627
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:43.160
No,

628
00:25:43.329 --> 00:25:44.390
-- that's
-- a two people room.

629
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:44.719
So,

630
00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:49.599
yeah, but that means that this room, the middle one would be quite empty.

631
00:25:49.819 --> 00:25:54.280
All the, I mean, two visitors and the 50% pers person. I don't think it's very uh

632
00:25:54.689 --> 00:25:55.599
reasonable.

633
00:26:00.189 --> 00:26:01.859
Yeah, but let's split them a little bit.

634
00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:04.569
-- So that when there a re no visitors, a t least people A R
-- E

635
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.630
no, the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied too.

636
00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:08.300
Yeah, I think

637
00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:10.199
we might uh lose rumor two.

638
00:26:11.329 --> 00:26:13.939
So this goes, here goes, visitor two

639
00:26:14.979 --> 00:26:15.040
para.

640
00:26:15.349 --> 00:26:17.479
There, here goes visitor one.

641
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:20.489
And is this better?

642
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.930
Except that we cannot read it. But

643
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.660
apart from this,

644
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.260
it's a little bit crowded in the

645
00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.060
cause you have,

646
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.660
well, not yet, of course, because

647
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.560
Paula is not, has not arrived.

648
00:26:37.569 --> 00:26:41.270
But uh starting from January, you will have two full time person.

649
00:26:42.489 --> 00:26:42.520
Okay,

650
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:43.359
let

651
00:26:43.459 --> 00:26:43.479
me

652
00:26:43.689 --> 00:26:44.199
call this

653
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.780
visitor one

654
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:50.260
which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come.

655
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.859
And this visitor too, which means it's like a, well,

656
00:26:54.069 --> 00:26:54.540
you know,

657
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.660
2nd

658
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.140
2nd chance.

659
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.089
But why couldn't we

660
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.599
basically

661
00:27:05.589 --> 00:27:10.050
move you, David in this two people room with Maria?

662
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.729
Well, we

663
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.800
-- could what
-- would the

664
00:27:13.329 --> 00:27:13.849
one half,

665
00:27:13.969 --> 00:27:15.500
uh, half time person?

666
00:27:18.349 --> 00:27:19.439
And you have Paula

667
00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:24.469
Yarina, one visitor position. And I still keep hope that, uh, Marian NCOS at

668
00:27:24.729 --> 00:27:27.050
the lounge will on the, on, on the,

669
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:29.010
on the long term

670
00:27:29.479 --> 00:27:30.819
disappear because anyhow,

671
00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:32.810
I don't believe there can be a lounge where in

672
00:27:32.819 --> 00:27:34.859
a place where there a re already two people working.

673
00:27:34.869 --> 00:27:37.689
So the lounge will just die after some point and

674
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.150
it's quite a long room.

675
00:27:40.479 --> 00:27:42.099
It has two doors.

676
00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:43.439
Oh,

677
00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:44.790
yeah, it has two doors. Yeah,

678
00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.099
very good.

679
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.510
Yeah. So maybe in the long run we'll get the wall.

680
00:27:49.339 --> 00:27:50.280
Okay. That's true.

681
00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:53.800
-- Okay.
-- Then, then there would be, although there a re three windows. But, um,

682
00:27:54.459 --> 00:27:55.020
okay.

683
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:59.439
So why would we move David to Maria do with Maria? Do you have any preferences, David,

684
00:27:59.719 --> 00:27:59.890
uh,

685
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.739
-- mixing pe, uh, men and
-- women?

686
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.199
So, well, he already is

687
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.030
and

688
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.160
the, the two visitors will be in one room.

689
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.599
But that, that's fine because maybe there a re not two visitors a t the Sa me time.

690
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.369
Yeah, I wouldn't put the two visitors in the SA me room because when there is no one,

691
00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.760
it makes a big hole and when there a re two people.

692
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:20.449
So it makes

693
00:28:20.689 --> 00:28:22.160
too many variations.

694
00:28:22.349 --> 00:28:25.050
-- But, yeah, but then,
-- then you can, you can move, for instance,

695
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.810
if you move David to, uh, with Maria.

696
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:29.500
Mhm.

697
00:28:29.609 --> 00:28:30.180
Then,

698
00:28:32.369 --> 00:28:34.000
yeah, the occupancy is better that way.

699
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.290
I think you prefer that.

700
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.050
I

701
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:36.489
think

702
00:28:37.069 --> 00:28:37.760
it's more

703
00:28:38.219 --> 00:28:38.969
it's stable

704
00:28:39.979 --> 00:28:41.560
because visitors stay and go.

705
00:28:48.989 --> 00:28:49.609
Oops.

706
00:28:49.819 --> 00:28:50.449
Sorry.

707
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.380
Uh,

708
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.229
what did we say here? This

709
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:54.619
one?

710
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.329
Yeah, that's my, uh,

711
00:28:58.229 --> 00:28:59.800
to me that's the best we can do

712
00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:01.579
if you,

713
00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.089
if we realistically can plan to have a lounge.

714
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.000
Well, I think that was really decided and it's, it's no way.

715
00:29:10.099 --> 00:29:13.339
No, because actually if we do a proposal without a launch

716
00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:14.859
and, you know,

717
00:29:15.339 --> 00:29:16.500
the other group will

718
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.239
the message. Yeah, exactly.

719
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.660
And that means that all the constraints that we set and uh

720
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.890
all the other things just www will just basically disappear.

721
00:29:27.199 --> 00:29:29.810
Uh Which means we've worked for nothing.

722
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:30.780
Okay.

723
00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:31.579
Uh

724
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.880
What's, what's wrong with this?

725
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.239
So who has strong,

726
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.819
strong opposition to that?

727
00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.500
Uh I don't,

728
00:29:42.709 --> 00:29:43.079
oh,

729
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.939
you have to go, Susan. Okay.

730
00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.199
-- But
-- do you have any?

731
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.469
Yeah. Well, we're almost done, Susan. But uh w

732
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.949
we'll, we'll just check the, the items.

733
00:29:52.349 --> 00:29:53.400
Yeah, please. Okay.

734
00:29:53.829 --> 00:29:54.000
No

735
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:54.380
problem.

736
00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:56.760
Yeah, we,

737
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.560
we'll just review the items to see if we okay look a t

738
00:29:59.569 --> 00:30:02.719
all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final.

739
00:30:02.729 --> 00:30:02.880
Uh

740
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:03.880
yes or no.

741
00:30:04.189 --> 00:30:07.709
-- Um I think we,
-- we, we accommodated most of the constraints

742
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.260
cause uh we a re sure that Maggie and Bruno,

743
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.319
uh Maggie is happy with having Bruno in her office and p

744
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.959
is happy to have uh Mariana.

745
00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:16.530
Yeah, I think that's okay. We

746
00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:17.099
check,

747
00:30:17.479 --> 00:30:18.089
we check

748
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:18.579
and

749
00:30:18.689 --> 00:30:18.729
Yes,

750
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.550
Nancy, no reason to think that they should be

751
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.920
a possible situation.

752
00:30:24.949 --> 00:30:27.790
Me thing for Marian and Marian F and Nicos.

753
00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:34.380
Uh Paula, we don't know yet because she didn't arrive yet. And uh, well,

754
00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:35.050
Yalina a

755
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.359
that means that for a, for a short time,

756
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.310
-- Yalina will be just alone in a three person
-- room.

757
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:41.689
That's a

758
00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.780
bit. Yeah, that was the point in letting David there and,

759
00:30:44.979 --> 00:30:46.540
but okay, maybe we'll

760
00:30:46.729 --> 00:30:47.050
just

761
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.890
it as an option, David or visitor one or,

762
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.569
-- but
-- then, then we, we could just for the sake of having a

763
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.640
defendable solution.

764
00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.839
Uh As long as Paula is not, has not arrived, is to

765
00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:04.119
switch for the proposal, Paula and David.

766
00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:05.569
Mmh,

767
00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:10.099
but we, we really plan that as soon as

768
00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:11.930
Paola is here or even earlier.

769
00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.479
Okay. So we'll know that

770
00:31:13.599 --> 00:31:13.760
we,

771
00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:16.750
that the region actually around here

772
00:31:16.959 --> 00:31:18.949
is probably just movable

773
00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:19.540
either.

774
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.290
Yeah, we can switch this, this,

775
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.050
-- this is dangerous
-- to propose.

776
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:24.280
I

777
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.839
mean, you have a three p, three person room with

778
00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:30.369
one master student in it.

779
00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:33.699
Yeah. No, exactly. Yeah, that I wouldn't, I wouldn't propose

780
00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:34.020
that.

781
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:38.979
That's why I always try to put the separate the visitors just to balance a little bit.

782
00:31:38.989 --> 00:31:41.209
But okay, we'll uh we'll be open on, on that as

783
00:31:41.319 --> 00:31:41.449
soon as

784
00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.560
is here.

785
00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:43.650
Yeah,

786
00:31:45.229 --> 00:31:46.199
and we will have this.

787
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.739
Well, it depends also on, well, if

788
00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:51.130
Yalina stays longer or not, which is

789
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.689
not yet very clear. But um,

790
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:55.709
ok,

791
00:31:55.839 --> 00:31:57.189
we'll see anyway, we,

792
00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.150
we'll be open. When, when

793
00:31:58.449 --> 00:31:58.579
is she

794
00:31:58.699 --> 00:31:59.459
supposed to finish?

795
00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:04.770
I don't really know I think our master thesis is probably due to. Um,

796
00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:07.959
no, I would say, yeah, maybe June next year. A

797
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:09.290
t the latest. Yeah,

798
00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:14.369
-- actually, I don't know when, when
-- do we, when do you, when do we uh where,

799
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.839
when a re we supposed to sub

800
00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:17.229
submit the proposal?

801
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.979
Well, we, we won't have any extra meeting,

802
00:32:21.329 --> 00:32:25.160
you know, the four of us. So, yeah, this one has to, to be the, the final one.

803
00:32:25.849 --> 00:32:26.520
Um

804
00:32:26.689 --> 00:32:29.430
So, um well, we'll have actually,

805
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.109
I, I'll present this

806
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:32.579
to well with the other,

807
00:32:32.589 --> 00:32:36.180
I'll compare it with the other one and uh try to make a decision actually,

808
00:32:36.189 --> 00:32:39.420
I think it's even uh a bit later or two days or

809
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.000
something

810
00:32:40.109 --> 00:32:45.020
like that. So as soon as we have, Susan, we can uh we can um so I would, I would switch

811
00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:46.380
-- again
-- again,

812
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.020
okay.

813
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.979
But that, as I say, it's just for the shape of the,

814
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.010
of the proposition. So I even um even ready to uh

815
00:32:54.459 --> 00:32:57.800
to internally say that David will actually be in this room.

816
00:32:58.359 --> 00:33:02.209
-- Yeah, w we can leave it like this and then
-- change. Uh There a re na mes on the doors.

817
00:33:03.219 --> 00:33:04.869
Uh Yeah, there will be NA mes on the

818
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.000
cause. Susan, the, the, the, the problem,

819
00:33:08.339 --> 00:33:12.800
the, let's say the tech, not the technical, the psy psychological problem we have is

820
00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.040
I'm pre I'm extremely happy with that solution.

821
00:33:16.729 --> 00:33:21.310
It will be a worker working solution starting from January when Paula will be here.

822
00:33:21.319 --> 00:33:23.349
But currently, if we present it as it is,

823
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:27.109
we have a three person room that is only occupied by a master student.

824
00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:31.430
No, because there's another person right now a student that I just,

825
00:33:31.569 --> 00:33:32.589
uh, um, hired

826
00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.020
-- and she's just working right now
-- for

827
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:38.239
that.

828
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:38.520
A

829
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.170
real, real,

830
00:33:39.609 --> 00:33:41.930
-- she's a real visitor. She's a real visitor.
-- That

831
00:33:43.189 --> 00:33:43.339
contract

832
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.459
for her for two

833
00:33:44.599 --> 00:33:44.709
months.

834
00:33:45.719 --> 00:33:46.949
So then we would have, okay.

835
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:47.969
Okay.

836
00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.180
Yeah, we'll, we'll keep it like this.

837
00:33:50.709 --> 00:33:51.359
Um,

838
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.020
okay. I, well, I'll try to, to express all these constraints and uh,

839
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.050
and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually a re sort of uh, well,

840
00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:05.060
s things could be changed over there,

841
00:34:05.239 --> 00:34:05.750
but

842
00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:07.069
-- on some other
-- side, I have

843
00:34:07.339 --> 00:34:10.820
to say that, that, that uh unit has to, has to have some.

844
00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:12.699
Yeah, the visitor space. Yeah,

845
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.938
-- it's,
-- it's,

846
00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.179
it's extremely important in the research domain that

847
00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:19.389
-- we can have people coming to visit
-- us.

848
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:20.699
That's

849
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.938
-- the second
-- point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it,

850
00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.600
you should uh, circulate it uh, over mail to all the, all the con

851
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.820
involved people.

852
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:32.938
Well, to double check.

853
00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.370
-- So that I
-- think this, I'm not very sure,

854
00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:37.649
but I think this will be done after the meeting.

855
00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.810
I went before.

856
00:34:39.958 --> 00:34:44.120
Okay, if you, if you spend time defending a thing and then um I dunno anus

857
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:45.320
comes to you or Pierre

858
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.228
comes to you saying no, I don't want to be with Marian,

859
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:54.208
as far as I know, I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal. So. Okay.

860
00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:55.389
Yeah, I'll circulate this

861
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:56.590
-- cost
-- anything. It's just

862
00:34:57.949 --> 00:35:01.770
great. I have a view on the mountain and I'm with the person I like. So I'm happy.

863
00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:05.350
Okay. So maybe we'll learn some more constraints.

864
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:10.389
-- Um What's
-- the timeline on this now? So, you have a meeting?

865
00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:10.669
Um

866
00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.979
Yeah, actually, as I, as I told, uh, Martin,

867
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:19.870
um, well, this is the last time we meet. So, uh this is well, more or less our proposal

868
00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.149
and uh we'll have a meeting. I think it's, it's in two days or something like that

869
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.560
uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh

870
00:35:27.929 --> 00:35:29.580
well, make a final decision, actually,

871
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:33.250
-- probably a pre final one since we'll have to check again with
-- everyone.

872
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.820
It's not, it's not completely, it's an important issue because uh I need to know

873
00:35:36.949 --> 00:35:37.620
when

874
00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:42.909
I will have the office decided the phone number decided

875
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.969
because these a re information that I have to provide to the EPFL administration,

876
00:35:46.979 --> 00:35:48.790
I'm reachable when I'm a T.

877
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.719
Uh Well, they can phone me on the mobile, but uh

878
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:53.489
I would definitely prefer to have

879
00:35:54.379 --> 00:35:58.060
a clean field administrative form that I can

880
00:35:58.449 --> 00:35:59.010
give back.

881
00:35:59.459 --> 00:36:03.659
Well, so actually I think I, I'm not very sure, but

882
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:05.639
the most important thing is, well,

883
00:36:05.649 --> 00:36:11.159
finding out when we will move and this happens in probably, I think next month or

884
00:36:11.459 --> 00:36:13.110
depends also on how

885
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.110
Well, the, uh, the furnishing and, uh,

886
00:36:16.729 --> 00:36:17.000
of course

887
00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:17.330
you have

888
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.459
issues. How about internet connections?

889
00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:23.969
-- Well, uh, network connections, I mean, how many connections
-- a re there?

890
00:36:23.989 --> 00:36:26.219
-- Yeah,
-- because that's also something that we had double check.

891
00:36:26.229 --> 00:36:30.139
-- You know, if you a rein a room with three people and one network. Oh, no,
-- no, no, no.

892
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:33.360
The, the, the building is very, no, actually I, I've seen it.

893
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.340
Uh, the building is very modern and, uh,

894
00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.020
you can have activated,

895
00:36:37.899 --> 00:36:42.850
we'll get them activated. A and I think you get a t least, yeah, three per room

896
00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:44.969
or

897
00:36:45.209 --> 00:36:45.229
for

898
00:36:45.379 --> 00:36:48.169
the more bigger rooms you get double for every workplace.

899
00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:48.840
-- You get two,
-- one, sometimes you

900
00:36:49.149 --> 00:36:49.209
need

901
00:36:49.429 --> 00:36:49.459
a

902
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:49.610
LA.

903
00:36:51.709 --> 00:36:53.870
Yeah, sometimes you need 22 computers

904
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.100
because

905
00:36:54.909 --> 00:36:54.959
people

906
00:36:55.129 --> 00:36:55.290
have,

907
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.229
-- they have a son and they have a, a PC.
-- So

908
00:36:58.429 --> 00:37:02.439
if you go back to the, uh, to the uh other sl slide where you have the furniture.

909
00:37:02.449 --> 00:37:05.060
So this, uh, we do, we have any m any,

910
00:37:05.129 --> 00:37:09.020
-- any word to say and so that I would like to have a red chair
-- or a blue

911
00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:13.239
desk. Oh, no. Unfortunately, that's decided by the, uh, the school.

912
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.739
So the, the chairs, a reb,

913
00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:19.139
the, the desk is, uh, is brown, well, light brown.

914
00:37:19.199 --> 00:37:21.820
-- But do
-- we have to order something or is it done automatically?

915
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:24.129
So it will be in the office when we move in?

916
00:37:24.199 --> 00:37:28.350
-- Uh,
-- normally it's done automatically except that we'll have to

917
00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:28.899
think

918
00:37:29.129 --> 00:37:30.949
places that we want to have.

919
00:37:31.489 --> 00:37:35.340
Yeah. Uh, well, these a re dictated by the na mes,

920
00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:38.120
uh, it's probably more difficult for the lounge.

921
00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:43.320
What we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring all the,

922
00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:46.520
well, the old, it's not old because we, we just bought it.

923
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.280
But, uh,

924
00:37:47.489 --> 00:37:51.040
all the furniture from the previous lounge will, will bring it here.

925
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.280
How about the boxes?

926
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:53.199
Because a TEPFL,

927
00:37:53.209 --> 00:37:55.090
you have to say when you will be moving the

928
00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.699
boxes so that you have uh people for moving them.

929
00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.729
Well, here you're supposed to move them yourself or?

930
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:01.610
Well,

931
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.810
-- it's the faculty that will take care of
-- uh receive some information about that.

932
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:05.929
Yeah.

933
00:38:06.239 --> 00:38:08.110
Yeah, I think usa, yeah,

934
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:12.449
I, I mean, it's a completely different issue from uh you know, arranging people.

935
00:38:12.459 --> 00:38:15.330
It's just uh how the moving will take place and there a re all things to,

936
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.169
to take care of.

937
00:38:16.179 --> 00:38:19.050
But uh it's uh quite unrelated with these things.

938
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.810
Yeah, we'll get, uh we'll get all the information

939
00:38:22.409 --> 00:38:26.030
uh thinking about internet connections. I think it's quite okay for the,

940
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.639
the f the, the printer to be there.

941
00:38:28.919 --> 00:38:35.209
Yeah, I think it's i it's feasible. We'll, we'll check. So the, the violet box here is

942
00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:39.870
-- uh uh a re mail boxes also, by the
-- way, uh uh is there any wireless connection,

943
00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:42.389
uh antennas for getting?

944
00:38:42.594 --> 00:38:42.614
Yeah.

945
00:38:43.534 --> 00:38:43.754
Not,

946
00:38:45.804 --> 00:38:47.915
not, not in the building for the moment

947
00:38:48.435 --> 00:38:48.465
there

948
00:38:48.604 --> 00:38:48.625
is

949
00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:48.875
down

950
00:38:49.945 --> 00:38:50.044
and

951
00:38:50.215 --> 00:38:50.264
pretty

952
00:38:50.395 --> 00:38:50.514
soon

953
00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.195
-- the whole building
-- will be covered.

954
00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:53.104
I mean,

955
00:38:53.584 --> 00:38:54.735
for the laptops it's,

956
00:38:55.274 --> 00:38:57.455
yeah, but right now downstairs it's fine.

957
00:38:57.705 --> 00:38:59.975
Some people can pick it up on the sixth floor,

958
00:38:59.985 --> 00:39:02.175
but pretty soon the whole building will be covered.

959
00:39:03.169 --> 00:39:06.100
Okay. Well, I think it's a bit off topic already.

960
00:39:06.429 --> 00:39:09.179
So, um, let's say that I, it's a proposal.

961
00:39:09.189 --> 00:39:14.030
We'll try, I'm, well, I'll try to, to express the, the constraints and, uh,

962
00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.639
your opinions and, um,

963
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.179
well, I think finally everyone can veto

964
00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.500
something if there is a huge problem.

965
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.219
But I think with this, we, we don't run into huge problems.

966
00:39:24.229 --> 00:39:25.699
The four of us will not veto.

967
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:26.219
Yeah,

968
00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:27.149
obviously

969
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.219
a t least. So, let me save this.

970
00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:33.270
Thank you for spending all this time.

971
00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:35.040
Ok.

972
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:36.290
Ok. You're all happy.

973
00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:43.889
Just

974
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.129
gonna

975
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.360
push

976
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:44.610
on

977
00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:44.959
here.
