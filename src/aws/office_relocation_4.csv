1,spk_1,0.13233333333333333,0.15548333333333333,"No, mines the opposite."
2,spk_0,0.16416666666666666,1.29565,"Um Okay. So um lets start. Um Thanks for coming again to this meeting. I hope it wont be too long and especially that will make some progress on uh this uh this small task that is putting people in our new rooms. Uh I hope you had fun in uh well, designing something or uh asking the people about their preferences and uh things like this. So yeah, thats what I was talking about. Its for womens shirts. Um So um well, I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings. I think youll be more and more used to it as, as soon as we move. So we have these one person, two person and three person rooms. Um And so that makes I think 18 places and we had about 15 people and some uh spare uh spare, well working places to to put um may I first uh provide the answers to the, the questions from the last time?  And I also
 checked with uh Maggie and"
3,spk_1,1.3071666666666666,1.3203333333333334,"Oh, great."
4,spk_0,1.3215,2.6745,"Yeah, so that will be part of the, your uh your solution or suggestions, the solution. But regarding the constraints, um there is no immediate plan to, to make separations between the rooms. So that means basically what we have to do with this setting. And uh its, its quite difficult to make new doors and new walls. So I think we shouldnt count on them in the next uh four years maybe. And they dont want us to sh, I mean, they dont want to provide an extra working space for Gisela with the other a, the admins which we could understand because its sort of full over there. But uh a t least thats what they said. So it seems we, uh, yeah, they, well, we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us though. It wouldnt be a bad thing maybe. But, um, well see so regarding the possibility to put four people in one of the 23 person rooms. Um, well, its not very easy. Well have to play uh quite uh quite wisely with the furnishing it. It looks like its not impossible. A t least on the one that is a bit uh longer on, on the right. So, uh the one here, it should be possible to put four persons. If we could avoid it, it would much simplify things. But uh my"
5,spk_2,2.6823333333333332,2.7625,"question is, is it, is it  against the regulation, security regulation?
 No,"
6,spk_0,2.7709833333333336,2.7811500000000002," no,
 no."
7,spk_1,2.789816666666667,2.8613166666666667,"And I, and I went over and I looked a t that room too. Theres plenty of space for four people."
8,spk_0,2.8708333333333336,3.15665,"Yeah, I think, yeah, its more a matter of how to arrange the furniture. But uh, since we a re experts, a t this task, uh okay. So maybe we could count on, on four places, but the final decision is not really ours. So, um,  well see actually that would be
 fine if this one of the person is 50%."
9,spk_3,3.1598166666666665,3.1693333333333333,So for exa
10,spk_0,3.1711666666666667,3.48815,"m exactly or one of the intern positions, the people who might come something like that. Um Okay, so these were the um the answers. So actually I, I did my uh my proposal as a slide. Would you like me to start or would you like me to end it?"
11,spk_1,3.5166666666666666,3.91865,"Complete? Uh I talked both with Maggie and Pierre and both of them were happy to share offices. They have no problem with some. Uh theyre, theyre easy but uh could be uh as Pierre has right now that she could, shes happy to continue to share with Marian and Maggie for example, to share with uh it could be with Bruno because they work on the Swiss  together and they like to gossip together. So,
 yeah."
12,spk_0,3.949,5.819333333333333,"Okay. Then let me um explain very briefly, the, the rationale for, for this. So its the sa me uh schema that, you know, in red you have the uh uh oh excuse me. Thats quite uh annoying. Excuse me. Um Hello. Oh, yeah. Um Can, can I call you a bit later in about half an hour? Im just in the middle of a meeting and Im talking. Oh, okay. Thank you. Bye bye. Um Sorry for this. Fortunately we were just uh the four of us. Um Okay, so let me get back to, to the proposal after a brief interruption. Um So the NA Mes A rein red now. Um well, one of the reasons a t least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects because I, I think that sometimes they, they just discuss together and uh its easier if theyre in the SA ME office and um which is quite happy. Actually, I, I also thought that some professors might enjoy or a t least uh dont, dont say anything about being with their assistant. So I was happy to hear Susan um saying that Maggie and Bruno could go on well together and Pierrette and uh Marian Inin the Sa Me office. Um So what I can say is uh that I also understood that Susan would be rather in favour of uh well having her own office. So uh its, its, its working like this. I put the lounge in the middle. Its also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows. So I think thats not a problem because youre not going to just stay there and stare outside. Uh But its, its nicer to have a nicer view from your office. I guess"
13,spk_2,5.823816666666667,5.866666666666667,putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge.
14,spk_0,5.880333333333334,5.9586500000000004,"I dont know. Yeah. Maybe I thought in an angle but thats obviously not very,"
15,spk_2,5.96865,6.018833333333333,"you a re printing all the time.  Yeah. Why
 not put the printer out in the"
16,spk_1,6.020833333333333,6.098166666666667," hallway? Okay.
 And so next to the photocopy, maybe it wouldnt be a bad place here."
17,spk_0,6.102483333333334,7.346316666666667," Is there
 any space there for photocopy and printer? Yeah, well have to check the, yeah, but the printer is quite small. If we find, find just a small table for it. M maybe, maybe one day well have a photocopy that is also a printer. So okay. But I, I wouldnt s well insist on this, I think. Okay. So the printer will, will remove it if we work from this uh this solution. So um im two is more or less in the upper left side. Um I said more or less um uh upper uh lower left side uh you have Swiss and Parmenides. So the two projects from the list and then me SLT on the on the right side, maybe not a ve a very good solution for G if you can suggest something uh better because shes with two people who uh well, two phd students and its true that she has, yeah, a lot of phone calls to make. But um its some way to, to solve some constraints. I think this is a very open thing. Uh If you want, we can use this document or we could just say first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using"
18,spk_1,7.358816666666667,7.437166666666666,question. Whats the justification for giving Nancy her own office?
19,spk_0,7.453483333333334,7.800483333333333,"Um Yeah, maybe not a very strong one. And I, maybe you a re you have better suggestions. Um It was, I think, sort of one of the uh places they re that remain. And I, I think, yeah, there is no strong constraint and uh well, shes a smoker but the policy is that we dont smoke. So its even better if shes uh with a second person, I"
20,spk_2,7.8046500000000005,7.865483333333334,have a suggestion to put Gisela to switch Nancy and Gisela.
21,spk_0,7.879833333333333,7.944,"Uh huh. Ok. A the facts on the printing machine,"
22,spk_2,7.957333333333334,7.99315,"the printer in the one person room,"
23,spk_1,8.018833333333333,8.131333333333334,Gisela will not be very happy about that. Uh We tried that and Gisela really didnt like to have the printer and people in and out.
24,spk_0,8.19665,8.243483333333334,"Yeah, that was the case. And uh she was a bit, uh"
25,spk_2,8.289483333333333,8.365833333333333,an admin room clearly identified as an admin room and only an admin room.
26,spk_0,8.373666666666667,8.42,We could store files there where you can close
27,spk_2,8.422316666666667,8.499316666666667,"it. You have the personal files of the, of the people of the, of the, of the unit,  et cetera,
 et cetera."
28,spk_0,8.504483333333333,8.599333333333334,"Okay. So if you want, I can already do  this change
 here against the fact that my personal files,"
29,spk_2,8.599483333333334,8.6585,a reinafinain a room that is not specifically dedicated for that.
30,spk_0,8.7015,8.702166666666667,The
31,spk_3,8.712833333333334,8.940483333333333,"professors, uh, you have, theres no printer or theres only one printer. Um, because if not the person, the printer can go in a room of three people. Thats typical case where theres the lab and theres, the printer is there."
32,spk_2,8.95615,9.04565,"Yeah. But the printer can be in the, in the,  yeah,
 the, yeah, when the printer is, yeah, its, its the main one."
33,spk_0,9.045833333333333,9.52165,"We have a secondary one which we could try to accommodate in another room. But its basically, yeah, the pe the, the printer where everybody prints. Um, so I changed this. So maybe I would suggest let me le c can I hear also? Let, let us hear from you and then if we can work out the solu common solution from this one, then we go back to, to this slide and if not, um, well just, Ill start from scratch"
34,spk_2,9.537666666666667,9.592833333333333,"right to share the room with you is a view on the old town, lets say."
35,spk_0,9.618166666666667,9.621483333333334,Mmhmm.
36,spk_2,9.63615,9.776983333333334,Okay. You have to be aware of what I was saying last time that you will have to suffer some calls suffer from p from phone calls.
37,spk_0,9.781816666666666,9.94865,"Yeah, Ill try, Ill bring my walk. And uh, David, you had also. Uh"
38,spk_3,9.958833333333333,10.42865,"Yeah. Okay for me as, uh, I dont know, uh, the people a lot. Uh I, I just suggested that uh theres a la a lack of men, so I would certainly put, uh, not two men in the sa me office. I would try to share them with the woman. So uh for exa Mples, I would uh in your slide, I would uh switch either you or Martin with uh uh the other room. This one"
39,spk_0,10.442833333333333,10.586316666666667,"uh huh oh Let me put the plan. Sorry, I will display um Yeah, this is the empty one. I dont want to influence you. So, so you would put,"
40,spk_1,10.590316666666666,10.642316666666666,you have to show us which one you were talking about? David? We didnt know.
41,spk_3,10.65615,10.69565," Yeah. Yeah, I was wanting to change this.
 Uh"
42,spk_1,10.72065,10.759983333333333," You c you can even stand and just show us
 there."
43,spk_3,10.772,10.843316666666666," Yeah, but I need your uh your slide because I was talking about your
 slide."
44,spk_0,10.845316666666667,11.021166666666666,"Okay. So you would prefer the na Mes, okay? I I dont want to influence you too much but uh Im perfectly happy to start with this as a basis and then change things."
45,spk_3,11.069316666666667,11.268,"Yeah. So here you can see that the men is, I mean they a re always sharing the room with a, with a woman. I mean, theres Bruno Me uh be and Nico is"
46,spk_2,11.274000000000001,11.366,"also. Yeah, but for Pierrette and, and Maggie its uh its will, its a wish or its"
47,spk_0,11.369166666666667,11.476166666666666,uh oh actually is a woman too. Sorry. Its the feminine of Pierre. Mmhmm.
48,spk_3,11.487666666666666,11.588483333333333,So I mean this is perfectly fine and we just changed Martin and Andre for Maria or Yalena or Nancy. Maybe
49,spk_2,11.61115,11.65715,you didnt get your solution. What was it again?
50,spk_3,11.660983333333334,11.8825,"Yeah. Here there a re two men. So, so, I mean, its a mix sexes. Yeah, its nice. I dont think so. I mean, theres a lack of men here ininin this Inin, this lab. So I would change one, each one."
51,spk_2,11.902983333333333,12.351983333333333,"But its not so much a question of men or women. Its more the question of, as I said that uh um here you have only p, you have phd students that a re regroup there, you have s senior researchers that a re regrouped, which is to me more unless it corresponds to some specific demand. Like it is in the case, in Maggie, in Maggies case, in Pierres case, I think thats a very efficient way of doing things."
52,spk_0,12.371166666666667,12.822166666666666,"Yeah. And for me, its also, I, I would prefer maybe not to be in a three person office just to be. So Im very happy with you propose this, but I could also be happy with most of the other people. So even in a three person room, its, its fine. Okay. So lets keep in mind maybe this uh constraint of balancing the, the genders. Uh Well see if we can uh do something for it."
53,spk_1,12.841833333333334,12.887666666666666,"Andre, did you ask these people if this was okay with them?"
54,spk_0,12.893166666666668,13.768483333333334,"Uh Ive asked some of them and Ive also used a little bit uh what Ive, well, I mean, the, the present arrangement just not to, to shock people too much. And its also people that I know um, get on well, quite, quite well together and also work on the SA me project, like, for instance, Marian, uh, uh, the Finnish Marianne and, uh, Nikos who interact quite a lot on, uh, on me. SLT. Um, yeah, Maria and Yalena seem to go on one quite, quite well. Uh, Nancy had no strong preference, especially since shes no longer allowed to smoke in, in her office. Um, yeah. So I, I think, well, a t least as far as I, I asked, there was no major objection  but
 isnt there just a, uh, a question of proximities you put David"
55,spk_2,13.771166666666666,14.001816666666667,"with and yes. Um, but isnt ANAs working, um, in a, in a more substantial way in, uh, with people, like, uh, either Maria or Yalina?"
56,spk_0,14.038,14.247166666666667,"Um, yeah, thats true. Thats true. I, um, c so we could put Nancy with David and, uh, put Agnes also working with."
57,spk_1,14.255983333333333,14.258833333333333,"So,"
58,spk_3,14.272816666666667,14.367833333333333,"but we agree that its not important to, to share the room with someone  that has the SA me
 project here,"
59,spk_2,14.370316666666668,14.425,"the other constraints, a re, uh, satisfied somehow. So."
60,spk_3,14.43615,14.54365,"Mmhmm. And more, and I will be quite happy to have the, the full room some 50% of the time."
61,spk_0,14.567166666666667,14.6595,"Yeah, thats a small advantage. And, uh, I, its a bit more, uh, more comfortable actually."
62,spk_2,14.66965,14.963666666666667,"Uh, but I mean, with, with the three, the 23 person rooms, I think that they can mix them the way they want. I mean, if they prefer to be, uh, Maria, uh, Yalina Nikos and, uh, Nancy and Marian on the other side. Well, no, thats not completely equivalent because Nancy, all a re phd students, a re master students. But Nancy. Correct."
63,spk_1,15.010666666666667,15.377983333333333,"Yeah. But that doesnt matter. Thats not important. The one question I was wondering about though, because three is always, uh, well, the more people in office, the less ideal that wouldnt, it maybe be better to put David in since hes only half time. So that way, then  theres not three people all the time.
 So I would switch David and Nancy typically."
64,spk_0,15.407983333333334,15.47765," Yeah, probably that
 they should be in this room. Could be in the other one for me."
65,spk_2,15.477816666666667,15.678333333333333,"The 23 people rooms a re really, they have to be reshuffled according to people personal preferences. So I definitely with  Agnes in the two person
 room,"
66,spk_0,15.6875,15.781666666666666,"they, they have worked together on par. So this makes some sense. Um"
67,spk_2,15.789,15.86865,"But again, its also a question of personal preference. I mean, you, you cant be IR or the person you dont want to be."
68,spk_0,15.879816666666667,15.9615,"Yeah. As far as I know, I think its probably quite a good, uh  uh good
 man"
69,spk_3,15.96765,16.0015,that you going to finish the phd or
70,spk_1,16.020483333333335,16.0825,"uh no.  Uh
 first one should be Maria"
71,spk_0,16.089483333333334,16.160316666666667,but 1.5. Okay. Lets see. You do it this way
72,spk_2,16.170483333333333,16.422,"that in the 23 people room there will be one that is not so overloaded because of David because David will be part time and the other one not so overloaded because there is a one free position.  Uh, knowing that this one free position, uh, will not stay free very
 long."
73,spk_1,16.429333333333332,16.553816666666666,"No, because dont forget we already have somebody coming in. Uh, January. Yes. At least one person."
74,spk_2,16.566666666666666,16.73515,"This is still a worry for me because we a re still, we dont, still, still dont have enough space for the visitors. At least we put them in the lounge."
75,spk_0,16.747816666666665,16.773333333333333,"Yeah. Yeah, I, I,"
76,spk_2,16.811833333333333,16.816,yeah.
77,spk_0,16.84665,17.514133333333334,"Yeah.  So
 we have a t least three visitors positions, positions. Okay. So, since were supposed to do a final proposal, sorry. Uh, let me move the printer, um, uh, next to the photocopier. Okay. And well find some way to, um, well, attach it to a wall or something like this so that we keep it. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Um, okay. So thats the, uh, mm, I, I dont think we can put visitors in the lounge. Its, uh, it depends on how we think about the lounge if its thought as being a reading group."
78,spk_2,17.514316666666666,18.331833333333332,"No, if its thought as the que, that, thats really a very important question to me. Do we, do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our, in our offices or in our, uh, workplace, we can read newspapers elsewhere. And I really do think its more important for lab to be able to decently, uh, welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers, newspapers. You can read them home, you know, you can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else. You can go on the balcony if its, if its in the summer. So, I, I dont understand why we, why we should put priority on lounges. If we, if we dont have enough space for accommodating visitors, thats just not, not to my priorities.  How
 would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices, like in,"
79,spk_0,18.3355,18.528983333333333,"well, Inin one of the one person offices, I, I know they a re actually quite uh quite demanded. So, um I, I think Susan youre very happy with this solution. So lets book"
80,spk_2,18.557166666666667,18.5925,in with three visitors.
81,spk_3,18.636,18.65315,One person room. Is it
82,spk_0,18.6565,18.711,"really, its probably too small. It doesnt work"
83,spk_2,18.730816666666666,18.839666666666666,"to just remove the lounge. We, its a luxury for us. We dont have space for a lounge. Lets lets be, lets"
84,spk_0,18.846983333333334,18.851983333333333,be a
85,spk_2,18.858666666666668,19.129933333333334,"tat the A T the A T the in front of your colleagues in saying, IW if I have to choose between a reading my newspaper and this c and having a, a decently welcomed uh uh research visitor, I prefer read my newspapers. Thats just not just not realistic,  but we a re
 researchers."
86,spk_0,19.1301,19.3701,"The problem is it, it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we, we need the lounge.  So I, I think its simply not. No, no I
 dont think we can choose about.  No, actually, I, I, Im sorry, its, uh, you
 have the three people"
87,spk_2,19.37325,19.703866666666666,"that split it in two parts as, as Susan was, was, uh, proposing last time with a, who was a wall and you have a lounge there and we can read your newspapers and we have a full two room, two person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors and a t least we have some, uh, free margin for the next two years or"
88,spk_0,19.7077,19.759016666666668,so. So how do we split the room?
89,spk_1,19.775,20.037316666666666,"We put the furniture that we got for our reading room, we put it into the other half of the three person room. Would that fit a little divider of some kind?  But
 what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge,"
90,spk_2,20.039483333333333,20.092,"supposed to have a discussion in the lounge? They, a re supposed to read their newspapers."
91,spk_0,20.1125,20.175833333333333,"Well, not the newspapers because no scientific articles."
92,spk_2,20.201316666666667,20.28665,"No, thats not the goal. The goal of the launch was, was a place where you can relax,"
93,spk_1,20.311983333333334,20.363166666666668,"but  also to read articles. A t least
 you can do it in your office."
94,spk_0,20.38265,20.508333333333333,"So you would like to put it. Yeah, with an, and then who,  who
 you have good chairs to read newspapers that you dont want to break your heart?"
95,spk_2,20.5085,20.5505,"Your, uh, your, your, your back ways in your office?"
96,spk_0,20.555816666666665,20.809,"Yeah. Okay. But then that means that well put the lounge on the right side, uh, here and, uh, here well put two places for visitors. 33, but that means the office will be a t least for the moment empty.  That looks very
 bad"
97,spk_2,20.812833333333334,20.85965,"visitor that is arriving. Uh, what  did
 you say? A"
98,spk_1,20.87015,20.994,"visitor? Its a new person  arriving in
 January. Okay. So that could take the, the free place over there."
99,spk_0,21.001816666666667,21.007316666666668,"Uh, I mean,"
100,spk_1,21.021,21.021333333333335,"the,"
101,spk_2,21.04531666666667,21.140983333333335,"that could take 11 position in the, in the, in the, in this place."
102,spk_0,21.156333333333333,21.318833333333334,"Yeah, I think. Okay. So we need what, two free positions and one new person arriving X or something like that."
103,spk_2,21.326,21.769333333333332,"Well, thats an idea. If you forget about the lounge, what you could do is to move either Maria Maria or Yalina in the, in the what is currently the lounge? That means that we have one person there with one free position. We have one free position in the, in the room that Maria Yarina is coming from and one free position over there. So we have three position distributed over the rooms. But we can, I"
104,spk_0,21.771983333333335,22.198,"mean, where is the lounge? No lounge? Okay. No way I will, Ill have my head cut off if we dont have a lounge.  So of the
 lounge and you put it in the corridor. No, no, no, no, lets do the lounge corner. The lounge is in the freezer. Okay. A t least, I mean, otherwise I cannot really defend it because it, it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every,  every decision we
 went to get the budget for it. Yeah, I think so."
105,spk_2,22.203,22.3235,"Yeah, I will explain to your visitor. Ok. But unfortunately they have a position in the toilet because  there is a reading room where
 people have to."
106,spk_0,22.323666666666668,22.713333333333335,"Well, lets have the visitors first. Okay. So what we need is a new and two freeze. So I think we can put what Maria or Yalena, I dont want to separate them really. But uh or my cell, I dont like that office actually. Um So I was thinking to put here,"
107,spk_2,22.7215,22.775333333333332,"it could be Nikos for instance,  could put, you can, can
 switch."
108,spk_1,22.779833333333332,22.876,"No, were not gonna keep Marian in its three first place. Uh just having it, Marian in the lounge. Yeah."
109,spk_0,22.887833333333333,23.078483333333335,"Yeah. No, we, yeah, so its either, yeah, we could put a visitor with you Martin but its probably okay. Lets try one le lets try this. Uh lets try Maria here. I"
110,spk_2,23.08265,23.115333333333332,"mean, and  oh, do
 you? You dont mind?"
111,spk_0,23.122483333333335,23.165," Okay? Cause I
 will be there a half time. Perfect."
112,spk_2,23.167333333333332,23.221166666666665," And the visitors probably will not so much complain about
 that. Wait a"
113,spk_1,23.225,23.317166666666665,"minute then Andre has a two person office all for himself.  No,
 no, well put a visitor place in there"
114,spk_0,23.336,23.353316666666668,if you dont mind.
115,spk_2,23.363333333333333,23.455,"Well, there is this full time person arriving ini I think its really important to, to plan with that.  But
 whats, whats your na me again?"
116,spk_0,23.45531666666667,23.60815,"And I think its Paula  um would it be
 possible to have Paula in your office?  Yeah. Could
 be"
117,spk_2,23.615,23.800333333333334,"cause thats, thats something that we we should be deciding either you want to keep me in your office, which is alright. And then somewhere I I think that thats not realistic planning"
118,spk_1,23.809816666666666,23.824816666666667,goes back to and
119,spk_0,23.846333333333334,24.341833333333334,"ok, well put Paula and the visitor here. So Paola is the new person and the visitor. Uh this is that this one and then well, well still have probably some way to put a second visitor here with two pumps. Sorry, its not very nice. But does this display better?"
120,spk_1,24.426983333333332,24.520483333333335,"Um Well, no, but Paula being new, I, I think he put her with somebody else."
121,spk_3,24.56615,24.748833333333334,"Well, the, the lunch cannot be shared with two people. I mean, you cannot go there and discuss and, and two people working there in the room.  Yeah.
 No, but we said that we wont discuss"
122,spk_0,24.752833333333335,24.978650000000002,"or maybe if we organise some kind of, you know, coffee a t the end of the day or, or drink, then the two people will stop working. I dont know. Maybe they wont be happy. Okay, then Martin, let, let me put you in that office and Ill put Paola with me"
123,spk_1,24.99765,24.998,or.
124,spk_0,25.035666666666668,25.0835,So Martin goes where Martin stays.
125,spk_2,25.098983333333333,25.138,You dont want to separate Maria and Yalina.
126,spk_0,25.1905,25.263983333333332,"Yeah, thats true. Okay. So lets put Maria in the separate office"
127,spk_2,25.28865,25.431333333333335,"and we have, yeah, and we have two visitors and a master student and a, and a part time person bi I was thinking the other way around."
128,spk_0,25.450833333333332,25.46066666666667,"Oh, sorry,"
129,spk_2,25.47533333333333,25.618483333333334,"with Maria in the two people room and to have vis one V two,  Yalina and David in the three people
 room."
130,spk_0,25.62615,25.739833333333333,"So, who is with Maria here? Okay. Yeah. And no visitor. No,  thats
 a two people room."
131,spk_2,25.74,25.745316666666668,"So,"
132,spk_0,25.757,26.07615,"yeah, but that means that this room, the middle one would be quite empty. All the, I mean, two visitors and the 50% pers person. I dont think its very uh reasonable. Yeah, but lets split them a little bit.  So that when there a re no visitors, a t least people A R
 E"
133,spk_1,26.0815,26.169983333333334,"no, the rooms have to look like theyre sort of occupied too. Yeah, I think we might uh lose rumor two."
134,spk_0,26.188816666666668,26.444333333333333,"So this goes, here goes, visitor two para. There, here goes visitor one. And is this better? Except that we cannot read it. But apart from this,"
135,spk_2,26.488166666666668,26.687833333333334,"its a little bit crowded in the cause you have, well, not yet, of course, because Paula is not, has not arrived. But uh starting from January, you will have two full time person."
136,spk_0,26.70815,26.952333333333332,"Okay, let me call this visitor one which implies that uh it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come. And this visitor too, which means its like a, well, you know, 2nd 2nd chance."
137,spk_2,27.015,27.1675,"But why couldnt we basically move you, David in this two people room with Maria?"
138,spk_0,27.1905,27.213333333333335,"Well, we  could what
 would the"
139,spk_2,27.22215,27.62815,"one half, uh, half time person? And you have Paula Yarina, one visitor position. And I still keep hope that, uh, Marian NCOS at the lounge will on the, on, on the, on the long term disappear because anyhow, I dont believe there can be a lounge where in a place where there a re already two people working. So the lounge will just die after some point and"
140,spk_1,27.646333333333335,27.70165,its quite a long room. It has two doors.
141,spk_0,27.723666666666666,27.8085,"Oh, yeah, it has two doors. Yeah, very good. Yeah. So maybe in the long run well get the wall."
142,spk_2,27.822316666666666,27.89666666666667,"Okay. Thats true.  Okay.
 Then, then there would be, although there a re three windows. But, um,"
143,spk_0,27.90765,27.998166666666666,"okay. So why would we move David to Maria do with Maria? Do you have any preferences, David, uh,"
144,spk_2,28.017333333333333,28.04565," mixing pe, uh, men and
 women?"
145,spk_0,28.048666666666666,28.069983333333333,"So, well, he already is"
146,spk_3,28.1,28.289483333333333,"and the, the two visitors will be in one room. But that, thats fine because maybe there a re not two visitors a t the Sa me time. Yeah, I wouldnt put the two visitors in the SA me room because when there is no one,"
147,spk_0,28.289666666666665,28.4175,"it makes a big hole and when there a re two people. So it makes too many variations.  But, yeah, but then,
 then you can, you can move, for instance,"
148,spk_2,28.429166666666667,28.503,"if you move David to, uh, with Maria. Mhm. Then,"
149,spk_1,28.539483333333333,28.566666666666666,"yeah, the occupancy is better that way."
150,spk_0,28.573333333333334,28.588166666666666,I think you prefer that.
151,spk_2,28.600666666666665,28.692666666666668,I think its more its stable because visitors stay and go.
152,spk_0,28.816483333333334,28.955483333333333,"Oops. Sorry. Uh, what did we say here? This one? Yeah, thats my, uh,"
153,spk_2,28.970483333333334,29.084816666666665,"to me thats the best we can do if you, if we realistically can plan to have a lounge."
154,spk_0,29.098666666666666,29.581333333333333,"Well, I think that was really decided and its, its no way. No, because actually if we do a proposal without a launch and, you know, the other group will the message. Yeah, exactly. And that means that all the constraints that we set and uh all the other things just www will just basically disappear. Uh Which means weve worked for nothing. Okay. Uh Whats, whats wrong with this?"
155,spk_2,29.600666666666665,29.66365,"So who has strong, strong opposition to that?"
156,spk_0,29.688333333333333,29.9,"Uh I dont, oh, you have to go, Susan. Okay.  But
 do you have any? Yeah. Well, were almost done, Susan. But uh w well, well just check the, the items. Yeah, please. Okay. No"
157,spk_2,29.904666666666667,29.946,"problem. Yeah, we,"
158,spk_0,29.946166666666667,30.12848333333333,"well just review the items to see if we okay look a t all the constraints and then youll be able to say the final. Uh yes or no.  Um I think we,
 we, we accommodated most of the constraints"
159,spk_2,30.135666666666665,30.249316666666665,"cause uh we a re sure that Maggie and Bruno, uh Maggie is happy with having Bruno in her office and p is happy to have uh Mariana."
160,spk_0,30.25815,30.301483333333334,"Yeah, I think thats okay. We check, we check"
161,spk_2,30.309166666666666,30.359166666666667,"and Yes, Nancy, no reason to think that they should be"
162,spk_0,30.375166666666665,30.398666666666667,a possible situation.
163,spk_2,30.415816666666668,30.671833333333332,"Me thing for Marian and Marian F and Nicos. Uh Paula, we dont know yet because she didnt arrive yet. And uh, well, Yalina a that means that for a, for a short time,  Yalina will be just alone in a three person
 room."
164,spk_0,30.69,30.89281666666667,"Thats a bit. Yeah, that was the point in letting David there and, but okay, maybe well just it as an option, David or visitor one or,  but
 then, then we, we could just for the sake of having a"
165,spk_2,30.900166666666667,31.198833333333333,"defendable solution. Uh As long as Paula is not, has not arrived, is to switch for the proposal, Paula and David. Mmh, but we, we really plan that as soon as Paola is here or even earlier."
166,spk_0,31.204666666666668,31.400833333333335,"Okay. So well know that we, that the region actually around here is probably just movable either. Yeah, we can switch this, this,  this is dangerous
 to propose."
167,spk_2,31.4045,31.50615,"I mean, you have a three p, three person room with one master student in it."
168,spk_0,31.51865,31.969166666666666,"Yeah. No, exactly. Yeah, that I wouldnt, I wouldnt propose that. Thats why I always try to put the separate the visitors just to balance a little bit. But okay, well uh well be open on, on that as soon as is here. Yeah, and we will have this. Well, it depends also on, well, if Yalina stays longer or not, which is not yet very clear. But um, ok, well see anyway, we, well be open. When, when"
169,spk_2,31.97415,32.0795,"is she supposed to finish? I dont really know I think our master thesis is probably due to. Um,"
170,spk_0,32.084983333333334,32.23948333333333,"no, I would say, yeah, maybe June next year. A t the latest. Yeah,  actually, I dont know when, when
 do we, when do you, when do we uh where,"
171,spk_2,32.239666666666665,32.28715,when a re we supposed to sub submit the proposal?
172,spk_0,32.30433333333333,32.657,"Well, we, we wont have any extra meeting, you know, the four of us. So, yeah, this one has to, to be the, the final one. Um So, um well, well have actually, I, Ill present this to well with the other, Ill compare it with the other one and uh try to make a decision actually, I think its even uh a bit later or two days or"
173,spk_2,32.66466666666667,32.773,"something like that. So as soon as we have, Susan, we can uh we can um so I would, I would switch  again
 again,"
174,spk_0,32.7755,32.78366666666667,okay.
175,spk_2,32.78633333333333,32.96333333333333,"But that, as I say, its just for the shape of the, of the proposition. So I even um even ready to uh to internally say that David will actually be in this room."
176,spk_0,32.97265,33.08115," Yeah, w we can leave it like this and then
 change. Uh There a re na mes on the doors. Uh Yeah, there will be NA mes on the"
177,spk_2,33.1045,33.451816666666666,"cause. Susan, the, the, the, the problem, the, lets say the tech, not the technical, the psy psychological problem we have is Im pre Im extremely happy with that solution. It will be a worker working solution starting from January when Paula will be here. But currently, if we present it as it is, we have a three person room that is only occupied by a master student."
178,spk_1,33.45948333333333,33.583666666666666,"No, because theres another person right now a student that I just, uh, um, hired  and shes just working right now
 for"
179,spk_2,33.635666666666665,33.652833333333334,"that. A real, real,"
180,spk_1,33.66015,33.74515," shes a real visitor. Shes a real visitor.
 That contract for her for two months."
181,spk_2,33.76198333333333,33.78248333333333,"So then we would have, okay."
182,spk_0,33.79383333333333,34.11781666666667,"Okay. Yeah, well, well keep it like this. Um, okay. I, well, Ill try to, to express all these constraints and uh, and say in particular that the two rooms over here actually a re sort of uh, well, s things could be changed over there, but  on some other
 side, I have"
183,spk_2,34.12231666666667,34.18033333333333,"to say that, that, that uh unit has to, has to have some."
184,spk_0,34.18731666666667,34.24896666666667,"Yeah, the visitor space. Yeah,  its,
 its,"
185,spk_2,34.24915,34.32315,"its extremely important in the research domain that  we can have people coming to visit
 us."
186,spk_0,34.33883333333333,34.39896666666667,"Thats  the second
 point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it,"
187,spk_2,34.40265,34.5895,"you should uh, circulate it uh, over mail to all the, all the con involved people. Well, to double check.  So that I
 think this, Im not very sure,"
188,spk_0,34.58965,34.64683333333333,but I think this will be done after the meeting. I went before.
189,spk_2,34.66596666666667,34.8038,"Okay, if you, if you spend time defending a thing and then um I dunno anus comes to you or Pierre comes to you saying no, I dont want to be with Marian,"
190,spk_0,34.81366666666667,34.94316666666667,"as far as I know, I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal. So. Okay. Yeah, Ill circulate this  cost
 anything. Its just"
191,spk_2,34.96581666666667,35.0295,great. I have a view on the mountain and Im with the person I like. So Im happy.
192,spk_0,35.038833333333336,35.55416666666667,"Okay. So maybe well learn some more constraints.  Um Whats
 the timeline on this now? So, you have a meeting? Um Yeah, actually, as I, as I told, uh, Martin, um, well, this is the last time we meet. So, uh this is well, more or less our proposal and uh well have a meeting. I think its, its in two days or something like that uh to discuss and compare with the other proposal and uh well, make a final decision, actually,  probably a pre final one since well have to check again with
 everyone."
193,spk_2,35.55433333333333,35.967666666666666,"Its not, its not completely, its an important issue because uh I need to know when I will have the office decided the phone number decided because these a re information that I have to provide to the EPFL administration, Im reachable when Im a T. Uh Well, they can phone me on the mobile, but uh I would definitely prefer to have a clean field administrative form that I can"
194,spk_0,35.97415,36.2685,"give back. Well, so actually I think I, Im not very sure, but the most important thing is, well, finding out when we will move and this happens in probably, I think next month or depends also on how Well, the, uh, the furnishing and, uh,"
195,spk_2,36.278816666666664,36.399483333333336,"of course you have issues. How about internet connections?  Well, uh, network connections, I mean, how many connections
 a re there?"
196,spk_1,36.399816666666666,36.43698333333333," Yeah,
 because thats also something that we had double check."
197,spk_2,36.43715,36.502316666666665," You know, if you a rein a room with three people and one network. Oh, no,
 no, no, no."
198,spk_0,36.50248333333333,36.714166666666664,"The, the, the building is very, no, actually I, Ive seen it. Uh, the building is very modern and, uh, you can have activated, well get them activated. A and I think you get a t least, yeah, three per room"
199,spk_1,36.747166666666665,36.814,"or for the more bigger rooms you get double for every workplace.  You get two,
 one, sometimes you"
200,spk_3,36.81915,36.82683333333333,need a LA.
201,spk_0,36.86181666666667,36.91598333333334,"Yeah, sometimes you need 22 computers because people"
202,spk_1,36.918816666666665,36.970483333333334,"have,  they have a son and they have a, a PC.
 So"
203,spk_2,36.973816666666664,37.150333333333336,"if you go back to the, uh, to the uh other sl slide where you have the furniture. So this, uh, we do, we have any m any,  any word to say and so that I would like to have a red chair
 or a blue"
204,spk_0,37.155166666666666,37.36366666666667,"desk. Oh, no. Unfortunately, thats decided by the, uh, the school. So the, the chairs, a reb, the, the desk is, uh, is brown, well, light brown.  But do
 we have to order something or is it done automatically?"
