00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:06.530
Mm

1
00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:07.079
mm. Mm.

2
00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:08.260
Ok.

3
00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:10.510
So as you guys know

4
00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:10.930
is

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.409
o is too small. Well, the building is too small for our group.

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.270
So we're moving to a new building.

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.170
Uh it's gonna be the building across the

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.950
street and we're actually moving in three weeks.

9
00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:22.329
But

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.829
the problem is that the administration wants to know who's going to be in what office

11
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.309
in the new building and where we're gon we're gonna put things like

12
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.040
the printer, the fax machine,

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.439
all the big equip ment

14
00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:37.770
and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people in equip ment

15
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.169
and they want to know where we're going to do all of this by November 2nd.

16
00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:45.549
So that means basically

17
00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:46.880
next Tuesday.

18
00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.229
And since we don't really have any other time, we have to make these decisions today,

19
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.470
what we're getting is nine rooms for a maximum of 18 people,

20
00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.580
which is okay cause there's only 15 of us

21
00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:00.889
and all the rooms have windows luckily.

22
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.229
So there's no fights about who gets a window and who doesn't.

23
00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.309
Um there's two views either of the old town or the

24
00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.150
mountains and the rooms of various sizes there's 23 people rooms,

25
00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:12.989
52 person rooms, which a re on the corners of the building.

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.930
So you actually get windows on two walls

27
00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:17.849
and 21 person rooms.

28
00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:20.910
That's pretty much what the building looks like.

29
00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:23.889
Um, and then you have the number of people per room,

30
00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:27.790
the courtyard, because we're on the sixth floor, you can actually go out to it,

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.750
but just means that the windows look out onto open space.

32
00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:34.319
Um You can see the bathrooms, the elevators, a

33
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.650
re sort of further down the hall,

34
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.050
the purple bar, a t the bottom

35
00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.970
sort of on the right is the mail boxes,

36
00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:44.650
all of the windows open.

37
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.199
You can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building.

38
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.360
And the equipment that we have to put somewhere a re like I said, the photocopier,

39
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.080
which is really big, a fax machine which is not so big

40
00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:59.809
and the printer, which is

41
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.760
relatively big.

42
00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:06.040
Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack,

43
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.080
no cupboards like we have in the current offices

44
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.350
and each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk.

45
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.190
So like the, the ones that we have now,

46
00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.750
um, a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small, I mean,

47
00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.979
they're about that tall

48
00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.710
and one sort of hanging shelf.

49
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.610
So we don't get the bookcases like we have now,

50
00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.990
but just one shelf that's attached to the wall

51
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.639
and the people that we have to place.

52
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.139
Uh you can see the list there

53
00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.529
along with

54
00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.089
their position and the project that they work on.

55
00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:42.929
And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organise people,

56
00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:44.949
whether we want to do it

57
00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.830
by rank or by project or,

58
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.199
I don't know, put all the phd students together, all the professors together,

59
00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:55.559
that sort of thing.

60
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.380
So the idea is that we come up with a plan,

61
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.880
there's another group

62
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.990
who's gonna be working on the same plan later this week.

63
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.369
And then

64
00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:08.729
Andre and I have to do presentations

65
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.160
for the university administrators

66
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.470
on the second.

67
00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:14.119
So

68
00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:17.740
I have to come up with a plan possibly if we have time, a presentation, a

69
00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.559
quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best.

70
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.679
OK.

71
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.550
All right.

72
00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:26.789
So

73
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.179
anyone have any ideas or

74
00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:33.350
I guess,

75
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:39.949
uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hole

76
00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.190
in terms of security stuff if we can?

77
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:48.149
-- I mean, my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hole.
-- Yeah. Um

78
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.770
I think it's, the security is sort of the sa me as it is in the current building.

79
00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.690
So as long as the things a re physically attached to the wall so they can't be removed,

80
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.869
then it should be OK to leave them in the hall.

81
00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.339
It's just a question of whether you're printing sensitive documents or

82
00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.309
whatever.

83
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.750
So we only get one printer for 15 people.

84
00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.800
Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer

85
00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:19.839
and then I think some of us have personal printers.

86
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.519
I think Susan has a personal printer.

87
00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:23.279
Gisella

88
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.880
has one. Maybe

89
00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.290
I

90
00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:26.920
can't remember who else.

91
00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:29.920
Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer

92
00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:33.239
in terms of equip ment. It's sort of the sa me thing as we have now.

93
00:04:37.579 --> 00:04:38.200
Um,

94
00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:44.670
so what I'd propose is that we sort

95
00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:48.399
of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics

96
00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:52.549
and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day

97
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.869
with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly

98
00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:57.609
where to put people.

99
00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:00.700
Does that work?

100
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.019
Oh, and on the map, the little

101
00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:03.899
half

102
00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.339
circular, well, quarter circles or doors,

103
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.579
which I'm assuming you figured out. But just in case

104
00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:13.619
and there's just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The,

105
00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:16.579
the three person room on the right. Yeah.

106
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.500
And do we need a room? Like a reading room?

107
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.420
Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that

108
00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:24.250
they wanted to have a reading room

109
00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:26.179
so

110
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.420
we should leave a space for that

111
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.640
and we can't because like I said,

112
00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:33.779
maximum 18 people in those rooms and there's only 15 of us

113
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.480
and I don't know if you noticed, but two of usa

114
00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:38.589
re only

115
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.230
here half the time.

116
00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:41.989
So Martin and David,

117
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.309
um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva.

118
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.489
So,

119
00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:50.559
I sort of keep that in mind,

120
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:51.570
I guess when

121
00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:54.290
you're doing the actual planning.

122
00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.790
Mhm.

123
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.269
The first split we can do is between administration and

124
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.510
researcher.

125
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.700
Yeah, I know.

126
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.589
It's completely different work so

127
00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:15.760
we can deal with administration and decide something for administration.

128
00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:16.190
And then,

129
00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:18.679
yeah,

130
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.239
but

131
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.019
Gisela is really the only

132
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.420
administrator, a t least deal with that particular situation

133
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.700
and then see

134
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.140
with the other because I was thinking uh

135
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.500
Gisela is quite, I mean,

136
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.220
Gil

137
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.380
Gisela s work is quite noisy because it's secretary.

138
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.929
So you get lots of phone call and stuff like that and she's always moving around.

139
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.660
So you won't share an office with

140
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.950
Gisela

141
00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:44.600
unless you a re 50% and not the 50%

142
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.540
Gisela is working.

143
00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.630
Yeah, which is another condition

144
00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:49.839
-- which
-- I don't know if we can assume that

145
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.230
-- there isn't going to be any overlap between
-- them.

146
00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.260
So I don't know, maybe we can decide that Jesus

147
00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:03.660
is

148
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.779
having

149
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:05.899
one of the

150
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.570
-- one person room. Yeah.
-- Iw, I would suggest that too. Yeah,

151
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.359
maybe.

152
00:07:11.769 --> 00:07:12.929
Yeah. Either that or

153
00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:15.200
maybe put her in a two person room

154
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.269
with the equip ment or

155
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.079
like with the, the photocopier or maybe not the photocopier but the printer.

156
00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:27.890
Yeah. But a t least the thing we know that

157
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.170
is gonna be alone

158
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.089
or with equip ment but

159
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.519
not with 100% staff,

160
00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:35.850
staff worker.

161
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.100
Okay. So th it's a one person room but we don't know how, how big they a re, or

162
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.239
it's hard to tell. I mean,

163
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.260
Gisela has this funny, uh,

164
00:07:45.609 --> 00:07:46.299
typing.

165
00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:48.029
Yeah,

166
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.049
the rooms aren't tiny if you look at the,

167
00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:56.429
so probably sh she should get the facts. Right.

168
00:07:57.859 --> 00:07:59.869
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense

169
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.549
to put the facts in there.

170
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.619
So,

171
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.039
and then I think the main

172
00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.900
discussion we should have is,

173
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.539
um, if we want to make group of,

174
00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.018
amongst the SA ME project or among the Sa Me

175
00:08:43.249 --> 00:08:44.028
title.

176
00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:45.400
Yeah.

177
00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:47.669
Yeah. Professor assistant or uh

178
00:08:48.469 --> 00:08:48.580
yeah,

179
00:08:49.409 --> 00:08:52.619
couple of professors and assistant or, or yeah,

180
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.250
that's more a conceptual question

181
00:08:59.719 --> 00:09:01.390
than a practical question.

182
00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:05.900
Well, the third option is just completely mix everyone up

183
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.780
which some people say is better sort of for group environment so that

184
00:09:09.789 --> 00:09:12.820
you're not stuck only with the people who working on your project,

185
00:09:13.409 --> 00:09:13.739
right?

186
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.659
So if you share an office with someone who's on a completely different project,

187
00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:18.260
you find out about that project,

188
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.619
but you also sort of interact with other people on a more regular basis.

189
00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:25.989
But still I find it's quite easy if you

190
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.020
a re with people who work in the SA Me project in the SA Me

191
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.309
room because you have the meetings or people come and ask you discuss things,

192
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.030
maybe

193
00:09:34.409 --> 00:09:35.739
I don't know if it's uh

194
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.640
for other people who start working in the SA Me project.

195
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.119
-- Yeah,
-- but we will have this reading room

196
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.070
which will it be dedicated for reading and

197
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.809
for studying or can we have meetings there?

198
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.369
Can we reserve it for meetings?

199
00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:50.010
That I

200
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.000
think it's not a question of reserving it because

201
00:09:53.114 --> 00:09:55.734
there's other rooms at the university that you can reserve for a meeting.

202
00:09:56.044 --> 00:09:58.794
But if it's empty then sure you can use it for a meeting.

203
00:09:58.804 --> 00:09:59.864
There's nothing wrong with that.

204
00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.664
But I think if someone's already reading in there, it's not fair

205
00:10:03.025 --> 00:10:05.815
to go and kick them out just because you want to have a meeting because,

206
00:10:06.174 --> 00:10:08.934
well, the problem is if you have to go across the building and

207
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.309
it adds some overhead every time you want to have some

208
00:10:12.419 --> 00:10:13.109
short

209
00:10:14.119 --> 00:10:16.719
meeting and discuss some issues

210
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.880
-- or maybe we shouldn't call
-- it.

211
00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:21.359
But if you're having a short meeting, you don't really

212
00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:25.099
make an appointment for it. You just kind of

213
00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:28.809
go to someone's office and go down for a coffee or whatever

214
00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:34.840
cause they're still the cafeterias that you can use for informal.

215
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.289
The other thing we should take into account is if you receive student or not

216
00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:41.989
because

217
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:42.890
yeah,

218
00:10:43.849 --> 00:10:46.669
Marian and I interact a lot with student and

219
00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:48.909
we have reception hours and stuff like that.

220
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.119
So it means

221
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.830
you get time where a lot of people come along and talk and

222
00:10:54.359 --> 00:10:55.950
so it's the other Marianne does too.

223
00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:58.500
Yeah. So maybe it's not really nice to have

224
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.270
to share an office with somebody like us

225
00:11:01.979 --> 00:11:03.830
having a lot of social life and

226
00:11:04.239 --> 00:11:07.210
well, but then you either share offices with each other

227
00:11:07.599 --> 00:11:10.619
which doesn't really solve the problem because chances are you're not

228
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.179
going to have office hours at the exact same time.

229
00:11:14.109 --> 00:11:15.299
So, you're still

230
00:11:15.419 --> 00:11:16.780
going to have,

231
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.599
like, unless you get individual offices,

232
00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:24.299
I don't know if there's an easy way to

233
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.820
find a solution for that

234
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.330
because even if each of you share with the professor, then

235
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.840
it's the same thing for the professor.

236
00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:37.070
Yeah.

237
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.419
But it is something to keep in mind

238
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.669
unless you end up sharing an office with someone

239
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.789
where your schedules completely don't overlap and then you can

240
00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:50.609
schedule office hours when the other person isn't there,

241
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.130
some people come in around 11 and some people come in around eight.

242
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.219
But that's something we can't

243
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.650
reasonably assume like that

244
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.210
make plans with that because

245
00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:04.090
no, but you sort of see people's patterns. I mean,

246
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.950
even if it's not always like that, I mean, if it's like that, you know, 80% of the time

247
00:12:10.669 --> 00:12:11.200
then,

248
00:12:13.619 --> 00:12:14.710
but you're right, we can't

249
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.770
make assumptions too much.

250
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.599
So people would like to see, um,

251
00:12:27.039 --> 00:12:32.479
the office organised by, uh, by, by rank like professors and students. And

252
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.559
I don't know,

253
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:35.739
I think,

254
00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:39.020
well, it's up to us

255
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.140
how

256
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.369
we do it.

257
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:43.859
I can see benefits of both.

258
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:46.030
But

259
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.580
one point I can say by experience it's really hard

260
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.109
to share an office with three people because it makes

261
00:12:53.229 --> 00:12:54.599
much more noise

262
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.109
than only being two in an office.

263
00:12:57.859 --> 00:12:59.059
Yeah. Plus the computers,

264
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.010
-- the
-- computers.

265
00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:03.770
-- So, and we all know what it's like to have five computers in your office.
-- Yeah.

266
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.340
So we might be,

267
00:13:06.659 --> 00:13:11.799
it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room

268
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:13.479
to be the reading room

269
00:13:14.289 --> 00:13:15.710
and not to be necessary

270
00:13:16.609 --> 00:13:18.549
a room with three people.

271
00:13:19.989 --> 00:13:22.830
-- Yeah.
-- But if there a re people coming in, I mean,

272
00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:26.109
we have these people working for two months

273
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.869
who comes in the summer time or something.

274
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.469
I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too.

275
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.140
So um

276
00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:35.669
yeah,

277
00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:39.909
that's a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room,

278
00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:41.510
it's quite, then

279
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.390
everyone has an office, right? Cause it's maximum 18.

280
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.669
So take away three spaces and you're down to your 15

281
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.150
and you're right. If we do have a stagger

282
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.820
or whoever comes in,

283
00:13:53.289 --> 00:13:54.179
then we have nowhere.

284
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.710
Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose.

285
00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:01.309
So the other solution is to say, OK,

286
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.159
we use a three person room but only with two person each time

287
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.479
and leave a spare space

288
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.359
for.

289
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.840
But avoiding

290
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:21.570
having three person full time in the SA me room could be a good idea, I think

291
00:14:21.919 --> 00:14:23.609
or again, find people who don't

292
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.979
work the SA me hours.

293
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:26.440
Yeah,

294
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.630
it doesn't completely solve the problem. But

295
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.659
so for the reading room, we will have a two person room.

296
00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.349
Yeah, I

297
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:38.700
think

298
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.940
everybody agrees on that. One person will be too small. Anyways.

299
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.900
How about, how about this room?

300
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.030
The bottom? Yeah, a t the bottom in the middle

301
00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:47.510
with,

302
00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:47.950
due

303
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.119
to the mountains? Yeah,

304
00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:53.210
-- it has three windows. So I think it's, uh,
-- 22. Well, which

305
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.330
w there's 32 person rooms,

306
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.200
the, the middle one

307
00:14:57.739 --> 00:14:59.200
-- that
-- has two windows. Yeah,

308
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:01.159
it's, which is fine.

309
00:15:01.369 --> 00:15:04.880
-- It's still a
-- big room. Big black stripe is the windows.

310
00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:08.000
One between the big,

311
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.669
ok,

312
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.330
I should have explained that.

313
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.820
But what about the, the other one which has only one windows,

314
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.650
but in the courtyard it may be more quiet.

315
00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:19.710
Yeah. But then you don't get a lot of light

316
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.710
for reading.

317
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.309
We have electricity. So

318
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.510
I hope. Really.

319
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.200
No, it's a question. I mean, it, it's quite noisy outside

320
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.659
with the streets and,

321
00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:36.489
yeah, on the sixth floor. I don't know.

322
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:37.770
Yeah,

323
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.109
I know. I like the idea of looking out over.

324
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.859
-- So it's a relaxing
-- room. Well, I mean, that, that's the whole point. Right.

325
00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:51.770
It's just somewhere to get out of your office and go and do something else for a while,

326
00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.289
whether you're reading or just kind of

327
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.289
staring off into space.

328
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.979
You can look outside of the window if you have a quick meeting there.

329
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.049
So, what

330
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:00.460
about

331
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.250
one of the room in the

332
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:01.530
car?

333
00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:04.679
So you have three windows. It's even better.

334
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.309
-- Yeah, we could do that. Why
-- not?

335
00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:09.109
But you have less wool to put shelves and

336
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.099
stuff like that

337
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:15.130
if you intend the reading room, being more a

338
00:16:15.359 --> 00:16:16.479
library or

339
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:20.450
we have some

340
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.440
shelves, like cabinet type shelves for the reading room,

341
00:16:23.789 --> 00:16:26.969
but it's not really intended to be a library. I mean, we have

342
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.429
an T library

343
00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:31.710
but

344
00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:36.950
the other idea is to take because right now we all have bookshelves.

345
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.280
So one idea might be to take sort of

346
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.500
the books that aren't frequently used by people, put them all into that room.

347
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.140
So it becomes sort of

348
00:16:46.469 --> 00:16:49.559
mini library but not like a library system library, just

349
00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:52.299
go and borrow your colleagues books.

350
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.450
So we all agree about this too.

351
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.530
This in rooms.

352
00:17:05.098 --> 00:17:05.838
Which one?

353
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:07.010
I?

354
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:07.969
No or not?

355
00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:08.319
No,

356
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:10.540
-- I think the middle
-- one,

357
00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:12.170
-- the middle
-- one. Yeah. Yeah,

358
00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.199
it's also sort of m central

359
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:18.050
to the layout so everyone sort of has more or less the sa me distance to

360
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.400
it's not that it makes that much of a difference but

361
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.160
why not?

362
00:17:26.749 --> 00:17:29.318
So we can exclude this one to make an office.

363
00:17:31.709 --> 00:17:33.339
So what I can do is

364
00:17:35.349 --> 00:17:37.329
or maybe right on the board. I dunno.

365
00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:37.910
Um

366
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:39.290
actually that's a good idea.

367
00:17:39.439 --> 00:17:40.969
Just put it up.

368
00:17:41.869 --> 00:17:43.410
So we have the map and

369
00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:50.209
so

370
00:17:56.219 --> 00:17:57.839
this really isn't to scale but

371
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.150
oh well

372
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.410
um

373
00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:08.859
that's really not to scale.

374
00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:10.699
Alright,

375
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:11.270
-- good
-- enough.

376
00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:14.540
Um so we've got

377
00:18:15.949 --> 00:18:17.229
an office there,

378
00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:25.660
there's

379
00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:30.660
two and 13. Yeah.

380
00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:31.290
Is that?

381
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.430
Yeah. Yeah. Oh

382
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.050
-- so ok,
-- so this is

383
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.310
that and this becomes the reading room, right?

384
00:18:41.719 --> 00:18:42.180
Ok.

385
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.130
Is that

386
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520
a?

387
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.760
Yes. Okay.

388
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.369
And then,

389
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.530
yeah, should we decide also the administration stuff?

390
00:19:05.739 --> 00:19:06.050
And

391
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.930
-- so we exclude the, the thing we a re quite sure. And then we discuss
-- there,

392
00:19:12.069 --> 00:19:14.199
I was thinking of maybe we should assign

393
00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:16.800
Gisela into this three person office

394
00:19:17.859 --> 00:19:18.530
because

395
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.010
we, we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes.

396
00:19:22.839 --> 00:19:23.579
Then we could have

397
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.020
Gisela and the 2 50% people sharing the three

398
00:19:28.229 --> 00:19:28.849
personal

399
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.579
that's really noisy to be in the sa me office

400
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.300
-- as the administration.
-- But if

401
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.979
-- Gisela works 50% and they work 50%.
-- Yeah.

402
00:19:35.989 --> 00:19:38.449
That just imply you expect people to come when

403
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:39.640
Gisela is not working

404
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.959
and that's not really fair if you,

405
00:19:42.609 --> 00:19:43.680
well, I mean, so we can put

406
00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:44.739
Gisela in the two

407
00:19:44.989 --> 00:19:45.979
people room

408
00:19:47.209 --> 00:19:49.150
which is near the mailbox.

409
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.219
Yeah. Yeah,

410
00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:56.739
-- we
-- could,

411
00:19:58.339 --> 00:19:59.040
I don't know.

412
00:19:59.939 --> 00:19:59.979
Ok,

413
00:20:01.119 --> 00:20:01.239
we

414
00:20:01.369 --> 00:20:03.199
could, I mean, I don't know how noisy she is.

415
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.089
It's

416
00:20:04.219 --> 00:20:04.260
just

417
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.439
a,

418
00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:07.719
you always have the phone ringing even if they have, even when she's

419
00:20:07.869 --> 00:20:07.900
not

420
00:20:08.189 --> 00:20:09.170
have her own printer.

421
00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:09.989
Yeah.

422
00:20:11.729 --> 00:20:11.869
Yeah.

423
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.550
But that's,

424
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.349
that's a good point from Nichols to say that she

425
00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:18.229
needs to be near the mailbox and the printer.

426
00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:18.910
And,

427
00:20:19.439 --> 00:20:20.439
well, if you put her inin

428
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:21.599
the

429
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:22.709
room here,

430
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.819
-- it's relatively close
-- except the door is not really

431
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.500
-- convenient for
-- her. Convenient.

432
00:20:30.729 --> 00:20:31.119
True.

433
00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:36.930
Yeah. But I think if, if the main,

434
00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:38.880
um,

435
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.170
how can I put that?

436
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.319
The, um,

437
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.979
if the main reason to put

438
00:20:50.369 --> 00:20:51.579
to, to choose g, the

439
00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:53.060
place is the

440
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.959
proximity of the mailbox.

441
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.900
It should be a two P people room and not a three people room.

442
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:01.430
Ok.

443
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.229
-- It's fine with me.
-- Otherwise we have one people room and

444
00:21:05.949 --> 00:21:08.599
I don't know how much the proximity to the mailbox matters

445
00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:10.979
because usually when she's here and she picks up the mail,

446
00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:12.689
she actually brings it to your office.

447
00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:15.180
It's more the A T administration that

448
00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:16.369
-- uses our
-- mailbox and

449
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.810
the place where we all pass. Kind of.

450
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.540
That's true

451
00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:31.510
because if we put the photography near the mailbox and

452
00:21:31.699 --> 00:21:34.829
it seems to be the only place where there is room for that.

453
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.949
Yeah, unless you put it into an office which is just an annoying,

454
00:21:38.959 --> 00:21:40.489
I think cause even if you put it into

455
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.329
Giselle's office, it's gonna be,

456
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:42.949
it's

457
00:21:43.089 --> 00:21:43.119
too

458
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.300
big

459
00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:43.800
and

460
00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:44.520
yeah.

461
00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:51.439
Okay. Maybe we should write this down.

462
00:21:51.449 --> 00:21:52.650
Do we agree that the,

463
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:56.449
that the photocopier and the network printer goes next to the mailboxes?

464
00:21:57.239 --> 00:21:57.520
Okay.

465
00:22:11.109 --> 00:22:12.569
And then we can

466
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.939
for the moment put

467
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.569
Gisela in this corner room

468
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:16.650
if you agree.

469
00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:17.729
I dunno

470
00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:23.589
-- A t the beginning, we said that we were gonna give her one of the one person
-- rooms.

471
00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:23.880
Yeah,

472
00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:27.150
but there were this option of putting the

473
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.520
line near the photography.

474
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.530
Yeah,

475
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.329
I mean she's sharing an office right now and uh

476
00:22:40.979 --> 00:22:44.359
has anybody heard of any complaints that she's too loud or

477
00:22:45.229 --> 00:22:45.949
I mean she's

478
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.170
not

479
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.640
sharing an office. I mean sh we put some

480
00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.300
ining

481
00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:55.739
-- office because there is a spare
-- room and

482
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.410
they're not really in a position to complain.

483
00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.479
That's quite, uh,

484
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.109
I mean, that's quite important to keep a spare room

485
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.650
in

486
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.699
G's Office

487
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.489
if we need more stuff. But

488
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.939
I wouldn't work in this

489
00:23:11.339 --> 00:23:11.790
office.

490
00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:14.819
I

491
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.959
think it's just a question of work conditions. Like if you're

492
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.209
stagger

493
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.359
and you're c only coming in for two months,

494
00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:23.979
then you can put up with it. But if you're there, you know, for exa M

495
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:24.310
the whole

496
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:24.699
year

497
00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.339
for EXA

498
00:23:25.479 --> 00:23:25.560
MP.

499
00:23:25.699 --> 00:23:29.449
And there is no room in the cupboards for any people except

500
00:23:29.689 --> 00:23:29.760
Gisela

501
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.810
because you got lots of papers

502
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.650
and files and stuff like that.

503
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.689
So it's really, she needs,

504
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.140
-- she needs space, space,
-- okay.

505
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.250
But we can uh

506
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.250
reserve. So if you reserve a two people room, we can

507
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:47.170
put the trainees.

508
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.599
Yeah.

509
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:48.920
And

510
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:49.410
then they

511
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.119
-- need to be
-- a rein the sa me room.

512
00:23:51.939 --> 00:23:52.760
Okay. So,

513
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.839
Gisela A T the South West office. Yeah.

514
00:23:55.479 --> 00:23:55.699
Yeah. The

515
00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:56.060
cor

516
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:02.829
it's

517
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.180
South West.

518
00:24:04.689 --> 00:24:06.189
I don't know if this, if this map is,

519
00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:09.170
well, South west, if that's north.

520
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:09.719
Okay.

521
00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:10.300
The map

522
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:10.579
is

523
00:24:10.709 --> 00:24:10.959
South

524
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.319
West for

525
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.520
us.

526
00:24:12.609 --> 00:24:13.050
No.

527
00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:16.359
Well, I'm assuming that's what you meant, right. That,

528
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.140
yeah, that,

529
00:24:17.369 --> 00:24:17.510
that,

530
00:24:17.869 --> 00:24:17.949
yeah,

531
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:18.359
that

532
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:18.560
South

533
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:19.489
East anyways

534
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:23.140
anyways

535
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.729
this office, right?

536
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.619
You know, because with mountain mountains and old

537
00:24:28.729 --> 00:24:29.849
town it's not. No, sorry.

538
00:24:30.329 --> 00:24:30.530
But

539
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.150
I'm very bad at orienting. Whereas North in Geneva, I always get it wrong.

540
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:38.119
But I just assumed Nicos was

541
00:24:38.709 --> 00:24:40.030
talking with orientation here.

542
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.339
Sunrise and sunshine is quite

543
00:24:42.489 --> 00:24:44.780
sunshine. Sunrise and sunset is quite a

544
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.349
good. Um,

545
00:24:49.349 --> 00:24:49.939
so wait,

546
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:50.540
do

547
00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:53.839
we face the old town now?

548
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.660
And we're facing

549
00:24:56.239 --> 00:24:56.500
north

550
00:24:56.819 --> 00:24:57.300
east,

551
00:24:57.439 --> 00:24:57.650
north

552
00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:58.800
east

553
00:24:59.689 --> 00:25:00.560
sunrise?

554
00:25:00.689 --> 00:25:01.199
Okay.

555
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.030
So

556
00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:06.579
this is

557
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.260
east,

558
00:25:07.729 --> 00:25:07.900
north

559
00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:08.579
east.

560
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.949
We, we have sun in the morning only.

561
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.400
Yeah,

562
00:25:17.209 --> 00:25:17.540
we have.

563
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.339
So it does mean

564
00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:23.979
that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the north east

565
00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:26.000
is the more sunny one. This

566
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:26.219
one,

567
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.579
let's say that

568
00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:30.619
three

569
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.650
-- people. It's
-- the one you have now you both.

570
00:25:36.939 --> 00:25:37.819
-- Well, there's a quite
-- a lot

571
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:38.319
of

572
00:25:38.609 --> 00:25:38.689
the

573
00:25:38.949 --> 00:25:39.800
sunset and

574
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:40.599
no,

575
00:25:42.439 --> 00:25:42.989
and it's really

576
00:25:43.189 --> 00:25:43.349
warm

577
00:25:43.449 --> 00:25:43.739
and

578
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.380
you get lots of sun during summer. Yeah.

579
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:51.540
Um by the way, is it 1/6 floor building or is there more?

580
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.579
-- Yeah, we're the top
-- floor. Okay.

581
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.780
So it's warm.

582
00:25:56.599 --> 00:25:59.589
Uh The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have.

583
00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:02.760
Now we're just getting more space this way because we couldn't

584
00:26:03.079 --> 00:26:06.229
move in the other building because it was occupied by the other departments.

585
00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.050
Ok, good. So,

586
00:26:19.609 --> 00:26:21.099
so how many

587
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.189
rooms

588
00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:24.439
and how many

589
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.660
-- places do we
-- have? So we have reserved now to

590
00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:30.239
-- why don't I
-- change it on here as well?

591
00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:34.530
So that's

592
00:26:34.979 --> 00:26:35.040
Gisela

593
00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:37.180
plus one

594
00:26:38.449 --> 00:26:38.800
place

595
00:26:38.949 --> 00:26:39.729
but really

596
00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:42.859
the last place to be used.

597
00:26:43.189 --> 00:26:44.780
Plus fax.

598
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:45.599
Yeah.

599
00:26:46.189 --> 00:26:46.229
Mmhm.

600
00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.040
And then this is

601
00:26:51.709 --> 00:26:52.650
the waiting room.

602
00:26:52.829 --> 00:26:53.280
Ok.

603
00:26:54.819 --> 00:26:55.339
Oops.

604
00:26:58.849 --> 00:26:59.719
Um

605
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.099
so that leaves us with what

606
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.780
14 places

607
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:08.689
which is

608
00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:10.959
14 people.

609
00:27:12.439 --> 00:27:12.750
No, for

610
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.180
14 because

611
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:16.079
Giselle's already

612
00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:17.469
got a room.

613
00:27:19.829 --> 00:27:20.750
So we a re Good.

614
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.209
Bless you. Excuse me?

615
00:27:28.739 --> 00:27:29.380
Ok.

616
00:27:29.689 --> 00:27:30.489
Um,

617
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.819
so, so I'm going to take

618
00:27:32.959 --> 00:27:34.060
Gisela off of

619
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.290
that list

620
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.550
as well. I'll put her in gray, I guess.

621
00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:50.880
Can we group people by their name?

622
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.520
So it's gonna be Marianne's.

623
00:27:57.339 --> 00:27:58.109
Is, is any,

624
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:02.869
is there anybody who's not happy with the current situation so we could try to just

625
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:04.699
keep the sa me

626
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.430
arrangement just on the new building? Yeah, that's,

627
00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.060
that's,

628
00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:09.150
that's,

629
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.930
that can be a good idea. But do do we

630
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.569
can we do that?

631
00:28:13.979 --> 00:28:14.979
Because there is

632
00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.010
no, we

633
00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:16.930
can't because

634
00:28:17.449 --> 00:28:17.650
we can't,

635
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.150
we have one extra, one person office and,

636
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.880
and 2323 person offices. Yeah.

637
00:28:24.099 --> 00:28:25.729
Plus we have the two people who

638
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.560
aren't there now.

639
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.619
Yeah.

640
00:28:28.949 --> 00:28:30.000
No, we have to put it somewhere.

641
00:28:32.859 --> 00:28:35.060
You can keep some of the people together, that a re

642
00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:36.920
together now but

643
00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:39.430
not everyone. Definitely.

644
00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:41.640
OK.

645
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.969
So let's start then top to bottom Maggie.

646
00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:48.890
Well,

647
00:28:49.099 --> 00:28:51.959
-- why
-- don't we take a break and go off and think about it

648
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.469
and then

649
00:28:54.089 --> 00:28:56.260
once we have more concrete ideas,

650
00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:57.020
okay,

651
00:28:57.369 --> 00:29:00.949
we can come back and finish it cause if we just sit here and discuss

652
00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:04.869
it's gonna take a long time and we're gonna start arguing and get cranky and

653
00:29:05.569 --> 00:29:06.109
OK,

654
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.410
so let's have a break. Save your fag.

655
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.270
You have XB.

656
00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:18.300
That's nice.

657
00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.229
Mm

658
00:29:21.089 --> 00:29:21.579
OK.

659
00:29:23.719 --> 00:29:24.839
So how long it's gonna?

660
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.729
Mhm.
