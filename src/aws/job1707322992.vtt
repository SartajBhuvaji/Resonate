00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:30.206

28
00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:32.456
And um we will get

29
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:36.372
just reminding you the purpose of the zoom today is really to give you

30
00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:40.251
an opportunity to learn more about these particular fields in the health sciences.

31
00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:41.611
All of this information,

32
00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.732
the video and the presentation will be posted as all the

33
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:48.022
others are on our website during out during the zoom.

34
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:51.692
As I've encouraged you already, please make sure that you have your video on.

35
00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:54.872
Just make sure that you don't see a red slash through there.

36
00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.662
And that will allow us to get to know you

37
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.592
just like if we have the opportunity to be in person

38
00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:02.061
in addition to that, um

39
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.980
just uh be sure that you are listening so that

40
00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.360
you have some great questions to share with us.

41
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.820
So um each of our speakers wanted the opportunity um to share a little bit about the

42
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.399
life of what they do, how they got into the profession um that they're in.

43
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.809
Um And if there's anything that they would change or

44
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.149
any advice that they could give you along the way.

45
00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.259
So as you, um we always do in our presentations, we share with you

46
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.500
um some national averages and regional averages.

47
00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.199
Um This one is a very broad average for scientists and

48
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.889
clinical researchers with the national average uh for the salary.

49
00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.100
The big piece on this slide is to note the growth in this area

50
00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.220
um of 11%. So that's always good to know

51
00:02:44.684 --> 00:02:46.345
and I'm sure both of our speakers will be

52
00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:49.854
talking about the schooling um that is required.

53
00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:53.945
Um In addition to that, we also will be hearing from our research assistant

54
00:02:54.214 --> 00:02:57.945
um who is a recent uh well, a graduate from Roy

55
00:02:58.354 --> 00:02:59.865
Ketchum, but she'll be talking about the,

56
00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:03.475
the extensive journey that she's been taking because it's a number

57
00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:05.684
of years of experience to get where she is right now.

58
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.199
Um

59
00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:12.119
In addition, we always talk about those um skills that each of the,

60
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.630
the health sciences look for.

61
00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.479
So you can take a look through this once the presentation

62
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.399
is posted and um our speakers can definitely uh listen,

63
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.850
you

64
00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.119
can listen for this as our speakers talk to you regarding the skills that they,

65
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.360
they feel are most important,

66
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.160
um particularly those listening skills

67
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.070
and then we will start by introducing it. So I make sure we're on the same page.

68
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.559
Um Doctor Alex Collison.

69
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.580
So again, if, if I went too quickly over these present uh slides,

70
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.589
you know that they will all be on the website.

71
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.240
So I'm pretty excited today to introduce to you, Doctor Alex Pool.

72
00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.369
And um

73
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.229
he has a very long title.

74
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.880
Um He is a child and adolescent psychiatrist and um works

75
00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.690
out of Mount Sinai in New York City through the icann um

76
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.789
Center

77
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.880
Fever Autism Institute. I think I messed the order of that up.

78
00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.940
So I apologize because I wasn't reading it. I was doing it from memory.

79
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.820
Um, but, uh, Doctor Alex, who I finally called, Doctor Alex, um, uh, but Doctor Phil

80
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.670
is gonna share with you, how did he get into this field?

81
00:04:20.678 --> 00:04:22.899
And, um, just some of the fabulous,

82
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.890
very interesting things that he gets to do in his role.

83
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.799
I'm gonna turn it over to you, Doctor Alex and thank you again for being here.

84
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.540
Thanks, Amy. It's really good to be here.

85
00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:36.429
Maybe orient me a little bit. Who am I speaking to? Exactly.

86
00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:39.839
I see some faces. I see a lot of grown up faces

87
00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.670
but who else is like, generally speaking on the call?

88
00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:45.559
You're muted,

89
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.390
you're muted.

90
00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.540
Maybe you, you're muted.

91
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.119
Sorry, I was, I thought I clicked it and then I didn't.

92
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.500
Um, so these are our students ranging from seventh grade through 12th grade.

93
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.700
So, um, and, and also our, we have our adults that are here from,

94
00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:06.600
from putting these together and Angela

95
00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.359
who is also a speaker. So,

96
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.869
-- um, and several students might be popping
-- on as

97
00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.579
well.

98
00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:13.739
Seventh grade to 12th grade. Ok.

99
00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:14.339
Yes.

100
00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:17.899
And so you're, you're interested in sort of my trajectory?

101
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.399
What got me started

102
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.079
some advice. Yeah. Ok.

103
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.820
-- Um, so
-- I,

104
00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:25.660
I'll definitely share your story that you shared

105
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.910
with me already about what your teacher had

106
00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.220
told

107
00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:29.279
-- you. Oh,
-- yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.619
So that, that's actually, that was the very beginning of it all.

109
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.859
Um, so I mean, first, I'm, I'm a, I'm a physician.

110
00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:38.010
I'm a psychiatrist and I specialize in child ana

111
00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.940
in psychiatry.

112
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.760
I think, um,

113
00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:42.040
you know, people always ask, you know,

114
00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:44.140
when did you first realize you wanted to be

115
00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:46.420
a child psychiatrist or a psychiatrist in general?

116
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.380
And, um,

117
00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:51.640
I guess the answer for me was really in eighth grade

118
00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:55.399
when a teacher of mine, this is like my very first mentor.

119
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.230
So that'll be, that'll be kind of my, my biggest piece of advice is to frankly grab a, a

120
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.690
mentor and somebody who's really invested in you and in your career.

121
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.950
So my, my English teacher who's also my homeroom teacher,

122
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.299
she gave me a book on Freud's interpretation of dreams. And she said, you know,

123
00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:13.649
I really think you'd be a great psychiatrist.

124
00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:17.380
It, you know, I hadn't spent even a moment

125
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.309
kind of considering what my career path would be

126
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.820
when I was in eighth grade.

127
00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:26.320
I was, you know, focused on my friends and trying to get by in school and

128
00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:30.250
I wasn't especially a good student. I was a decent student. But,

129
00:06:30.579 --> 00:06:34.880
um that was really kind of a shock. My, my best friend's father as it turns out

130
00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.600
was a psychiatrist

131
00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.420
and also kind of odd. And I thought, wow, does that mean that I'm odd? And is that like,

132
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.179
but,

133
00:06:42.429 --> 00:06:45.899
but, you know, it turns out you can be a psychiatrist and not be odd.

134
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.760
Um I don't think I was odd in the end. But

135
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.510
it really planted a very important seed

136
00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:56.630
and it then revisited itself when I applied to college. And I was asked again,

137
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.959
what would my major be? You know? And I thought, hm,

138
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.970
I guess if I wanna be a psychiatrist, I should probably

139
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.200
major in preme

140
00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.589
or do premedical classes.

141
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.910
So that's how I set out at the beginning of my college career.

142
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.519
I went to the University of Wisconsin.

143
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.230
And um I really had absolutely no concept of what was required in terms of

144
00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:18.649
effort to be successful on a pre

145
00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:19.970
med path.

146
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:22.989
And so very soon into my college career, I realized, gosh,

147
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I can't have fun in college and,

148
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.570
and enjoy myself and take other kinds of classes and also, you know,

149
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:30.859
survive pre-med.

150
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.679
So I switched tracks and II, I became a psychology major instead.

151
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:36.809
And then I thought to myself, wow.

152
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.130
And I was gonna the next kind of point or I had to figure things out.

153
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.200
I was, I was practically a junior or senior

154
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.209
in college. And, and um

155
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.959
I had to think about what's my next steps.

156
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.109
I thought while I was a psychology major, I might as well

157
00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.109
pursue

158
00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:51.679
a graduate degree in psychology to be,

159
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.519
to be a clinical psychologist because I had already skipped over

160
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:57.109
all these pre-med classes that are required for medical school.

161
00:07:57.899 --> 00:08:01.440
And I was sitting in interviews for first clinical psychology.

162
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.609
And I was asked the question, why do you want to be a clinical psychologist.

163
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.329
And it occurred to me in that moment, um, I,

164
00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:09.239
I really didn't want to be a clinical psychologist.

165
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.679
I wanted to be a psychiatrist and a physician

166
00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:12.579
and I, you know, and I,

167
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:14.239
and I tell these stories and these are actually very

168
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.010
true stories because I had no idea what I was doing

169
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:21.209
when I was in seventh grade or eighth grader, ninth grade or 10th grader.

170
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.320
Even when I was a senior in college, I had very little idea of what I was doing.

171
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.399
I had a sense of what my interests were.

172
00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.929
I had a sense of what I thought I'd be good at

173
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.519
more importantly.

174
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.640
And it just kind of gave this little um beacon of, of direction, but

175
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.039
it wasn't as um kind of thought out.

176
00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.150
I had an experience when I was a,

177
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.400
I think a freshman in college is a camp counselor

178
00:08:46.229 --> 00:08:48.460
where I was a counselor in um,

179
00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.409
a bump for kids with autism.

180
00:08:50.789 --> 00:08:53.969
And that really fascinated me and I planted another seed and I thought to myself, oh,

181
00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:54.450
wow.

182
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:54.919
So

183
00:08:55.289 --> 00:08:57.640
psychology psychiatry,

184
00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.880
maybe developmental disabilities. And that kind of

185
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.849
led me to this direction of working with Children

186
00:09:04.239 --> 00:09:06.919
in psychiatry and developmental disabilities. And then,

187
00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:10.450
and then you kind of get on a path and, and you decide, well,

188
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.630
if this is what I'm gonna do,

189
00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:13.859
here's what it looks like. So it looks like

190
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.309
you gotta finish college,

191
00:09:15.869 --> 00:09:19.179
you gotta go to medical school, then you gotta go to residency.

192
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.299
And if you wanna work with kids, you have to do a fellowship on top of your residency.

193
00:09:22.309 --> 00:09:24.309
So I did um four years of college

194
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.630
and then, because I wasn't pre-med, I, I did so terribly in my pre-med classes,

195
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.710
I had to go back

196
00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:33.150
for uh two years to collect all the pre-med

197
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.489
requirements, like chemistry and biology and physics. So

198
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.729
that's basically six years of college. Plus

199
00:09:39.849 --> 00:09:42.900
what's, what's called post back then. Four years of medical school.

200
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.099
So,

201
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.719
what is that? That's 10,

202
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.869
then three years of adult psychiatry residency and two years of,

203
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.659
of child psychiatry fellowship.

204
00:09:50.669 --> 00:09:52.719
So, my training was, was 15 years

205
00:09:53.619 --> 00:09:54.239
and

206
00:09:54.659 --> 00:09:55.159
I guess,

207
00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:58.849
you know, from, from the perspective of the seventh or 12th grader that,

208
00:09:58.859 --> 00:10:00.809
that feels like a very, very, very long time.

209
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.840
Um, but, but frankly, it's not

210
00:10:04.159 --> 00:10:06.729
because when you think about it, you know, you, you practice

211
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.559
or you work for,

212
00:10:09.049 --> 00:10:11.559
I don't know, I just, I just turned 50 last week.

213
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.130
What is that? I, I guess I, I finished when I was 30

214
00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:19.000
all my schooling. So I've already been practicing for 20 years

215
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.130
and,

216
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.929
you know, I only 50 you know, presumably I have another 25 years perhaps to go.

217
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.969
So 15 years wouldn't be invested in like a career that's gonna be

218
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.010
4550 years. It's probably worth it.

219
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.289
Um,

220
00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:36.760
I like to encourage people to go into medicine because I think that there's very,

221
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.599
very few careers out there where

222
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.500
you can have an impact on somebody every single day.

223
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.280
You can actually feel like, wow, your work is meaningful. You're helping people.

224
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.960
That's very gratifying.

225
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.719
I think it's, um,

226
00:10:49.469 --> 00:10:54.530
you know, when you invest so much time and energy and, and frankly money into a path,

227
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.510
it, um, it feels like the investment really pays off.

228
00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:00.349
I,

229
00:11:01.349 --> 00:11:04.349
I think that psychiatry in particular is fascinating.

230
00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:06.710
I think it's a really kind of developing field. I think

231
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.200
people who are interested in how the mind works.

232
00:11:09.619 --> 00:11:10.380
Um

233
00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:14.000
It never gets boring. There's always really fascinating stories.

234
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.929
There's always really

235
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.609
amazing experiences working with families,

236
00:11:18.299 --> 00:11:21.309
there's always new things to learn, so you're constantly being challenged.

237
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.309
Um So III I think, you know, in that sense,

238
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.270
I would encourage people to consider medicine.

239
00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:30.130
I'll say one more thing and I'm, I'm happy to take some questions.

240
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.919
So people I think are afraid of medicine because they feel like

241
00:11:33.169 --> 00:11:35.849
I'm not good at math or I'm not good at science. And,

242
00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:36.880
you know, I,

243
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:42.299
I think it may be that math and science aren't like your strengths necessarily.

244
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.520
But I think if you work really hard, you can, you can overcome

245
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:49.260
those things. I, I got a five credit DD

246
00:11:49.869 --> 00:11:51.179
in chemistry in college,

247
00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:53.880
you know, and, and I, I actually,

248
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.780
I advertised that because that failure taught me an enormous amount

249
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.440
about how to succeed and what it took.

250
00:12:01.669 --> 00:12:03.510
And so I then went back

251
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.169
and I took another chemistry class and I got an a,

252
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.539
um, because I learned, you know, what, what, what,

253
00:12:08.549 --> 00:12:10.940
what's required and it wasn't because I was good at chemistry.

254
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.530
I was actually pretty bad at chemistry

255
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.630
but you, you kind of figure it out over time.

256
00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:17.140
Um, I was a terrible math student.

257
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:18.969
Um, in high school.

258
00:12:18.979 --> 00:12:20.020
I was like in that,

259
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.619
at that point in eighth grade I was focused on like trying to pass math.

260
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.950
Um and I got an a in calculus, you know, at Columbia eventually. So,

261
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.830
you know what you decide right now in terms of

262
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.700
what your strengths are and how you kind of view things

263
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.960
may not necessarily be how you see things in five years or 10 years.

264
00:12:39.309 --> 00:12:40.700
So don't, don't um

265
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.400
don't kind of predetermine your future

266
00:12:43.849 --> 00:12:48.119
based on very small experiences and find mentors, find people that are gonna like,

267
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.849
inspire you and teach you and look out for you that's really important.

268
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.409
Excellent.

269
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.510
And um just like a, I know your day is so varied.

270
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.109
So I'm gonna say a day in your life,

271
00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:03.419
but it's more like a month in your life because

272
00:13:03.429 --> 00:13:05.869
you have so many different roles that you play.

273
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.469
Um

274
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.510
You, you know, obviously run clinical trials, you see patients.

275
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.750
Um Can you, can you try to describe how varied your day is?

276
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.770
And a lot of our students do ask, is there um

277
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.020
like a balance between family life and work life.

278
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.309
Yeah.

279
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.030
Um,

280
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.950
so, yeah, that, you know, balance is really important to achieve.

281
00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:31.580
Um, I'm still trying to figure that balance thing out.

282
00:13:32.349 --> 00:13:36.369
Um, I think what I like the most about my job is, is actually all the variety.

283
00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:37.650
Um, I mean,

284
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.890
a day and a month are actually similar in some sense.

285
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.460
I mean, I, I came into the office this morning at

286
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:44.619
eight.

287
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.109
I, well, I, I was up earlier, I,

288
00:13:47.119 --> 00:13:50.770
I had some balance in the sense that I went to exercise in the morning.

289
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.140
I took care of myself a little bit.

290
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.940
At eight, I was in the office, I saw a patient from 815 to 9,

291
00:13:56.739 --> 00:14:01.539
from 9 to 930. I interviewed somebody for a job who wants to come onto our faculty.

292
00:14:02.229 --> 00:14:04.010
From 930 to 10.

293
00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:06.020
I,

294
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.010
I can't remember. I think it was an administrative meeting.

295
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:10.419
I do some administrative stuff.

296
00:14:11.299 --> 00:14:11.960
Um

297
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:17.500
From 11 to 12, I sat in a lecture so I was able to kind of just learn some stuff.

298
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.330
It was like a grand rounds of sorts

299
00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:25.580
from 12 to 1. I saw a patient who is actually participating in a clinical trial. So

300
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:27.380
at eight o'clock this morning, it was like a,

301
00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.750
a patient who I'm just taking care of an ongoing care.

302
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.320
And then at noon,

303
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.419
I saw a patient who's being taken care of in the

304
00:14:32.429 --> 00:14:36.960
context of a very strict protocol who is doing an experimental uh

305
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:42.969
treatment trial. Essentially from 1 to 130. I eat, like I have to eat periodically.

306
00:14:42.979 --> 00:14:44.289
Otherwise I get very grumpy

307
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.460
and now I'm on a call with you guys so you can see the variety and it's really,

308
00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:48.880
really cool and, and lots of fun.

309
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.880
And this afternoon

310
00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:53.419
I have another extensive research evaluation.

311
00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:54.750
Um, I have,

312
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.760
I'm sitting in on a conference call that's more academic and

313
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.299
then I have a couple of patients in the evening.

314
00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:01.270
So I should be home by 730.

315
00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:02.690
I would say

316
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:05.109
have dinner with my wife and kids.

317
00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:07.669
I'll probably be asleep by 930

318
00:15:09.919 --> 00:15:10.580
maybe 10.

319
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.799
I'll watch some TV, maybe I'll do a little reading. Yeah.

320
00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:14.780
Um,

321
00:15:15.869 --> 00:15:16.690
it is, it,

322
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.760
it you and we know how busy you are and that you

323
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:24.760
um are always being asked to uh participate in various studies and,

324
00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.479
and clinical trials. Um So

325
00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:28.239
I'll let,

326
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.059
I'll let our students think about that a little

327
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.239
bit because I wanna make sure Angela has the time

328
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.549
to share her, her um trajectory to where she is today.

329
00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:42.479
And um then we'll really open it up for questions because oftentimes our questions,

330
00:15:42.489 --> 00:15:45.580
um both of our speakers have a chance to, to share.

331
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.099
So Angela, why don't you go ahead and,

332
00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:51.030
and share a little bit about your experience to get where you are today?

333
00:15:51.859 --> 00:15:55.080
Sure. Um I am, I'm Angela.

334
00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.390
I'm currently 1/4 year graduate student

335
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.039
in the psychology department at Rutgers University

336
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.119
and specifically, I'm in the Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience area.

337
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.909
Um So behavioral Neuroscience just means that I am

338
00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:09.799
very interested in what the brain is doing.

339
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.760
But I'm also interested in interpreting behavior

340
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.320
to see what's happening in the brain

341
00:16:14.419 --> 00:16:16.349
and interpreting what's happening in the brain

342
00:16:16.359 --> 00:16:18.960
to see why the behavior is happening.

343
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.280
Um

344
00:16:20.539 --> 00:16:22.179
I graduated from

345
00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:26.159
Ketchum in 2013. So it's been a while now. Um

346
00:16:26.429 --> 00:16:29.880
And I was one of those students who was just good at everything,

347
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.070
which really sounds like a humble brag.

348
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.690
Um And it's, it's not a bad thing, but when it came time to say, what do I want to do?

349
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.640
What I want to be? When I grew up in college,

350
00:16:38.859 --> 00:16:41.960
I had no idea. I had no idea what I wanted to do.

351
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.390
People would be like, well, what are you good at in school?

352
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.020
And the answer is, well, there's nothing that really stands out.

353
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.619
Everything is, I'm just sort of,

354
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.020
I could do it all really.

355
00:16:51.489 --> 00:16:52.250
So

356
00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:57.440
I ended up, I didn't end up, I chose Binghamton University um for a couple of reasons.

357
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.320
It's a really great university, a great education. It's a suny.

358
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.330
So you save your money a little bit that way.

359
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.709
Um And it's also a pretty big university.

360
00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:08.589
So I'm at Rutgers right now which has like 50,000 undergrads, which is huge.

361
00:17:08.598 --> 00:17:10.989
Binghamton had like 16,000.

362
00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:16.569
So it was big but not like out of this world. Huge. Um And I wanted a bigger university.

363
00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:17.189
So that,

364
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:23.300
because I was undecided if I wanted to be a journalist one day next semester,

365
00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.598
I wanted to be a pharmacist.

366
00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:28.439
I didn't have to leave my college. I didn't have to transfer universities.

367
00:17:28.449 --> 00:17:30.839
I could really stay where I was. Um,

368
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.280
and so I knew what I didn't like. I didn't like math.

369
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.939
I wasn't really a huge fan of history and I knew I'm, I'm very much a people person.

370
00:17:38.949 --> 00:17:40.780
I like being with people and working with people,

371
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.280
but I didn't want to work with people in any kind of medical or clinical capacity.

372
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:46.839
Um I just felt like

373
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.229
it could be

374
00:17:49.439 --> 00:17:52.500
kind of draining. I know it can be very rewarding to work with people.

375
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.260
But I just felt like for me that wasn't gonna be what I wanted.

376
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.760
Um But I did like science and everything.

377
00:17:58.209 --> 00:18:01.939
So I went in and I was like, maybe psychology because I really like criminal minds.

378
00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:03.459
I watched that a lot in high school

379
00:18:03.469 --> 00:18:07.319
and I actually applied to forensic psychology programs.

380
00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:08.579
I really considered it.

381
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.930
So that's why I was kind of thinking psychology.

382
00:18:10.939 --> 00:18:13.459
My first semester I took an intro psych course

383
00:18:13.589 --> 00:18:16.459
and I didn't love it because

384
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.750
a lot of psychology, well, there's like cognition, there's social psychology,

385
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.510
there's developmental psychology

386
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.300
and those weren't really areas that interests me.

387
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.339
And then we started talking about like neuroscience and behavioral neuroscience.

388
00:18:29.349 --> 00:18:35.079
Um And like what the brain is doing on like a chemical, molecular sort of matter.

389
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.920
And that's what I really liked.

390
00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:40.089
And I found out through a friend that Binghamton

391
00:18:40.099 --> 00:18:42.540
had an integrated neuroscience program and I was like,

392
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.849
that sounds really interesting.

393
00:18:43.979 --> 00:18:47.020
And so if I had never run into that friend,

394
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.709
I don't know if I would have ever ended up doing neuroscience,

395
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.199
but everything sort of fell in place with me.

396
00:18:53.209 --> 00:18:54.479
And by the end of my freshman year

397
00:18:54.489 --> 00:18:57.170
I had declared as an integrative neuroscience major.

398
00:18:57.349 --> 00:19:00.719
My sophomore year, I took a drugs and behavior course

399
00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:03.680
and I really, really liked that.

400
00:19:04.079 --> 00:19:06.300
Um I thought it was really interesting how you can

401
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.380
add something to a system and see it change.

402
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:13.699
So you're adding any kind of drug to the body, it affects the central nervous system,

403
00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:16.089
it affects your behavior, things like that.

404
00:19:16.229 --> 00:19:17.569
And that was my sophomore year.

405
00:19:17.579 --> 00:19:21.290
And around that time, I had a lot of friends who were, um,

406
00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:26.380
they were joining research labs and I was like, maybe I should be doing that too.

407
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.380
So I joined a research lab as an undergraduate research assistant

408
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.619
working in an alcohol lab.

409
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:37.099
We were working with road models of chronic alcohol exposure to see the,

410
00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:39.540
to study the neurobiology of learning and memory.

411
00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:42.189
And I was actually really nervous to work with

412
00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:44.609
animals at first because I love animals so much.

413
00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:46.069
My cat's my best friend

414
00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.030
and I know animal research is really important,

415
00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:51.560
but I wasn't sure I would feel doing it

416
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.670
um, but the animals are held to the highest standards. They are treated so well.

417
00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.959
They get vet visits every day. They, there's really,

418
00:19:59.069 --> 00:20:00.489
it's hard, but

419
00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:03.160
it makes sense and it, it was ok for me.

420
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.439
So that was like my first experience working with animals. Um, and I really liked it.

421
00:20:07.449 --> 00:20:12.119
I really like that. I could do something experimental to an animal.

422
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.439
Follow it through. I can see its behavior.

423
00:20:14.449 --> 00:20:17.400
Unfortunately, you do have to kill the animal to collect its brain.

424
00:20:17.489 --> 00:20:22.750
But then I can look at the brain cells and see the impact of the behavioral paradigm,

425
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.280
the animal went through or that alcohol treatment that the animal had.

426
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.079
And so I really like that

427
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.380
and it wasn't until the end of my junior year of college that I was like,

428
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.280
maybe I should go to grad school because I started thinking,

429
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.839
ok, I have one more year of college left.

430
00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:42.069
What am I gonna do with a Bachelor's degree in integrative Neuroscience.

431
00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:42.900
Um,

432
00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:47.739
and one of the reasons I didn't want to do psychology because in my head as a freshman,

433
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.890
I was like, if you get a psych degree, you're a counselor or a therapist or something.

434
00:20:52.069 --> 00:20:56.099
And I didn't want to go to all that school. I didn't want to be in school till I was 30.

435
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.219
Um, as it turns out, I'll be in school until I'm 27.

436
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.819
Um, but

437
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.930
I really like this path, my undergrad research experience really

438
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.709
I feel like it kind of like fell in my lap happened,

439
00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:11.500
but that's what set me on the path that I'm on now.

440
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.329
And so

441
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:13.489
I,

442
00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:16.160
like I said, I majored in integrative neuroscience,

443
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:20.310
which was essentially an entire psychology degree as well as chemistry.

444
00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:24.119
Um, I had to take physics, which was horrible. Physics is really hard.

445
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.290
Like I said, I don't like math.

446
00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:25.849
Um,

447
00:21:25.859 --> 00:21:31.109
some upper level level bio courses and some math courses with nothing too advanced.

448
00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:31.630
Um,

449
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.829
a lot of people actually used that degree at Binghamton for like a pre health track.

450
00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:39.390
So I took a lot of like classes that a lot of like med students would have taken.

451
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.310
But I tailored it more to be more on like the psychology side.

452
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.770
And so the psychology classes came easy to me,

453
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.560
it was something I was very interested in.

454
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.790
Um,

455
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.650
so I did get a good amount of A's in college,

456
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.640
but I also got some B's and C's in some of my harder classes.

457
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:59.569
I ended up graduating with a 34, which it's not bad but, you know,

458
00:21:59.579 --> 00:22:00.530
like it's not excellent.

459
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.410
I didn't get to graduate with honors or anything.

460
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.430
Um And I say that because for grad school,

461
00:22:06.489 --> 00:22:09.609
I had like this preconceived notion that like the best of the best

462
00:22:09.619 --> 00:22:12.469
students go on to grad school to go on and get these,

463
00:22:12.479 --> 00:22:14.609
like, you know, their MD, their phd.

464
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.989
Um And so

465
00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:19.770
I really sort of doubted myself as an applicant because I

466
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.050
was comparing myself to other people and things like that.

467
00:22:23.599 --> 00:22:28.030
But I had good, I had really good grades in my psychology classes.

468
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.390
And then I had mostly these, these pluses in my others.

469
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:35.229
And I was applying to psychology programs for grad school.

470
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.109
Um, grad school,

471
00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.599
there's so much involved in grad school and depending on what

472
00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:41.020
you want to do or where you want to go.

473
00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:45.260
Um, I really like neuroscience, but like I said, I like behavioral neuroscience,

474
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.380
which is typically held in psychology departments.

475
00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:53.260
So I focused my grad school search for psychology departments

476
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.180
with areas of research that interested me

477
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:01.680
because in psychology departments, you get accepted to a faculty members lab

478
00:23:01.979 --> 00:23:04.020
and if you don't

479
00:23:04.489 --> 00:23:07.760
match up with a faculty member, you don't really get accepted to the program.

480
00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:10.910
There's other programs that sort of rotate, there's a lot that goes into it,

481
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.989
but I knew exactly what I wanted to research or I thought I did, I really,

482
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:15.939
really like drugs.

483
00:23:15.949 --> 00:23:17.910
I think drugs are really cool, studying them.

484
00:23:18.199 --> 00:23:18.829
Um

485
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.650
So I wanted to do drugs and I wanted to do addiction research.

486
00:23:22.969 --> 00:23:26.550
Um and that's how I ended up at Rutgers. Um

487
00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.420
And there's a lot more information on the powerpoint about how I ended up there.

488
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.270
So you can always check and read that.

489
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.650
Um But

490
00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.310
the phd program is typically a five year program

491
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:43.040
and what's really great about getting a phd in psychology or biology,

492
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.250
neuroscience, chemistry,

493
00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.400
things like that is that you get paid to be a graduate student.

494
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:52.180
So I signed up for five more years of college, but I also signed a contract.

495
00:23:52.189 --> 00:23:55.780
So I'm getting paid for these five years and I'm not paying my tuition,

496
00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:57.510
I never see a bill for my tuition.

497
00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:00.670
So I'm getting a phd for free and they're paying me and

498
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.829
they're paying me because I'm doing really important work for the university.

499
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.310
I'm doing really important research and I also teach

500
00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:08.750
classes as part of that stipend that I earn.

501
00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:13.589
So I teach classes in the undergraduate psychology department at Rutgers,

502
00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:18.550
which is really great experience because I was 22

503
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.479
when I graduated college. So I was teaching

504
00:24:21.599 --> 00:24:27.510
other 22 year olds at 22. I'm 25 now. So I'm like teaching my peers basically.

505
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.079
Um And teaching is something that I'm comfortable in.

506
00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:32.449
It's an experience that I think I'm good at,

507
00:24:32.459 --> 00:24:34.599
but it's not necessarily what I really want.

508
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.069
I really like being in the lab. I really like my research.

509
00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:42.839
I think it's very rewarding. I'm seeing my education pay off every day.

510
00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:47.660
Um And grad school is really great because obviously I like learning

511
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.239
if I was gonna sign up for five more years of school

512
00:24:50.469 --> 00:24:54.650
and in high school, they want you to be a really well rounded student

513
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:59.010
in college, you have to take gen EDS. So you're a well rounded student.

514
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.069
But grad school is where you pick what you want to study, what you're interested in.

515
00:25:03.359 --> 00:25:06.579
And so, like I said, I'm really interested in drugs and behavior.

516
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.219
Um,

517
00:25:07.229 --> 00:25:09.540
if you were interested in another facet of

518
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:13.060
psychology or neuroscience or any other topic,

519
00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:14.939
you study what you want to study.

520
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:20.280
And so I'm currently researching the effects of chronic opioid abuse on how

521
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.030
your immune system functions and how your

522
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.140
immune system communicates with your brain.

523
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:29.040
And I think it's really super cool. Um But there's so many other things you can do.

524
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:31.010
I know, not everyone loves playing with brains,

525
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.939
but I get to go and I get to slice brains and I stain brains and I

526
00:25:34.949 --> 00:25:39.180
look at the cells and I see the impact of the treatment that I did on them.

527
00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.920
Um And I really love my research.

528
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.089
So I think if,

529
00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:46.410
if you can take any sort of opportunity,

530
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.010
if you kind of like science and things like that, any opportunity

531
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:54.949
to get you, I don't know any kind of experience in college or anything like that,

532
00:25:54.959 --> 00:25:56.459
that would be my advice.

533
00:25:56.469 --> 00:25:58.630
But also other advice,

534
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.810
even if you don't wanna go on like necessarily a research route,

535
00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:04.459
but you want to do like the health care sort of field

536
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.390
um would be to not underestimate yourself as a student or an applicant.

537
00:26:08.689 --> 00:26:10.709
I compared myself to everyone.

538
00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:15.099
I compared my grades, I compared my experiences, you know,

539
00:26:15.109 --> 00:26:18.270
my extracurricular activities because I felt like

540
00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.270
I wasn't a perfect applicant and honestly,

541
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.770
that did hold me back from applying to maybe programs or schools that I wanted to.

542
00:26:24.969 --> 00:26:29.189
Um because I just couldn't get myself to do it and I missed the deadline.

543
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.219
Um,

544
00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.290
but looking back,

545
00:26:32.469 --> 00:26:34.930
I had my own unique experience

546
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.270
and everyone has a unique experience and it was,

547
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.089
it's like comparing apples and oranges.

548
00:26:39.319 --> 00:26:42.660
Um, so don't let your grades get you down. Like

549
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.180
I had a couple C's

550
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.520
um Doctor Coulson

551
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.530
had ad, you know,

552
00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.530
um you can bounce back from it and it's not sort of like the end of the world.

553
00:26:51.839 --> 00:26:52.530
Um

554
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.949
So I guess that was my trajectory a day in my life.

555
00:26:56.979 --> 00:26:59.709
It really kind of depends as a grad student.

556
00:26:59.719 --> 00:27:03.520
My first two years, I was taking classes while working in the lab.

557
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:07.510
Now I am done taking classes. I never have to take class again, which is wonderful.

558
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.599
Um And it really kind of depends on where my

559
00:27:10.609 --> 00:27:13.750
experiment is because I am in charge of project management.

560
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.430
I do personnel management. I do finance management.

561
00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:20.800
I really run my lab and I'm in charge of making sure everything gets done.

562
00:27:21.329 --> 00:27:24.400
So right now, I am currently staining brain tissue.

563
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:29.770
I had rats um self administer fentaNYL, a really, really strong opioid,

564
00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:31.979
they self administered fentaNYL.

565
00:27:31.989 --> 00:27:34.859
And then I am looking at certain immune cells in

566
00:27:34.869 --> 00:27:37.260
the brain to see how they responded to that treatment.

567
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.829
So I spend my days staining cells,

568
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.500
I'll be imaging cells. I'll be counting cells.

569
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.040
I'm also working on publishing some of my data, so I'll be a published author soon.

570
00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:49.300
So I'm writing up papers. Um

571
00:27:49.439 --> 00:27:54.260
I enjoy writing. So writing, I mean, it's a very tedious task, but I like it in the end.

572
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.020
Writing is something I'm good at, so

573
00:27:56.339 --> 00:27:57.750
I enjoy doing that.

574
00:27:58.469 --> 00:27:59.170
Um

575
00:27:59.979 --> 00:28:00.810
So my,

576
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.489
my day to day it,

577
00:28:02.959 --> 00:28:05.369
it's very casual, it's very casual in the lab.

578
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.310
Um

579
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.329
And in terms of a work life balance

580
00:28:08.459 --> 00:28:11.050
with grad school, unfortunately,

581
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.050
it's kind of expected that you spend all your time in the lab,

582
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.930
you spend a lot of time doing your schoolwork, doing your research.

583
00:28:20.099 --> 00:28:23.119
That's not to say that you can't accomplish a healthy work life balance.

584
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.250
That's something that I really pride myself on.

585
00:28:25.479 --> 00:28:26.459
I just like,

586
00:28:26.469 --> 00:28:29.780
feel deep in my bones that I will not like give

587
00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.439
my life up for my work for my education or anything.

588
00:28:33.449 --> 00:28:35.890
I think there has to be a place for a healthy work life balance.

589
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.300
So I fully feel like I do achieve it.

590
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.540
I do have really early mornings and really late nights sometimes.

591
00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:43.239
Um, but

592
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.859
I make sure that I have most of my weekends, I make sure that after dinner

593
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.339
I have my free time

594
00:28:49.444 --> 00:28:52.454
because it's not like I'm studying for exams anymore.

595
00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:56.064
I feel this really feels like a job like I am a neuroscientist.

596
00:28:56.074 --> 00:29:00.885
And so I want to treat it like a job because I've been in school since I was five.

597
00:29:00.895 --> 00:29:01.895
I'm 25 now.

598
00:29:01.905 --> 00:29:07.425
So it's been 20 years and I'm getting a little tired of feeling like a student.

599
00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:10.484
So I'm trying to do things that make me feel like an

600
00:29:10.494 --> 00:29:13.344
adult because I am an adult even though I'm still a student.

601
00:29:13.604 --> 00:29:16.064
Um, so it's sort of like a weird transition.

602
00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.599
Um But yeah, I hope that answered

603
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.500
the task there.

604
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:23.800
You definitely did a great job and there is tons of

605
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.420
information on the slide so students can go back to that.

606
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.839
So, do you want to open it up to our students?

607
00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:34.079
Um to see if anyone would like to turn their camera on to ask a question

608
00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:38.640
or um if you'd like to come off uh mute or put something in the chat,

609
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:40.239
um

610
00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:42.800
I'll give everyone a second or two.

611
00:29:45.959 --> 00:29:46.849
OK. OK. Good.

612
00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.699
So,

613
00:29:47.709 --> 00:29:49.829
um Rebecca is asking what exactly is

614
00:29:49.839 --> 00:29:52.859
the difference between psychology and psychiatry?

615
00:29:52.869 --> 00:29:55.500
So, Doctor Alex, do you want to take that one?

616
00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.380
Um

617
00:29:57.579 --> 00:29:59.020
So in practice,

618
00:29:59.329 --> 00:29:59.760
there's

619
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.780
significant differences, although there's also a lot of overlap

620
00:30:03.439 --> 00:30:07.130
in terms of the training, there's there, there's a dramatic difference. Um

621
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.750
So clinical psychology

622
00:30:10.979 --> 00:30:15.000
um tends to require graduate school in psychology.

623
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.920
Whereas psychiatry requires medical school

624
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.550
in practice, clinical psychologists, if they're working with patients,

625
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.630
for example,

626
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.280
will do therapy

627
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.000
and psychiatrists can do therapy, but they're also able to prescribe medication.

628
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.640
So

629
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.439
I would say psychiatry is probably more biologically based,

630
00:30:34.449 --> 00:30:36.760
more focused on disease and

631
00:30:37.739 --> 00:30:40.199
biologically based or medication based treatments.

632
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.189
Um And the training pathway is very different. Um

633
00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:48.219
But yet they both deal very clearly with the same organ which is the brain of the mind.

634
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.000
And um

635
00:30:50.699 --> 00:30:52.680
and there's a lot of overlap in terms of the

636
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.540
patients that we see, there's a lot of collaboration between the,

637
00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:56.670
between the two fields.

638
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:56.979
So

639
00:30:57.359 --> 00:31:00.560
I I work closely with lots of psychologists,

640
00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:05.459
people, people tend to boil it down to something very basic, which is that

641
00:31:05.619 --> 00:31:08.010
psychiatrists prescribe medicine, psychologists do therapy.

642
00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:10.859
Right.

643
00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:11.589
Right.

644
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.479
Um Definitely the training is, is, is different. Um

645
00:31:16.699 --> 00:31:19.270
because you have to understand the medical implications,

646
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.140
other questions

647
00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:24.410
and

648
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.989
give everyone a chance to think through

649
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.199
um

650
00:31:28.359 --> 00:31:31.199
-- questions. Maya, you wanna ask a question, you
-- can come off.

651
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.900
Um I don't necessarily have a question.

652
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:38.160
Um This is my first time joining you guys as zoom because every time I always end up

653
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.790
being at work so early and I never get a chance to join. And I just wanna say that

654
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.369
I appreciate the transparency because right now I think because of,

655
00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:47.130
you know,

656
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.170
everything that's going on last year and this year that I haven't done the best

657
00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.689
academically and I would like to go to med school and because of my grades,

658
00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:56.369
it's made me like really nervous about what I wanna do in the future

659
00:31:56.729 --> 00:31:58.810
and you know, hearing other people that

660
00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:03.160
get bad grades and they compare themselves to others and you know, stuff like that.

661
00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.010
It just

662
00:32:04.349 --> 00:32:07.140
makes you feel like, ok, this is, this is a normal feeling and, you know,

663
00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.859
I'll get through it and it's not the end of the world.

664
00:32:08.869 --> 00:32:11.959
So I really do appreciate you guys telling your stories and you know,

665
00:32:11.969 --> 00:32:14.069
your tasks in everyday life and stuff like that.

666
00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:18.400
Well, thank you, maya. Yeah, de de determination. Go ahead, doctor.

667
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.060
No, I mean, I, I Yeah, II, I appreciate the comment. I don't know.

668
00:32:23.069 --> 00:32:24.260
What, what year are you right now?

669
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.640
I'm a junior

670
00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:28.979
in high school. Yes. Yeah.

671
00:32:29.229 --> 00:32:29.839
So

672
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.560
it's not too late.

673
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:32.599
Believe me.

674
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.459
I think the, you know, the barrier to entry for medical school is very, very high.

675
00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:41.900
So I, I don't mean to sugar coat it. Obviously grades need to be very, very high.

676
00:32:42.599 --> 00:32:47.750
Um, at some point. But what, where your grades are now, I can say with confidence are

677
00:32:48.229 --> 00:32:51.319
entirely irrelevant to whether you can make it to medical school or not.

678
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.380
I, I mean,

679
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:57.219
II I appreciated Angela's point about not wanting school to take over your life.

680
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.849
I would say with medicine,

681
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.900
it does at least for a brief period of time, take over your life. It is everything

682
00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:06.709
because you wanna kind of get yourself into the school.

683
00:33:06.869 --> 00:33:07.650
Um,

684
00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.300
the hardest time in my life was the year

685
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.430
that I was applying to medical school for sure.

686
00:33:13.439 --> 00:33:15.579
Or I didn't know what I get in when I knock it in.

687
00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:19.569
I was so preoccupied with my grades and looking back and all the regrets and

688
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.849
I should have gotten this

689
00:33:20.969 --> 00:33:24.550
A plus instead of a B or an A minus. And I thought everything hinged.

690
00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.550
Then there's a great joke that, um, once you get into medical school,

691
00:33:30.329 --> 00:33:33.469
do you know what they call the person that graduates last in their class

692
00:33:34.449 --> 00:33:35.079
doctor?

693
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.160
So once you get in, you just have to pass your glasses and get through it.

694
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:44.459
-- Excellent
-- advice,

695
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.099
other questions.

696
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:54.930
Um I'll open up to our panel too as I

697
00:33:54.939 --> 00:33:57.680
uh kind of go through some of our previous questions.

698
00:33:57.689 --> 00:33:58.199
Um

699
00:33:58.969 --> 00:34:00.750
If anyone wants to come off,

700
00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:02.900
I can ask a question.

701
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:05.709
I did,

702
00:34:05.719 --> 00:34:11.870
I would like to ask um Doctor Alex about the research you're doing as psychiatrist.

703
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.260
-- Can. Can you share
-- a little? Yeah, of course.

704
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.780
So when I started practicing as a psychiatrist,

705
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:23.250
I found myself frustrated at our inability to really predict

706
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.310
who might respond to certain kinds of treatments, right?

707
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.530
We have lots of treatments for anxiety and depression and

708
00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.228
various other symptoms, but

709
00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.350
we don't do a very good job of being able to predict

710
00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.290
who might respond to a certain treatment over another treatment.

711
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.090
And so I got interested in the idea of predicting treatment response and,

712
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:43.149
and using things like genetics

713
00:34:43.649 --> 00:34:45.590
or biomarkers, you know,

714
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.510
kind of biological markers in the blood or using um techniques that measure

715
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.750
electrical activity in the brain, like using EEG

716
00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.000
and I thought, wow, you know,

717
00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.959
it's wonderful to be able to treat patients and affect

718
00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:02.520
families on kind of a case by case basis.

719
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.770
But when you do research,

720
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.129
you can theoretically kind of move the whole field forward and you can,

721
00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:10.199
you can kind of, you know, drive major change.

722
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.439
And so I got interested in clinical trials where we

723
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.530
use things like genetics and we select

724
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:21.649
populations of patients based on underlying genetic changes,

725
00:35:21.959 --> 00:35:26.159
whether it's a specific genetic mutation in the gene that causes autism.

726
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.530
Um

727
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.739
And we try to understand

728
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:34.689
the changes in the brain on the basis of what we know about the genetic changes.

729
00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.169
And then we think about ways to compensate for

730
00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:39.939
those changes in the brain using specific medicines.

731
00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:42.409
And then we study them in the context of a clinical trial.

732
00:35:42.419 --> 00:35:42.929
We will,

733
00:35:42.939 --> 00:35:45.350
we will take patients with a specific genetic mutation

734
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.929
and we will enroll them either in a placebo

735
00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:51.669
group or a medication group and then we will follow them over time

736
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:54.669
and we will look at improvement in, in, in clinical outcomes.

737
00:35:55.379 --> 00:35:58.199
Um And the, the goal is to develop new treatments.

738
00:35:58.209 --> 00:36:00.850
Mostly my, my research is mostly focused on autism.

739
00:36:00.929 --> 00:36:02.330
So the goal is to develop new treatments

740
00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:03.270
in autism,

741
00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:07.979
I think to the nice parallel between like

742
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:11.580
um the bridging between the work that Angela does even though

743
00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:13.610
um maybe the study on o

744
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.550
opioids isn't the same but

745
00:36:15.909 --> 00:36:18.600
that it has to come from the animal point to come

746
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.219
to you because your trials are on humans where her trials,

747
00:36:22.229 --> 00:36:22.449
you,

748
00:36:22.459 --> 00:36:24.860
you take the studies that develop through the

749
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.639
research that comes from those animal trials.

750
00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.179
Um I don't know if either one of you wanna expand on that, how

751
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.219
they feed into one another,

752
00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.310
-- the importance of
-- both.

753
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:39.409
Um Yeah, of course.

754
00:36:39.419 --> 00:36:40.409
Um Ultimately,

755
00:36:40.419 --> 00:36:42.179
I feel like everything that we do in research

756
00:36:42.189 --> 00:36:44.729
is to improve some kind of human experience.

757
00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:50.580
Um And so I study drug addiction and although I'm interested in sort of like neuro

758
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.399
immunomodulation,

759
00:36:52.659 --> 00:36:56.290
um I'm well versed in a lot of different aspects of it.

760
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.340
Um

761
00:36:57.459 --> 00:37:02.040
And so I do read human clinical trials sort of to see, get more background,

762
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.290
get more information,

763
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.500
but just, um I mean, I'm not the most well versed in clinical trials,

764
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:10.520
but I do know that a lot of things, a lot of drug trials,

765
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:13.139
it has to start in an animal model first because

766
00:37:13.149 --> 00:37:15.909
you can't just recruit people off the street and said,

767
00:37:15.919 --> 00:37:19.270
hey, I have this new pill, I'd love to see how it works.

768
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.669
Would you like to try it?

769
00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:27.229
Um It's, that's very unethical. So the ethical route is to start in an animal model.

770
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.020
And so if I can see, for instance, um

771
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.820
my research is based on the fact that

772
00:37:33.949 --> 00:37:36.699
um a lot of chronic opioid users,

773
00:37:36.709 --> 00:37:39.379
whether it's addiction or if it's like a chronic opioid

774
00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:41.969
treatment with your doctor or something for chronic pain,

775
00:37:42.229 --> 00:37:46.429
there is some kind of degree of suppression of immune system activity.

776
00:37:46.439 --> 00:37:48.360
So that means that you are more susceptible

777
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:51.899
to infection or illness than a healthy individual.

778
00:37:52.469 --> 00:37:54.600
And so, with my animal model,

779
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:59.389
I'm looking to see what is the degree of this suppression for chronic opioid abuse.

780
00:37:59.409 --> 00:38:02.620
And does this recover after a certain period of abstinence?

781
00:38:02.629 --> 00:38:06.419
And this, of course, I'm sure you can imagine has a ton of implications,

782
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:12.649
but if I can identify what exactly is being suppressed, how it is being suppressed.

783
00:38:12.689 --> 00:38:16.239
Um and maybe speculate on what this could mean,

784
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:22.850
this could be used potentially in um rehabilitation facilities or

785
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.370
sort of trials that are looking to help

786
00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.110
um drug addicts recover.

787
00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.459
Um Maybe one day very, very far in the future, we can cure addiction

788
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:37.250
and it will take a lot of, you know, collaboration from a lot of different groups.

789
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.250
But so my research, although it is in animals,

790
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:45.110
the findings could have very significant implications for human trials.

791
00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.219
And so we're not completely, I'm not completely removed from human trials,

792
00:38:49.229 --> 00:38:50.850
although I probably won't ever

793
00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.909
my my specific research,

794
00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.860
I would not bring that to human clinical trials because that's like very,

795
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.550
very far away.

796
00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.479
But I would pass it on to someone like Doctor

797
00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:01.949
Alex if he was researching something that I was,

798
00:39:01.959 --> 00:39:03.270
and it's something that we could

799
00:39:03.459 --> 00:39:07.270
collaborate about and I can tell him hinge findings and then someone who is more

800
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.229
well versed with humans can see how do we adapt that to a human trial?

801
00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:14.360
Mhm.

802
00:39:16.659 --> 00:39:21.090
Are there any other questions or anything that anyone would like to add?

803
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.270
Very quiet today

804
00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.219
and try

805
00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:30.479
Doctor Alex?

806
00:39:30.489 --> 00:39:35.770
Are there any skills that, um, you could share with our students that you feel um,

807
00:39:35.879 --> 00:39:37.629
would be beneficial for them?

808
00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:40.040
So soft, the soft skills that, um,

809
00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.949
you can learn in a textbook or in a college classroom?

810
00:39:42.959 --> 00:39:43.379
But

811
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.010
if it's something that they could work on and then also,

812
00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.320
I always want to ask if there's internship

813
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:51.550
opportunities or shadowing opportunities for our students,

814
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.909
if they wanted to learn more about this field.

815
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.530
Sure.

816
00:39:56.729 --> 00:39:57.939
I think um

817
00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.189
I mean, as a physician, somebody who works with people,

818
00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:06.790
I think probably the most important skill is a communication skill, the ability to

819
00:40:07.899 --> 00:40:10.760
express things in language that can be easily understood.

820
00:40:11.969 --> 00:40:14.750
I think that skill also translates to being a good teacher.

821
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:15.810
So if you can

822
00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:21.030
take complicated ideas and explain them to people, so they understand

823
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.260
that's extremely valuable.

824
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.350
Um So communication skills and then

825
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.949
kind of equally important is, is communication skills through writing.

826
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.879
And I know we all spend a lot of time doing emails. Um But I think that

827
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:36.360
you're writing, whether it's, you know,

828
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.360
papers that Angela is working on or even just a simple email,

829
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.320
that's a reflection of you. It's a reflection of how you think.

830
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:45.790
And I think it's worth being very, very thoughtful about

831
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.280
how you want to express yourself um with language and writing.

832
00:40:51.179 --> 00:40:53.439
Um and I, I definitely found that

833
00:40:54.459 --> 00:40:58.199
the ability of someone to kind of progress in their career

834
00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:02.820
after they've all kind of met a certain level of um competency

835
00:41:03.229 --> 00:41:06.520
in, you know, educational skills or, you know, learning

836
00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:09.479
has a lot to do with how well they communicate with others.

837
00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:12.570
Um

838
00:41:13.489 --> 00:41:14.050
Yeah.

839
00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:16.629
Yeah. The second part of the question that I forgot already.

840
00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:23.000
-- That's OK. Um Internships.
-- Uh Yes. Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. So

841
00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:27.739
post COVID, talk to me. So, yeah, I think um we always host students

842
00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:31.760
for shadowing for, for research internships. Um

843
00:41:31.949 --> 00:41:32.969
Even high school,

844
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:33.959
they don't have to be in

845
00:41:34.129 --> 00:41:34.399
college.

846
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.850
-- Yeah,
-- they don't have to be in college. They had to be over 16.

847
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.340
Um There's obviously a pretty significant limitations in terms of what they can do,

848
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:43.659
but there's still learning opportunities that are meaningful

849
00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.320
right now.

850
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.860
It's very challenging because there's limitations being placed based on COVID.

851
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.129
So we're only allowed to have

852
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.229
a certain number of people on site. And

853
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.469
I, I would say

854
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.689
it's also too late frankly, but I think for people that are interested, you know,

855
00:41:55.699 --> 00:41:59.209
get in touch with potential mentors in, you know,

856
00:41:59.629 --> 00:42:03.270
November, December, February. Do it, do it early act early

857
00:42:03.709 --> 00:42:05.149
blanket the universe.

858
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.459
Use any connection you possibly have.

859
00:42:07.469 --> 00:42:11.520
It's very challenging to find mentors that are willing to host students but

860
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.419
don't, don't give up. And every time somebody says no to you say

861
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.179
I appreciate you writing back to me.

862
00:42:17.189 --> 00:42:19.899
Do you have anybody else who might suggest just keep, keep,

863
00:42:19.909 --> 00:42:20.729
keep pummeling away at it?

864
00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:21.979
It's very, very

865
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.610
unfortunate how, how challenging it is but, you know, just keep, keep at it.

866
00:42:26.909 --> 00:42:28.810
Excellent, excellent advice.

867
00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.989
And, um, Lorraine just before we, we let everyone go back to their,

868
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.169
their work days because we do know now how busy they are.

869
00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:39.620
Um, did you want to share a little bit, um, about the,

870
00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:43.239
the Dutchess community connection with the Science Lax program?

871
00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:45.010
Sure.

872
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:49.929
Um Well, you know, and I'm also this time around because of the other track,

873
00:42:49.939 --> 00:42:53.169
going to mention our human services um

874
00:42:53.689 --> 00:42:58.879
psychology track program for associates. So if you're not exactly sure

875
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:04.459
where you wanna go, our liberal arts and science program would be the, the pre

876
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:10.264
med track. But we also do have psychology and if you're really on sure,

877
00:43:10.385 --> 00:43:14.344
we have liberal arts and you can experience all

878
00:43:14.354 --> 00:43:18.104
of these different classes and take some sciences and,

879
00:43:18.114 --> 00:43:20.044
and take some psychology and,

880
00:43:20.235 --> 00:43:25.094
and see where you go because as we, as we've heard from our speakers today

881
00:43:25.389 --> 00:43:28.709
and speakers in the past, sometimes we,

882
00:43:28.719 --> 00:43:32.850
we pivot and we change and I love doctor Alex that you said,

883
00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.909
don't predetermine your future on very small experiences.

884
00:43:36.919 --> 00:43:40.439
We often talk ourselves out of a lot that we're capable of.

885
00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.989
And I really like that. Both of you emphasized uh

886
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:48.669
just working for it, just keep going and keep trying and,

887
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.560
and, and putting your effort in and when you do figure it out,

888
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.370
you will succeed.

889
00:43:57.889 --> 00:44:02.320
I'll ask to answer any questions before we let everyone get back to their busy days.

890
00:44:03.239 --> 00:44:04.860
I heard a great, um,

891
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.899
I heard a great

892
00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:07.800
talk.

893
00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:10.040
I'm, I'm sure it's been passed around and I'm,

894
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.949
and I'm like the last person to mention it, but

895
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.540
it was a, it was an interview and I forgot with whom.

896
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.020
But, you know, the question was asked, you know,

897
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:17.840
what's the best advice that you give young people?

898
00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:18.360
Right? And

899
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.439
I think the person that was, that responded said, you know,

900
00:44:21.449 --> 00:44:25.010
the the standard advice is to find something you're passionate about, right?

901
00:44:25.449 --> 00:44:26.100
And I think that's,

902
00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.830
that's very difficult advice and very kind of misleading

903
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:30.600
because who knows what you're actually passionate about.

904
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:33.370
So the advice is instead find something you're good at

905
00:44:33.729 --> 00:44:35.629
that you actually feel that you're good at

906
00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.179
because if you're good at something you'll inevitably succeed in it.

907
00:44:38.189 --> 00:44:40.929
And if you succeed in it, everything else comes with that you'll get passionate,

908
00:44:40.939 --> 00:44:42.169
you'll have lots of opportunities,

909
00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:45.300
you'll be successful financially and all those kinds of things kind of come with

910
00:44:46.439 --> 00:44:47.060
excellent,

911
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.620
excellent advice and for today. So I just would like to thank all of our speakers.

912
00:44:51.629 --> 00:44:55.600
Um and I'd like to thank you for taking the time to put together all that information.

913
00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.290
And Doctor Alex,

914
00:44:56.300 --> 00:45:01.659
thank you for taking the time to spend with us today and share your experiences.

915
00:45:01.669 --> 00:45:07.060
And um we will have this recording posted on our website so that if you wanna refer,

916
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:11.419
refer it to any of your, your friends, they can watch it as well.

917
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.754
And I will um I'm also a resource for you if you ever want to get in

918
00:45:15.764 --> 00:45:18.245
touch with either of our speakers today um

919
00:45:18.254 --> 00:45:22.155
or make connections for future internships or shadowing.

920
00:45:22.495 --> 00:45:25.834
Um To let me know, I wanna thank um Mary Jane and Lorraine

921
00:45:26.125 --> 00:45:28.155
and Louise for your help as well.

922
00:45:28.165 --> 00:45:32.594
And with that, I um just a reminder that we have one session left in June.

923
00:45:32.604 --> 00:45:35.175
I have been emailing you to ask for

924
00:45:35.445 --> 00:45:39.794
um any, any specific questions you have. But I think we're gonna be focusing on

925
00:45:40.094 --> 00:45:44.260
uh wrap up with the educational component on college and career readiness.

926
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.520
So be looking for additional emails on that.

927
00:45:47.669 --> 00:45:52.469
-- But um Doctor
-- Watkins, can I just um share just real quick. I wanna make sure that

928
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.870
the um students realize that there's uh everything

929
00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:58.879
Angela said is in writing here too.

930
00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.709
So she gives you what her day is.

931
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:06.090
Um her, her research focus, what she'll do with her degree, why she picked the field,

932
00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:10.885
um why she take the phd program over anything else? What courses

933
00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:15.754
um what the process was? Um how did, how did she get in?

934
00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:19.945
I know that's a big question for people. And did she need letters of recommendation?

935
00:46:19.955 --> 00:46:21.534
So I just wanna make sure that, you know,

936
00:46:21.544 --> 00:46:23.574
because we don't always have quite this much information,

937
00:46:23.584 --> 00:46:26.324
but Angela was able to provide us with a lot of information

938
00:46:26.465 --> 00:46:28.334
and then here's the people asked about the grades

939
00:46:28.344 --> 00:46:31.254
and what scores do you need on standardized test?

940
00:46:31.264 --> 00:46:34.094
And do does she pay tuition? So that was all

941
00:46:34.449 --> 00:46:36.959
-- nicely done by Angela. So I wanted to thank
-- her for that.

942
00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:38.050
Yes, she did

943
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.350
very, very, very well rounded in those responses. So thank you.

944
00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.399
And that will that one is already posted on the website

945
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.989
that he will be there in the next day or two.

946
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.790
You can go under students on our website Maya Maya

947
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.270
and then underneath students on the left hand side,

948
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.469
it'll say Career Zoom Series

949
00:46:56.679 --> 00:47:02.060
and you'll still see every um every link that we had since November.

950
00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:02.820
So

951
00:47:03.479 --> 00:47:07.540
um and if and if you have any other for future, uh further questions,

952
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:09.719
you can always email me at Amy dot Watkins

953
00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:12.270

954
00:47:13.889 --> 00:47:17.219
Well, thank you so much. Uh Thank you again to Angela and Doctor Alex.

955
00:47:17.229 --> 00:47:18.179
You've been amazing

956
00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:19.939
and thank you to our students, Rebecca.

957
00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:23.500
I think you get the award for being the most loyal participant.

958
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.739
So, I it wouldn't be the same without you here.

959
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:30.389
So I really hope you decide to go into a field of health sciences after all of this.

960
00:47:30.399 --> 00:47:35.899
So um thank you again. Have a wonderful day. Everyone. Enjoy some vitamin D outside.
