00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.460
Well, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. Um We

1
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.779
have been doing this weekly. I think we are contemplating going back to a less um a

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.189
schedule that might be every other week and we will let you know about that.

3
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.060
Um which is good news, I think because it means that hopefully,

4
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.750
things are not quite as chaotic as they have been.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.379
Um So our panelists today,

6
00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:22.120
you've ha uh we've had the pleasure of having them on before.

7
00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:23.420
Really glad to have them all back.

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.180
We've got Doctor Ruth Macdonald,

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.969
who's the vice president and associate chief Medical Officer at

10
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:29.579
Seattle Children's.

11
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.930
Um There's always been an interest in the impact on pediatric patients.

12
00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:34.930
And I think also

13
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.819
uh we've been talking about the vaccines for 5 to 11. Um

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.720
I'm very personally interested in this topic,

15
00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.619
so we're excited to hear more about that.

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.689
Uh Doctor Tim Deet,

17
00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.000
the Chief Medical Officer at

18
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.740
Medicine,

19
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.349
uh Riza Khalil,

20
00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:51.729
who is the chief executive of Cadillac Health System in uh the tricities. And

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.430
that is a part of the state that's been

22
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:57.360
particularly hit by COVID um throughout the pandemic really.

23
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.049
And finally, Doctor Andrea Carter,

24
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.750
who's the Chief medical Officer at Samaritan Healthcare and

25
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:04.309
Moses Lake also from a part of the state that's

26
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.599
um experienced more than its share of COVID. So really glad to have all of you.

27
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.349
So I'll start with some opening comments and then

28
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.230
I'll turn it over to our panelists for theirs.

29
00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:20.069
So first, the hospitalization rates continue to decline but the decline

30
00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:22.000
is slower.

31
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.279
Um Unfortunately,

32
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.989
it's good that they're declining and we wish they were declining faster.

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.129
So there are

34
00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:33.779
1025 COVID positive patients in hospitals uh this morning compared to

35
00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:37.760
1101 that we reported at the same time last week.

36
00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:41.110
So it is a decline but we wish again, we wish it was more quick.

37
00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.290
Um There is not much of a decline.

38
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.050
Actually, there's really no decline in patients who are on ventilators.

39
00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.540
This week,

40
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.940
there are 100 and 84 patients on ventilators versus

41
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.370
100 and 85 that we reported last week.

42
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.300
That is a different,

43
00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:59.419
it's not the same 185 people who are on ventilators because

44
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.860
what we know is that some people who are on ventilators,

45
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.260
um

46
00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:03.730
some get better

47
00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.099
and some die.

48
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.940
And so there is a change in the patient population.

49
00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:08.979
We wish that there was,

50
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.259
this is a number we would really like to see going down faster because

51
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.160
once patients are on a ventilator there.

52
00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.139
Um As you've heard in this briefing before,

53
00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.279
um their chance of survival goes down pretty significantly.

54
00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.660
So that's a number we would, we really would like to see go down

55
00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.539
and we continue to have about 10 or 15 deaths per day.

56
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.830
That is also a decline, which is good news, but it's still a ton.

57
00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.720
And I think I want to really emphasize that

58
00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.690
this is a new thing COVID clearly in our lives.

59
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.660
If there was something else, I was thinking about this this morning, like,

60
00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:39.880
what else would it be if someone,

61
00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.979
if there was someone who was shooting 10 to 15 people a day or there was a car,

62
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.679
a kind of a car that malfunctioned that caused crashes that

63
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.119
killed the 1010 to 15 people a day in our state.

64
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.139
I

65
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.360
think the response from the public would be tremendous and

66
00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:56.009
it feels we continue to feel in the hospital community like

67
00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.080
people are just like there's more of a, a well,

68
00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.399
um about these COVID deaths and they are tragic.

69
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.460
Every last one of them is tragic. Um

70
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.139
And a huge loss for the community,

71
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.000
for the family and we really want to do everything we can to prevent those.

72
00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.539
And as, as we've said, many times,

73
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.479
vaccination is the number one way.

74
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.880
Um The social distancing remains a really big issue.

75
00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.830
Um

76
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.339
There was uh some information from the Department of Health that they

77
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.820
shared with us last week showing

78
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.660
that people's social circles are becoming increasingly

79
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.580
like if you're vaccinated.

80
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.899
Your people are vaccinated, you know, your friends,

81
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.740
your family tend to all be vaccinated.

82
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.639
If you're unvaccinated, your people are largely unvaccinated. And so

83
00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.679
the clusters of,

84
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.559
of risk for unvaccinated people grow even greater because they're spending

85
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.110
so much of their time around.

86
00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.380
Other folks who are unvaccinated,

87
00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.100
who are like more likely to get to transmit the disease to them.

88
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.770
So that's a

89
00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:49.699
um

90
00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.039
that's really worrisome um information.

91
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:55.369
Um Today is

92
00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:56.669
Vaccine Day.

93
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.570
Um which means that by the end of the day, people have to have been vaccinated,

94
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.149
proven that they're vaccinated,

95
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.100
uh

96
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.509
or gotten an exemption and a accommodation or they can't work tomorrow.

97
00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.339
And so,

98
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.339
uh leaders of hospitals and schools and uh

99
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.350
ems and long term care organizations today,

100
00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.829
I would call that the

101
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.230
hr employee health people are probably in a huge

102
00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.640
scramble today to try to get all this,

103
00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:24.700
this finished.

104
00:04:25.109 --> 00:04:29.410
Um We don't have new data about how many hospital employees are vaccinated.

105
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.869
We will resurvey our members um likely the week of the 25th, we may,

106
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.510
we're gonna consult with our members to see if they

107
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.660
would rather just wait till the first week of November.

108
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.619
Um But in the next couple of weeks, we will, we will resurvey.

109
00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:48.059
There is some con you know, last week we reported that we had 88% staff vaccinated 12%

110
00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:50.359
a combination of things.

111
00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:52.119
Um either partially vaccinated,

112
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.070
had applied for an exemption and it hadn't yet been reviewed or approved, um,

113
00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:57.179
or decided on

114
00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:59.519
or they hadn't turned in their forms

115
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.109
and there has been some movement in that number

116
00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:05.350
where people who were in that 12% have either

117
00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:07.220
moved to partially vaccinated.

118
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.980
Some of the partially vaccinated folks have gotten their

119
00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:12.190
second shot or may have completed their two weeks.

120
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.429
Um,

121
00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:13.589
and then finally,

122
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.359
people who ha had been vaccinated a long time ago who hadn't

123
00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:19.299
yet turned in their cards and so they're turning in their cards,

124
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:20.130
which is great.

125
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.839
Um So, so they're getting ve

126
00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:27.130
uh verification. So there's been um I think a lot of activity at the end of last week

127
00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:29.730
um over the weekend and probably till the end of today.

128
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.239
Um So tomorrow will be the first day that really impacts us.

129
00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:33.989
Um

130
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.809
We do continue to have concerns for sure about

131
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.109
long term care and um the first responders,

132
00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.019
the ambulance and fire,

133
00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:45.970
um what we hear is that their vaccine rates

134
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.480
are potentially lower than the hospital vaccine rates.

135
00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:49.679
And so that can, that

136
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.790
has the potential to be to create kind of a

137
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.160
cascading impact um across hospitals that patients can't get to the hospital or

138
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.540
can't be transported to a hospital where they need to move or um if

139
00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:03.429
long term care can't accept patients who need to leave the hospital and

140
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.500
we've seen an increase in the those patients who are difficult to discharge.

141
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.339
So those are the things that were, that are on our mind today

142
00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:15.239
and I think um Doctor Dillard, I'll start with you for the um you know,

143
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.970
what are you all seeing in the VAC, how's the vaccine?

144
00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.769
Um

145
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.200
uh working at

146
00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.859
medicine?

147
00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:22.239
And what did you see over the last, the end of the week,

148
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.209
at the beginning in this weekend?

149
00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.809
Great. No, thank you. Uh Cassie.

150
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.839
Um You know, and again, I just wanna emphasize,

151
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.690
we very much are in support of the

152
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.510
requirement that all healthcare workers be vaccinated.

153
00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:33.529
We need to

154
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.339
maintain a safe environment for our patients and our staff.

155
00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:42.029
At the same time, the last couple of weeks, coming up to the 18th, have been very uh

156
00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:44.179
um anxiety ridden.

157
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.109
I think for our teams, a lot of work by our hr personnel, by our employee health teams.

158
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.679
Uh and we want everyone to be vaccinated.

159
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.760
We don't want to lose any of our valued workers. Although at the end of the day,

160
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.160
uh there are gonna be people who unfortunately

161
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.179
no longer will be with our organization.

162
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.399
Uh after today.

163
00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:03.630
Uh We, when you look at our staff,

164
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.950
our medical staff and our trainees are at roughly 99% vaccinated.

165
00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:10.100
So we're extremely happy with that

166
00:07:10.359 --> 00:07:14.739
uh number at the same time, it means that we probably have about 220 staff

167
00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:18.859
uh who won't be with us uh after today. And that's impactful.

168
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:22.079
It's impactful for them, it's impactful for their colleagues.

169
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.540
Uh And so again, it's something that, uh on one hand,

170
00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:28.049
we're very pleased with our vaccination rates, but this is

171
00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.420
a lot of work.

172
00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:32.480
Uh And I don't think when the governor put in the proclamation,

173
00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:34.500
perhaps we had anticipated

174
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.100
all of the logistical challenges of getting this implemented

175
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.859
uh by uh today.

176
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.470
And do you wanna, uh doctor,

177
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.649
do you wanna talk any about what you're seeing as far as cases and trends and, uh,

178
00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:52.660
and death rates in within the UD medicine system?

179
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.679
Yeah, within our uh hospitals. Uh Today, we have, I believe, roughly uh 54 patients

180
00:07:59.859 --> 00:08:02.320
uh across our four hospital campuses.

181
00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:04.820
So as Cassie mentioned that has come down,

182
00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:08.420
but it's kind of plateaued in that 50 to 60 range.

183
00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:12.130
Uh and of those uh 23 are within the IC U.

184
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.220
So we still have many uh critically ill patients.

185
00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:17.529
The overall mortality rate for someone being

186
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.230
admitted to our hospitals is around 21%.

187
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.540
Again, the majority of those within the IC U.

188
00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:27.399
But that's one in five individuals with COVID-19 who are admitted to the hospital,

189
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.040
unfortunately die uh from that disease.

190
00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:33.469
And so it is having that impact, I think as Cassie mentioned,

191
00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:37.080
we were 21 months into this pandemic. I think there's

192
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.400
almost a numbness

193
00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:40.695
or an unfortunate tolerance uh

194
00:08:40.844 --> 00:08:43.075
to seeing these numbers every day.

195
00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:45.015
Whereas early in the pandemic,

196
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:49.174
uh they really struck a chord with the community and I think it just

197
00:08:49.364 --> 00:08:53.494
shows the prolonged nature of this pandemic and the impact that it's having.

198
00:08:53.505 --> 00:08:55.984
But we can't lose sight of the impact that each of

199
00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:59.864
those deaths has uh not only on uh their families,

200
00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:01.315
but really our entire community.

201
00:09:03.429 --> 00:09:04.130
Thank you,

202
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.979
Riza, love to hear from you about what you're experiencing the tricities.

203
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.580
Yeah, very similar to, to elsewhere.

204
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.739
We have seen our hospitalization numbers uh come down

205
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.109
but still uh

206
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.229
you know, for a hospital our size.

207
00:09:18.239 --> 00:09:22.690
So we run an average census anywhere around 2 4200 and 50 patients.

208
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.700
Uh We had seen back in September when we were getting really nervous

209
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.789
and we were quite gridlocked as many as 85 COVID positive patients.

210
00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:33.429
So, you know, um a third of our census

211
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.460
um

212
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.119
with COVID, uh we're down into the thirties now most days.

213
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.580
So today we've got 30 COVID positives uh in the hospital. I'm very pleased to see that

214
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.260
having come down so much,

215
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.460
but it's still not as low as it was even uh this past spring before the,

216
00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:50.359
the uh late summer surge started.

217
00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:51.650
So hoping to see that

218
00:09:51.909 --> 00:09:53.299
continue to come down

219
00:09:53.549 --> 00:09:57.789
uh over the course of the pandemic. I, I can tell you for us we've had um a

220
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.479
little over 3200 hospitalizations here for COVID. So

221
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:03.030
uh with all the ups and downs,

222
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.390
that's what's come our way.

223
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.909
Um About 260 have passed away in our hospital. So that's

224
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.289
uh folks who are uh staff and team have, um,

225
00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:14.469
unfortunately had to help say goodbye to

226
00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:17.590
without families present for most of those,

227
00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:18.880
or at least only virtually.

228
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.099
And that's been probably the biggest challenge we

229
00:10:21.109 --> 00:10:23.210
continue to hear about from our staff is,

230
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.190
uh, the amount of, uh, emotional burden,

231
00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:30.900
uh, that they're carrying on behalf of families and others who are unable to,

232
00:10:30.909 --> 00:10:35.219
unfortunately have visitation at the level that we had pre panic.

233
00:10:36.109 --> 00:10:36.570
Um,

234
00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:38.679
you know, the numbers in the tricities here

235
00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:40.770
in eastern Washington are still fairly high.

236
00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.549
I haven't looked at the the latest, uh through the weekend but,

237
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.750
uh, very pleased though that the hospitalizations have at least come down.

238
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.150
But as you've heard from other facilities to some of

239
00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:53.539
our ability to open up census tragically has been through

240
00:10:53.549 --> 00:10:56.830
more deaths that have sped up more recently and have

241
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.640
been in younger and younger patients in the past,

242
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.090
um, in the past few months.

243
00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.090
So, uh, pleased to see the numbers coming down,

244
00:11:04.099 --> 00:11:07.429
but I still have a long way to go until we're out of the woods with this.

245
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.799
We have been able to take a little more by way of transfers of patients coming in.

246
00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:13.409
Finally, we were quite gridlocked,

247
00:11:13.419 --> 00:11:16.659
as I mentioned in September when we had our census in the eighties and

248
00:11:16.789 --> 00:11:19.289
uh very low staffing with the number of our staff that

249
00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:22.890
were out uh isolating due to COVID exposure or other things.

250
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.419
But that

251
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.390
uh situation is starting to open up a little bit, uh,

252
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.609
which is helpful and then looking into the

253
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.809
rest of the year hoping that, um,

254
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.140
Thanksgiving and Christmas New Year don't bring another surge and

255
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.809
that we continue going in the direction that we've been,

256
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.140
uh, as far as staffing and uh, vaccinations and all those we're doing pretty well.

257
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.750
We are well above 90% compliant,

258
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.739
either through vaccination or through appropriate exemptions at this point.

259
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.119
Uh, the vast majority um through being vaccinated. So

260
00:11:51.309 --> 00:11:51.840
um

261
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.500
that looks very positive.

262
00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.429
I would say the unfortunate thing that maybe is missing in that as

263
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.369
we look at that data is the number of folks that we've lost

264
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.900
prior to this. Uh folks that knew that there was

265
00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:03.169
a,

266
00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:07.500
a vaccine requirement coming and maybe chose to either leave health

267
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.109
care or go somewhere where they thought maybe the the mandates

268
00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:12.229
would be a little different.

269
00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:12.530
And of course,

270
00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:15.609
we know what's happening in the future with some of the federal mandates.

271
00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:17.130
So that may be harder to do. But

272
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.750
if you look at the number of staff that we've lost this year,

273
00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:25.950
uh We lost nearly a quarter of our IC U staff uh through through this year

274
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.669
and we've replaced some of those positions and

275
00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.909
we have some travelers we've been able to fill

276
00:12:30.289 --> 00:12:32.150
but other key positions like that.

277
00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:35.719
I I think as we focus on what's going to happen with the vaccine mandate, now,

278
00:12:35.729 --> 00:12:38.960
I'm less worried about this than what's happened in the many months

279
00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:42.609
preceding and the amount of turnover and vacancies we're now trying to fill

280
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.849
and everyone's in the same situation with the hospitals,

281
00:12:45.859 --> 00:12:49.719
largely all competing with each other now across the country for a staff.

282
00:12:49.729 --> 00:12:52.710
And you've heard about all the travel contracts and what not going on.

283
00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.619
Um So that, that's about where we are,

284
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.590
but overall feeling optimistic that we're headed in the right direction,

285
00:12:57.599 --> 00:13:00.080
we just like to keep heading there faster and uh

286
00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:01.179
move through this.

287
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:03.669
And would you,

288
00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:05.539
do you think that some of that departure of

289
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:07.539
IC U staff is what you were describing earlier,

290
00:13:07.549 --> 00:13:08.109
the the

291
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.630
accumulated grief of having to um lose so many patients

292
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.070
and have them not have their families with them.

293
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.059
That's part of it. I think it's a variety of things.

294
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.960
It's uh certainly that's a part of it.

295
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.330
I think there's a few who have tried and now these very

296
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.229
lucrative travel assignments that folks that are mobile and flexible can take.

297
00:13:26.239 --> 00:13:27.640
We've lost a few that have

298
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.419
looked to do those and some that have,

299
00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:31.960
that have tried that and come back quite honestly.

300
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.650
Uh I think those are a little bit harder and more challenging.

301
00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:37.520
Maybe, maybe sometimes some people understand and then

302
00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:39.619
others who have left for other reasons,

303
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.119
maybe they were getting closer to retirement and

304
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.900
decided that this was a good time to,

305
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.580
to do something different and some who have stayed

306
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.890
in the hospital, but just wanted to move out of the IC U because of that.

307
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.489
And um, and the same is true with other, other departments too.

308
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.349
We've had turnover for a whole host of different reasons.

309
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.690
But the pandemic in one way, shape or form usually is, is part of that.

310
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:01.989
Thank you,

311
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.260
Doctor

312
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.059
Carter.

313
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.210
I guess that the view from Moses Lake.

314
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.510
Yeah. And I was listening to Doctor

315
00:14:08.929 --> 00:14:11.869
Khalil and it's remarkable to me that although we're just a

316
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:15.659
50 bed hospital here in the middle of um central Washington,

317
00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:17.299
our story is very similar to Doctor Khalil

318
00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:22.270
down in Cadillac. So or maybe not surprising given that we're fairly close. So

319
00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:27.390
um here in Moses Lake, uh we are also very happy that we kind of got out of September,

320
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.609
which was a very dark month for us.

321
00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.090
Uh We had better ability to

322
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:33.109
um

323
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.729
transfer patients to larger facilities as Doctor Khalil

324
00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:36.590
mentioned.

325
00:14:36.729 --> 00:14:40.659
However, even in our smaller hospital here, um we,

326
00:14:40.669 --> 00:14:42.500
our census is higher than it's ever been.

327
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.880
So our COVID patients thankfully have gone from the mid

328
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.390
twenties on a daily basis to the mid teens.

329
00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:52.969
However, we still overcapacity on a daily basis with our hospital census,

330
00:14:52.979 --> 00:14:53.809
we have very

331
00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:55.869
sick patients, high acuity.

332
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.909
Um so even non COVID, our I 12 bed IC U is full on a daily basis. Our

333
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.880
26 bed med surgeon is full on a daily basis.

334
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.309
We're boarding patients um in the emergency department,

335
00:15:07.599 --> 00:15:09.650
we've experienced very similar

336
00:15:09.789 --> 00:15:10.489
um

337
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:16.179
staffing issues. Um prior to this last week, we'd only lost seven

338
00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:19.890
employees that would specifically state it was because of the vaccine mandate.

339
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.960
Um However, we rely fairly heavily on staffing agencies where we're at.

340
00:15:24.969 --> 00:15:27.929
We don't have a huge pool of, of staff otherwise.

341
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.539
Um And with the cost of those staffing agency contracts, that is, um,

342
00:15:32.809 --> 00:15:34.179
it's hurting us a little bit.

343
00:15:34.299 --> 00:15:35.830
Um And then this last week,

344
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.729
we lost almost our entire materials management department

345
00:15:38.969 --> 00:15:41.940
um because specifically to the mandate,

346
00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:46.950
um we've had a fairly large rise in um people who have decided to retire.

347
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.150
Um And then doctor like Doctor Khalil

348
00:15:49.409 --> 00:15:49.989
said,

349
00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:52.349
um a fairly large number of people that have chose

350
00:15:52.359 --> 00:15:54.750
to travel or move to other states where they,

351
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.179
they may be believed that there was not gonna be a mandate in place.

352
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:04.390
Um Over the course of 2021 we've had 23 deaths from um

353
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.909
COVID, which does not seem like a lot.

354
00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:07.309
But again,

355
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320
imagine our census is much smaller than some

356
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.200
of these larger facilities we're talking to.

357
00:16:11.549 --> 00:16:14.440
Um And September was um a month that was

358
00:16:14.729 --> 00:16:15.359
um

359
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:21.010
harder for us, harder for our staff. We were losing um multiple patients a week.

360
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.609
Um And then just like Doctor

361
00:16:22.719 --> 00:16:22.809
Khalil

362
00:16:22.909 --> 00:16:23.210
said,

363
00:16:23.219 --> 00:16:27.190
we had many staff out so staffing issues with those um

364
00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:30.570
because of either exposure to COVID or positive COVID rates.

365
00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:31.450
Um

366
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.099
So a very difficult month for us, we were happy to see October.

367
00:16:35.109 --> 00:16:37.380
Although the anxiety that came with the um

368
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:42.080
impending October 18th date has also been very stressful for our staff

369
00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:46.549
for vaccines. We also are in compliance with the mandate.

370
00:16:46.559 --> 00:16:48.070
Um And again,

371
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.809
we've had a little bit of a a rush the last several um days and over the weekend,

372
00:16:53.059 --> 00:16:54.270
um today,

373
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.390
everybody's uh running around fairly frantically making sure

374
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.809
everything is in order ready for midnight tonight.

375
00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:01.440
Um But overall, our,

376
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.630
our meth message has always been educate and continue to encourage.

377
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.939
So um even our employees who are

378
00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:08.579
in the process,

379
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:13.160
us with just one vaccine or um have chosen a an exemption of some sort

380
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.000
and been granted that we continue to

381
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:17.319
educate and encourage vaccines across the board.

382
00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.800
Um And then our big hope for this week is um vaccines for the younger Children.

383
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.160
So we're looking forward to that.

384
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:29.349
Can you doctor Carter? Can you tell folks what materials management means?

385
00:17:29.819 --> 00:17:31.150
-- You said you're sure.
-- So,

386
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.979
so it's basically our warehouse.

387
00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:37.069
So the people making sure that we have the supplies that we need to keep functioning.

388
00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:37.560
So,

389
00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:38.979
uh when we were,

390
00:17:39.239 --> 00:17:41.170
I mean, that's really the, the sum of it.

391
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.869
Um I think about the beginning of the, the,

392
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.770
the COVID pandemic when we were looking for masks and P pe and

393
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.209
um just keeping everybody supplied.

394
00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:51.609
If we didn't have materials management,

395
00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:53.530
I don't even know who would have done that job.

396
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.099
So,

397
00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:54.729
um

398
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.349
it's hard to keep things stock when you don't

399
00:17:57.359 --> 00:18:00.689
have people purchasing and delivering and stocking our shelves.

400
00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:05.060
That, that is one of the things that we know is that even in hospitals that have a

401
00:18:05.339 --> 00:18:08.189
high rate of vaccine among their clinical staff,

402
00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:12.040
they may have some of those supportive staff, you know, folks in accounting or

403
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:12.869
um

404
00:18:13.199 --> 00:18:14.650
uh supply chain that,

405
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.660
that could have a real impact on the functioning of the hospital.

406
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.380
So that's some of the things that the hospital leaders are sorting through

407
00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:22.910
uh over the we'll be sorting through over the next week.

408
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.670
All right, Doctor mcdonald, um we just heard about the vaccines,

409
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.920
a little men of the vaccines for kids, um

410
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.500
which we're all really looking forward to.

411
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.329
Uh

412
00:18:33.489 --> 00:18:37.859
-- Thanks
-- Cassie. Yes, we are very excited about

413
00:18:38.329 --> 00:18:41.880
when the FDA will approve for emergency authorization

414
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.109
use of vaccine in our younger Children.

415
00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:44.380
And

416
00:18:44.579 --> 00:18:50.640
we are ready to um work with the pediatric community to get

417
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.540
um that vaccine out as soon as we hear the announcement.

418
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.099
So very excited about that

419
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:59.250
uh in terms of what's happening um

420
00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.050
in the pediatric community at Seattle Children's.

421
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.050
Fortunately,

422
00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.430
we've not seen the large numbers of COVID positive patients

423
00:19:07.459 --> 00:19:10.930
in in our hospital compared to our adult colleagues.

424
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:16.530
So uh approximately anywhere from 3 to 15 patients have

425
00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.069
been admitted at one time with COVID uh positive um

426
00:19:21.229 --> 00:19:22.280
testing.

427
00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:27.290
And uh in August, we saw more of those in the adolescence.

428
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.130
Uh and but in September,

429
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.150
we've seen younger Children um admitted with COVID disease.

430
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.699
So

431
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.030
very concerning

432
00:19:35.579 --> 00:19:40.530
our workforce right now is approximately 98% fully vaccinated.

433
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.390
And that's across um our whole uh workforce. Um

434
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.589
not just the clinical workforce

435
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.000
and uh approximately 1%

436
00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:52.030
are, have been,

437
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.380
um at least partially vaccinated and we're waiting

438
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.439
for that time when they're fully vaccinated.

439
00:19:57.209 --> 00:20:01.930
And the final 1% are those that uh submitted exemptions

440
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.050
and we're working hard to uh try to accommodate

441
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.260
as much of as many of those as possible.

442
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.599
We have not wanted to lose any of our workforce. So,

443
00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.979
but unfortunately, as uh Doctor Dalet

444
00:20:15.199 --> 00:20:19.750
mentioned, um some will need to go on uh administrative leave,

445
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.939
but we're really trying to work with every individual

446
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.459
as much as possible to see what we can do to keep them with us.

447
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:36.170
Thank you. Is there any update Doctor mcdowell to the timeline for kids, the 5 to 11

448
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.229
or what's, what's your, what if you had to guess? What's your best guess?

449
00:20:39.869 --> 00:20:41.750
-- I,
-- I am really hoping

450
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.160
November

451
00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:46.020
uh early November would be um

452
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.030
it would be fantastic if it would be before the end of this month,

453
00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.650
but uh we're ready to go when it happens.

454
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.189
Um So let's just hope that the FDA approves it as soon as possible.

455
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.599
And I know the federal government is working on allowing um pre

456
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.750
orders of the vaccine in anticipation of in, in hopes of its approval.

457
00:21:08.699 --> 00:21:09.849
Um Exactly

458
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:10.900
great.

459
00:21:11.219 --> 00:21:11.479
And I,

460
00:21:11.489 --> 00:21:14.920
I wanna also highlight something Doctor mcdonald said which is that many

461
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.560
hospitals rather than terminating staff are putting them on leave if they're,

462
00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:21.390
if they're not compliant with the vaccine

463
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.300
mandate, um,

464
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.439
in hopes that they will change and get vaccinated because it's

465
00:21:27.449 --> 00:21:30.160
a lot easier to bring someone back from leave than,

466
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:30.959
um,

467
00:21:31.479 --> 00:21:34.619
having to go if they've been terminated to go through the rehire process.

468
00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.689
So that's, I don't know that every hi, are all of you doing that or some of,

469
00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:38.859
is it kind of a mixture

470
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.040
we're doing that?

471
00:21:42.239 --> 00:21:45.599
You know, we're putting, uh, individuals who have started the process.

472
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.839
Uh, so if they've started their vaccine, but won't be fully vaccinated,

473
00:21:49.989 --> 00:21:54.949
uh, say they got one dose, uh, this last week or two, then they could go on, uh,

474
00:21:54.959 --> 00:21:58.430
administrative leave, uh, until they are compliant.

475
00:21:58.709 --> 00:22:00.060
Similarly, those who, uh,

476
00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:03.339
received a denial of an exemption request have

477
00:22:03.349 --> 00:22:06.619
essentially 45 days to come into compliance.

478
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.219
And so they could also be on leave during that period of time.

479
00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:13.670
Right. And there's some folks who have a time, limited medical exemption as well.

480
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.569
For example, if they've had COVID and got monoclonal antibodies,

481
00:22:16.579 --> 00:22:19.930
you can't be vaccinated until that until the 90 days post.

482
00:22:19.939 --> 00:22:21.109
And so they may be on

483
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.750
a, a medical exemption, but it has an expiration date.

484
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.699
All right. We are, um, happy to take questions.

485
00:22:28.709 --> 00:22:30.670
I don't see any in the chat um, yet,

486
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.030
but please put some in the chat or go ahead and speak up if you've got questions,

487
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:40.780
I apologize.

488
00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.969
This is Jessa mcintyre with box 13 in Seattle and I,

489
00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:45.819
I missed the opening comments there.

490
00:22:45.829 --> 00:22:47.560
That is a user error. Um

491
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.229
So I,

492
00:22:49.479 --> 00:22:52.930
-- I
-- just wanted to revisit this is probably already discussed. Um,

493
00:22:52.939 --> 00:22:53.869
but um

494
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:58.030
where the hospitalized, I know that the data probably won't come in for a few weeks.

495
00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.760
-- But where is your confidence in your ability to
-- retain most of your

496
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:01.310
staff?

497
00:23:02.689 --> 00:23:04.989
Um Everyone can answer this, uh, directly.

498
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:12.229
What we estimate statewide is that we will lose between two and 5% of hospital staff.

499
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:17.869
That actually may be honestly a high estimate from what we heard over the weekend.

500
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.510
Um,

501
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.489
because we heard that there were people who, uh,

502
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.609
moved to getting starting their vaccination series and,

503
00:23:25.619 --> 00:23:29.349
and then surpri surprisingly, I mean, I think this is like great news,

504
00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:32.540
but also probably makes the hr people tear their hair out.

505
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.260
There's a number of people who are,

506
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.839
were fully vaccinated and they were fully vaccinated, you know,

507
00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:39.060
months and months ago,

508
00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:40.709
it just hadn't gotten around to turning in their

509
00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:42.609
cards and they turned in their cards on,

510
00:23:42.619 --> 00:23:43.979
you know, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

511
00:23:43.989 --> 00:23:46.410
So there's some, uh, that, that's, uh, I mean,

512
00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.180
that's the greatest thing to find out that people actually are vaccinated.

513
00:23:49.189 --> 00:23:49.439
But

514
00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:51.290
that's, they, they probably were put,

515
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.800
they were put in the estimate estimate of unvaccinated, but they were vaccinated.

516
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.640
So other folks wanna share your confidence kind of how you're feeling about that.

517
00:23:59.790 --> 00:23:59.819
Ok.

518
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:08.130
We're pretty confident that, um, at this point, our numbers are pretty stable.

519
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.050
We don't think we're going to lose anybody tomorrow.

520
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.900
Yeah, as I mentioned, uh, earlier, um,

521
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.020
you know, I, I think we'll lose less than 1%.

522
00:24:20.079 --> 00:24:21.140
Uh, unfortunately,

523
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.640
right now there are about 220 of our staff who are not in compliance.

524
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.520
Uh, and so, unless something changes, such as they start their vaccination today,

525
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.900
uh they will be separated from us tomorrow.

526
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.770
We have a fairly small number that that's at risk just to repeat that again.

527
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.050
And my,

528
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.020
my bigger concern that I mentioned earlier in

529
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.280
the opening comments was more along the lines of

530
00:24:46.589 --> 00:24:49.260
the number of staff that we've already lost a year to date for

531
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.670
various reasons and uh kind of where that puts us going forward.

532
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.439
But the, the change as of today going in tomorrow,

533
00:24:55.449 --> 00:24:58.579
we don't think is gonna incrementally add a large number to that.

534
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:06.040
And we expect that we will have some that go on administrative leave,

535
00:25:06.219 --> 00:25:12.599
-- but we're really working hard to um really minimize that um across our
-- workforce.

536
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.180
When you look at the reports out of New York and California,

537
00:25:17.709 --> 00:25:20.189
there are a lot of folks who move from

538
00:25:20.349 --> 00:25:23.859
not, I mean, I mean, not there's still people who lost their, lost their jobs.

539
00:25:23.869 --> 00:25:26.500
There are also a substantial number of people who move from

540
00:25:26.739 --> 00:25:28.910
leave to starting the vaccine process.

541
00:25:28.939 --> 00:25:31.819
Um So we're hopeful that will be the case as well.

542
00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:33.160
Um

543
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.579
Is a question about uh

544
00:25:35.729 --> 00:25:38.939
so Kate, let me know if that answered your question about uh how,

545
00:25:38.949 --> 00:25:40.260
how many your question was,

546
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.040
do any of the hospital leaders on the call and know how many,

547
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.939
if any people will be dismissed tomorrow?

548
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.420
Um Doctor Carter, do you have any specific numbers of how many folks you think will,

549
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.130
will leave?

550
00:25:49.719 --> 00:25:52.060
I guess you're, you're putting folks on leave, right? So you're not.

551
00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:54.819
-- So,
-- so um

552
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.369
I would say the same thing Doctor

553
00:25:57.469 --> 00:25:57.609
Khalil

554
00:25:57.709 --> 00:25:59.930
said we've had a fair amount of loss over the course of

555
00:25:59.939 --> 00:26:03.939
the year because of um early retirements or choosing to move away.

556
00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:07.959
But um the difference between today and tomorrow really, um

557
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.479
I, we don't anticipate a big number between today and tomorrow.

558
00:26:12.699 --> 00:26:13.869
Great. Thank you.

559
00:26:14.449 --> 00:26:18.170
Um Are rural hospitals still going to be hardest impacted by the vaccine mandate?

560
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.900
Yes.

561
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:20.469
Um rural eastern Washington,

562
00:26:20.479 --> 00:26:23.160
especially rural Western Washington is actually in better shape.

563
00:26:23.469 --> 00:26:27.680
Um Not that's not a fully across the board, but, you know, communities like

564
00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:31.719
Port Townsend, um they've got a higher vaccination rate than um

565
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.939
than some of the eastern Washington communities,

566
00:26:34.739 --> 00:26:34.869
you know,

567
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.469
go ahead.

568
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:36.849
Ok.

569
00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.069
I

570
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.750
was just gonna add, you know, I think even though we look at some of the,

571
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.979
the smaller hospitals,

572
00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:44.349
rural hospitals that may potentially be

573
00:26:44.359 --> 00:26:48.420
individually harder uh impacted ultimately though

574
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.310
uh our state is so interconnected with respect to the healthcare system,

575
00:26:52.609 --> 00:26:55.170
uh that any loss impacts all of us.

576
00:26:55.359 --> 00:26:59.910
Because if we have a reduction in services in one area or reduction in beds

577
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.869
in an area, it impacts all of us as we've seen,

578
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.780
given the overall capacity constraints.

579
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:05.280
And so

580
00:27:05.469 --> 00:27:08.550
that's one of the things that we're really looking at as well.

581
00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.849
And we have to think about how is this across

582
00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:14.050
the state and almost thinking of us as one system.

583
00:27:14.229 --> 00:27:16.699
Uh when we look at the impact of this mandate

584
00:27:16.709 --> 00:27:19.910
uh here uh going forward because as others have said,

585
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.069
we're all stretched uh from a staffing uh standpoint.

586
00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:26.630
And so any impact anywhere within our state is gonna

587
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.959
have at least a ripple effect across the state.

588
00:27:32.209 --> 00:27:32.790
Thank you.

589
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.430
Um

590
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.390
ok.

591
00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.790
Uh What are the contingency plans for hiring

592
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.869
more workers to replace those who are leaving,

593
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:43.150
especially the rural hospitals that are losing a greater percentage?

594
00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.910
Um I'll make some comments and invite others to come in as well.

595
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.430
Everybody's looking for staff.

596
00:27:48.439 --> 00:27:52.770
So whether it's trying to hire new staff or traveler contracts or

597
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:56.349
um there's another question about the federal resources coming into hospitals.

598
00:27:56.359 --> 00:27:58.310
There is potentially there,

599
00:27:58.319 --> 00:28:01.239
there should be some staff resources that are available to hospitals.

600
00:28:01.819 --> 00:28:02.349
Um

601
00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.280
Everyone is looking and trying to fill those, those places.

602
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:10.849
We will see a, a curtailing of services. There's no question about that.

603
00:28:10.859 --> 00:28:14.569
Um People are going to cap it as Doctor Della just described,

604
00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:17.719
there's gonna be caps on admissions in some rural hospitals there's

605
00:28:17.729 --> 00:28:23.199
going to be um closing down of some service lines potentially or

606
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.280
um

607
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.219
having people have to wait longer for elective

608
00:28:27.229 --> 00:28:29.979
or non urgent procedures or for outpatient services.

609
00:28:29.989 --> 00:28:33.729
So there that it's both a goal to hire more staff,

610
00:28:33.739 --> 00:28:37.010
but also to figure out how do you reconfigure services in a

611
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.260
way that you can cover it with the staff that you've got.

612
00:28:40.189 --> 00:28:42.729
Anybody else wanna comment on that things that strategies you're

613
00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:44.770
using to cover for the staff that have gone.

614
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.750
Unfortunately, Moses Lake just like other places.

615
00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.689
Um We've had to reduce our services in our or

616
00:28:52.989 --> 00:28:56.729
um and some of that is hospital bed availability. Some of that is staffing.

617
00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:59.239
We have to use those valuable nurses and other places

618
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.250
in the hospital to take care of acutely ill people.

619
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.410
Um We,

620
00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:06.319
we earlier in the year did set up in the clinic

621
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:10.589
at least um ma apprenticeships to help build our MA program.

622
00:29:10.609 --> 00:29:15.170
We have a, a nursing school of nursing school and an ma school here in town.

623
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:19.930
Thankfully. So we have nurse tech programs in the er to help build that supply.

624
00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:20.790
Um

625
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.505
Our CNO has developed a, a buddy program if you will.

626
00:29:24.515 --> 00:29:26.354
So if we can borrow from the clinic and bring him into

627
00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:30.515
the hospital um and have them tasking with other licensed nurses.

628
00:29:30.574 --> 00:29:33.244
We had kind of gone away from using LP NS um

629
00:29:33.255 --> 00:29:35.655
and using MA S in our clinic and our hospital.

630
00:29:35.665 --> 00:29:41.114
But we now are um looking at L LP NS as um source resources for us.

631
00:29:41.324 --> 00:29:43.635
Um But unfortunately, I think you're right, Cassie.

632
00:29:43.645 --> 00:29:46.744
There comes a point where we just have to cap what we can

633
00:29:46.755 --> 00:29:49.734
do here at the hospital if we don't have the staffing to,

634
00:29:49.814 --> 00:29:50.834
to accommodate that.

635
00:29:53.229 --> 00:29:53.770
Thank you.

636
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:55.219
Um

637
00:29:56.189 --> 00:29:59.459
Whitney Ward sent a question saying explain more about

638
00:29:59.469 --> 00:30:01.410
how the reduction in services will impact Samaritan.

639
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.380
But I think that question

640
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.760
might have been coming in as Doctor Carter was speaking.

641
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.400
So if you need more information, will you put that back in the chat?

642
00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:09.770
I, I think that she answered that Doctor Carter,

643
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.890
anything else you would say about that?

644
00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:13.910
I think I answered it unless

645
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.520
I think, I think it was kind of a simultaneous, you know,

646
00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:17.939
you were speaking as the question was coming in.

647
00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:18.670
I believe

648
00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:20.180
um

649
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.890
Doctor Dett

650
00:30:21.069 --> 00:30:24.040
put in the chat that the um FD advisory committee

651
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.359
is meeting October 26th to review the data for Children.

652
00:30:26.369 --> 00:30:27.339
5 to 11 years old.

653
00:30:27.349 --> 00:30:29.349
I've been telling my 10 year old that this is going to be the

654
00:30:29.359 --> 00:30:31.199
best Halloween treat ever that he could

655
00:30:31.209 --> 00:30:33.219
potentially get vaccinated at Halloween week.

656
00:30:33.229 --> 00:30:34.020
He's very excited.

657
00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:35.930
Um

658
00:30:36.369 --> 00:30:40.979
Let's see, update on federal resources coming into hospitals. So,

659
00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:41.849
um

660
00:30:42.729 --> 00:30:43.079
Taa

661
00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.229
Riley, would you be willing to take this question?

662
00:30:45.239 --> 00:30:48.430
I think you're closer to what's happening with the AC I contract

663
00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.060
if you're still on, stay still on? Yep,

664
00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:53.750
I'm here.

665
00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.160
I honestly, I'm not sure if I've got a whole lot more than you do.

666
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:04.640
I know that um the hospitals are able to um apply right now and that Dey

667
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.449
has got a,

668
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.930
the Department of State Department of Health has a

669
00:31:07.939 --> 00:31:10.160
system that has been set up for that.

670
00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:11.430
Um

671
00:31:12.439 --> 00:31:17.489
And the other good news is that the state has secured um

672
00:31:17.599 --> 00:31:21.979
funding for COVID only um hospital care

673
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.709
that is provided um through

674
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.060
the agency staff from FEMA.

675
00:31:28.069 --> 00:31:31.459
So that's the other uh piece of good news about that contract.

676
00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.689
I don't know, Cassie, if that, I've got a whole lot more to share than that.

677
00:31:35.069 --> 00:31:39.569
I I know that a number quite a few hospitals have applied to the state for the staff.

678
00:31:39.579 --> 00:31:42.010
The tricky piece as Taa just described is that

679
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.119
in order to receive federal funding for the staff,

680
00:31:45.439 --> 00:31:46.380
they have to be

681
00:31:46.489 --> 00:31:48.859
doing only COVID care

682
00:31:49.219 --> 00:31:50.800
and so to have.

683
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.359
So the hospitals are trying to think about how

684
00:31:52.369 --> 00:31:54.959
can they manage having a staff person who comes,

685
00:31:54.989 --> 00:31:57.000
who, you know, is working in the IC U and is like,

686
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.229
can't touch someone who's there because they had a heart attack.

687
00:31:59.239 --> 00:32:01.069
They have, you know, they can only focus on the COVID patients.

688
00:32:01.079 --> 00:32:03.719
I think it's possible but it does make it um

689
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:10.369
less helpful to a rural hospital that might have, you know, only one COVID patient.

690
00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.239
Um for example, um but any have any of you applied for the

691
00:32:14.589 --> 00:32:15.099
uh

692
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.930
to be a site for the staff to go to the federal staff.

693
00:32:23.099 --> 00:32:23.760
No. OK.

694
00:32:24.699 --> 00:32:25.239
All right.

695
00:32:25.449 --> 00:32:25.949
Um

696
00:32:27.099 --> 00:32:29.959
So another question given the impacts we mentioned

697
00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:32.459
with some staff loss and curtailing of services.

698
00:32:32.849 --> 00:32:35.189
What do we say to people who argue that vaccine mandate

699
00:32:35.199 --> 00:32:38.410
should have given more wiggle room to avoid impacts to services?

700
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.030
I will say this has been

701
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:45.640
an incredibly thorny question. Um Among the hospital leadership in the state,

702
00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.319
two really important goals that we are facing here.

703
00:32:50.329 --> 00:32:55.520
One is we want as many staff as possible to be vaccinated. It protects the staff,

704
00:32:55.689 --> 00:32:56.939
it protects their patients.

705
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.400
And if you get an outbreak in a hospital, you the in this, you know,

706
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:06.099
you could end up quarantining a ton of staff, um impacting a ton of patients.

707
00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:09.160
And so you could actually cripple yourself more significantly.

708
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.260
But the other goal is to keep the health sys system functioning as much

709
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.729
as possible and to be able to serve as many people as possible.

710
00:33:15.739 --> 00:33:16.750
And those goals

711
00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:20.339
sometimes work together and sometimes they're in conflict. And so

712
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.619
um

713
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.500
we have maintained,

714
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:28.300
we have not requested changes to the vaccine mandate as an association.

715
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.699
We do have some members who would like to see changes, but it is not

716
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.459
um that's not been a consensus position among our membership.

717
00:33:35.469 --> 00:33:39.540
Um We've really been focusing on trying to help our hospitals as much as possible.

718
00:33:40.089 --> 00:33:42.430
Um implement the mandate. Uh

719
00:33:43.109 --> 00:33:45.849
do provide accommodations to those who receive exemptions,

720
00:33:45.859 --> 00:33:48.540
uh do good education of their

721
00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:50.540
staff. But it is, it's a,

722
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.839
uh it's a really tricky question.

723
00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:54.930
Um Anybody wanna comment on it,

724
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:02.229
you know, there's a lot of variables. I guess the one thing I, I would say is

725
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.089
prior to this, uh being mandated, we were,

726
00:34:06.099 --> 00:34:10.179
we were kind of capped out at a certain level of, of vaccination while it was

727
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.530
voluntary. Uh with all the things we were doing to try to get it

728
00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:15.719
higher, it was just not moving

729
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:19.280
and having the uh the mandate has really moved

730
00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.530
up our vaccine compliance as you've heard today.

731
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.530
Uh quite, quite a bit. So, I guess the question becomes, um,

732
00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:28.478
what's, what's the upside? What's the downside? I, I,

733
00:34:28.728 --> 00:34:33.270
yes, there are some, uh in our case, a small number of probably of folks, we may

734
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.070
lose due to the, due to the mandate.

735
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.438
But if we have a,

736
00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:39.688
a requisite number of folks that are kept

737
00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.879
safe and can stay in staffing because they're not

738
00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.850
at home isolating because they're avoiding getting sick and

739
00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.270
those kinds of things from a staffing perspective.

740
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:48.228
Um

741
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.438
Hopefully that will balance out and be a net positive for us.

742
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.030
And then,

743
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.780
uh just from the standpoint of believing that our workforce in

744
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.429
health care in order to protect the patients that we're serving

745
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.100
uh in here as well as themselves, should get vaccinated.

746
00:35:02.439 --> 00:35:02.820
Uh It,

747
00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:06.629
it certainly lines up with our organization's beliefs and where we're headed.

748
00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:09.899
So we'll, we'll see how the numbers play out. But I'm hopeful that

749
00:35:10.379 --> 00:35:11.810
the number of additional,

750
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.939
that we've uh managed to get vaccinated because of the mandate will help

751
00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:19.689
keep everybody safe and keep staffing actually stronger in the long run.

752
00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:27.340
You know, I agree. I think um there is a tension there as Cassie uh mentioned.

753
00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:30.260
At the same time, we know these vaccines are safe and effective.

754
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.739
If you look in King County,

755
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.790
uh if you are unvaccinated,

756
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.659
you have a ninefold greater likelihood of getting infected,

757
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:37.760
a 50 fold,

758
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:41.189
greater likelihood of being hospitalized and over a

759
00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:44.699
60 fold likelihood of dying from COVID-19.

760
00:35:45.229 --> 00:35:50.010
And as Cassie mentioned, we continue to have 15 to 20 deaths across the state uh

761
00:35:50.129 --> 00:35:51.409
each day

762
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.479
or I mean, each week. So this is something that we need

763
00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:55.830
to address.

764
00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.409
We feel very strongly that we have an obligation to create a safe environment

765
00:36:00.679 --> 00:36:03.030
for our patients, for our staff.

766
00:36:03.179 --> 00:36:06.800
We care for a lot of immunocompromised patients who often can't mount

767
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.530
uh an immune responsive the vaccine themselves.

768
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.219
We've seen outbreaks among our healthcare workers.

769
00:36:13.229 --> 00:36:16.340
Now, many of those are from acquisition within the community,

770
00:36:16.649 --> 00:36:19.300
but if they're infected there and then come back in

771
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.000
uh there is that risk of transmission to coworkers uh and patients.

772
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.459
And so we believe that we do need to keep a safe environment.

773
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.129
And when you look at the exemption request that we received,

774
00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:34.080
we received a little over 400

775
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:36.409
we approved about a third.

776
00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:40.929
But what was interesting is that of those who had their exemption

777
00:36:40.939 --> 00:36:44.449
request denied the majority went on to start the vaccination series.

778
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.110
And so overall,

779
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.290
we have seen this increase in vaccination rates through this mandate.

780
00:36:50.649 --> 00:36:51.429
Uh And again,

781
00:36:51.439 --> 00:36:55.580
we recognize the challenges and that tension particularly with staffing.

782
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.189
Uh But we really feel that this as uh Risa just said,

783
00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:01.219
it's in alignment with our values and our

784
00:37:01.229 --> 00:37:05.070
obligation as healthcare workers and healthcare organizations.

785
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:12.360
Uh I just wanna echo what uh what Tim said in, in our, in our hospital,

786
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.530
very, very vulnerable pediatric population, most of which are not vaccinated

787
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.129
and really excited to see,

788
00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:23.909
hopefully by the end of the month that the 5 to

789
00:37:23.919 --> 00:37:26.199
11 year olds will be able to start their vaccine.

790
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.969
But of all of those that are patients,

791
00:37:28.979 --> 00:37:31.729
many of them are immune compromised and we really

792
00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:34.770
feel strongly that we have to protect our patients,

793
00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:39.639
our families um and our workforce um from contracting COVID um

794
00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:40.419
disease.

795
00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:44.389
So it's really critical and I also wanna put in a uh

796
00:37:44.399 --> 00:37:47.729
mention that people should also get their flu vaccine this year.

797
00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:52.449
I'm really concerned that as more and more um people are out

798
00:37:52.459 --> 00:37:55.620
in the public that we will see a surge um of flu

799
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.780
um coming in the coming months

800
00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:02.239
and uh just really um just wanna double down on

801
00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.580
the nece the necessity of getting that vaccine as well.

802
00:38:10.129 --> 00:38:11.449
Any other comments about that?

803
00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.510
Um

804
00:38:14.699 --> 00:38:15.899
You know, I actually wanted to co

805
00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:17.270
doctor uh uh

806
00:38:17.899 --> 00:38:18.409
mcdonald.

807
00:38:18.419 --> 00:38:18.879
When you were talking,

808
00:38:18.889 --> 00:38:21.469
it reminded me of something you said earlier that we haven't seen

809
00:38:21.479 --> 00:38:24.699
the as high a pediatric cases as some other states have seen.

810
00:38:24.929 --> 00:38:25.840
And we wanna give,

811
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:30.590
I wanna give huge gratitude to our governor for having uh the rule

812
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.879
about you got to wear masks in schools and sticking to it.

813
00:38:32.889 --> 00:38:37.389
We find absolutely baffling other governors saying that you not only

814
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.969
like, like actively discouraging them wearing masks in schools. Um

815
00:38:42.209 --> 00:38:46.739
It is so nice to have kids go to school and feel like um there's a lot of, there's,

816
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.719
there are barriers of protection for them.

817
00:38:48.729 --> 00:38:49.199
Um

818
00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:52.070
So huge kudos to Governor Insley for that.

819
00:38:53.649 --> 00:38:58.040
Um ok, another question with staffing shortages, driving up wages and incentives

820
00:38:58.239 --> 00:38:59.909
for positions like travel nurses.

821
00:38:59.919 --> 00:39:02.879
It sounds like you're losing some folks to those higher paying travel positions.

822
00:39:03.129 --> 00:39:05.229
How do you create a long term solution to that?

823
00:39:05.909 --> 00:39:09.469
Um One thing that we are involved in um in partnership with the

824
00:39:09.479 --> 00:39:11.830
American Hospital Association is asking the Federal

825
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.479
Attorney General to look at the sta

826
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.000
travel staffing contracts because the prices are

827
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:21.610
just remarkably high and also how much of that money is going

828
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.979
directly to the workers versus um to the agencies. So

829
00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:28.370
it really is a national issue. It's happening all around the country.

830
00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:31.580
But other other thoughts about how to create a

831
00:39:31.729 --> 00:39:32.169
um

832
00:39:32.959 --> 00:39:35.070
long term solutions to that for folks who are

833
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.149
taking the higher paying travel positions and maybe,

834
00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:37.699
um, Risa,

835
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:39.959
you might comment on people coming back from travel

836
00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:41.790
contracts because I've heard that as well that like

837
00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.550
you go to a city, you don't know anybody. You're in

838
00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:44.709
a,

839
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.409
you know,

840
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.939
you're in some kind of like

841
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.179
temporary housing and you don't know the team and you don't know the hospital,

842
00:39:50.189 --> 00:39:51.560
you don't know how it works and

843
00:39:51.909 --> 00:39:54.770
it's, uh, we have heard for sure that some folks who have tried it,

844
00:39:54.879 --> 00:39:56.419
it turns out they don't really like it.

845
00:39:57.739 --> 00:40:01.530
Yeah, I think that's a tough gig for, for all the reasons you mentioned, Cassie and,

846
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.120
and for us.

847
00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:06.840
Uh and, and probably somewhere, I'm sure my colleagues on the call here today

848
00:40:07.399 --> 00:40:09.050
continuing to focus on all the things.

849
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.810
We've always tried to focus on having a,

850
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.899
having a great culture and having a um a place that people want to work and, you know,

851
00:40:14.909 --> 00:40:15.679
keeping our

852
00:40:15.919 --> 00:40:18.040
people that have been here for many years,

853
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:21.560
uh dedicated support in whatever ways we can knowing that it's been a challenge.

854
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.590
I think people are frustrated on a whole lot of different levels.

855
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.870
Uh probably at any organization they work with

856
00:40:26.975 --> 00:40:27.945
these days, but

857
00:40:28.135 --> 00:40:30.715
trying to really focus on

858
00:40:30.844 --> 00:40:33.665
caring for and retaining the people that we have here is

859
00:40:33.675 --> 00:40:37.834
uh really been our major focus and these travel uh positions.

860
00:40:37.844 --> 00:40:41.905
I know that the prices go up and down depending on the situation that that's going on.

861
00:40:41.915 --> 00:40:43.064
And, you know, as the,

862
00:40:43.225 --> 00:40:46.465
as the curve, the epidemiological curve starts to come down

863
00:40:46.745 --> 00:40:49.034
and things change. I expect that the um

864
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:52.000
the wages on those travel positions will start to come,

865
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:55.429
come down as well and be hopefully a little bit less um

866
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.629
tempting for folks. But there's no, no magic bullet to this.

867
00:40:58.639 --> 00:40:59.899
I think just trying to create

868
00:41:00.439 --> 00:41:03.770
as good of an environment as possible for folks in healthcare in general.

869
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.979
So that we have more people wanting to come into the workforce and be part of this.

870
00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:09.270
And it's still an amazing thing to be

871
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.820
part of and that people are intrinsically motivated

872
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:16.639
on so many levels to to be part of um hospitals and other healthcare organizations.

873
00:41:16.649 --> 00:41:16.979
So

874
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.659
I think it's all those things.

875
00:41:18.669 --> 00:41:19.540
And again, we,

876
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:23.094
we have a lot going on right now with people competing with sign on bonuses and

877
00:41:23.104 --> 00:41:26.604
all sorts of stuff all over the country trying to pull a staff here and there.

878
00:41:26.614 --> 00:41:27.665
But at some level,

879
00:41:27.675 --> 00:41:30.314
I'm sure folks like to be able to stay where they

880
00:41:30.324 --> 00:41:32.294
are and grow with a team that they are part of and

881
00:41:32.554 --> 00:41:35.135
we will all continue focusing on those things as well. So

882
00:41:35.304 --> 00:41:38.824
I don't think there's any silver bullet answer to this other than continue

883
00:41:38.834 --> 00:41:41.324
to focus on all the things that we know are the right things.

884
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:43.689
I think Risa

885
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:43.820
uh

886
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.770
made a really good point earlier on uh

887
00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.709
that I think that the overall staffing challenges,

888
00:41:49.719 --> 00:41:52.969
yes, there will be some impact from the mandate, but that's not the primary impact.

889
00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:55.389
The primary impact is the last 21 months

890
00:41:55.459 --> 00:41:58.120
of going through this pandemic and the exhaustion

891
00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.969
and fatigue uh that our staff are feeling.

892
00:42:01.429 --> 00:42:04.040
Um We've also from the mandate standpoint,

893
00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.850
had many staff who are actually pleased that we

894
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.070
are creating an environment that is safe for them.

895
00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:12.080
They want to work with individuals who are vaccinated

896
00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.770
and our patients are asking

897
00:42:13.919 --> 00:42:17.010
uh about the vaccination status of those caring for them.

898
00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:20.489
Uh So I think many people are actually very glad that

899
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:24.949
we are requiring uh vaccination uh within our facilities as well.

900
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.530
The bigger issue like Reza said is just how do we

901
00:42:27.929 --> 00:42:32.830
really support our people, the resilience and as we even come out of this pandemic,

902
00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.870
uh that's got to be our primary focus uh across all

903
00:42:35.879 --> 00:42:38.550
of our organizations is how would we best support our people?

904
00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:47.729
Ok, Risa, a question for you. Do you anticipate an increased census

905
00:42:47.979 --> 00:42:47.989
uh

906
00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.899
due to cutbacks at rural hospitals after the vaccine mandate.

907
00:42:50.909 --> 00:42:54.100
Do you think you're going to be receiving more patients out of rural hospitals?

908
00:42:55.379 --> 00:42:57.719
I think maybe and again, it comes down to the,

909
00:42:57.729 --> 00:43:00.750
to the numbers when we were back in September and we saw the

910
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.040
disease curve going this way.

911
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.949
And so our staffing curve going going the other way that obviously,

912
00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:08.370
it was not a great combination for, for anybody,

913
00:43:08.379 --> 00:43:13.449
but as we see the curve start to flatten and come down, uh at the same time, as,

914
00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:16.830
as I know, we are seeing some of these staffing challenges in rural hospitals.

915
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.959
It just depends on the degree to which those curves move in tandem. And

916
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.310
my hope is that the uh disease incidence continues to

917
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.929
come down even as some of those staffing challenges occur.

918
00:43:26.939 --> 00:43:30.729
That's certainly what we're, we're seeing here. Our staffing hasn't gotten um,

919
00:43:31.129 --> 00:43:31.969
that much better,

920
00:43:31.979 --> 00:43:35.909
but it has gotten a little bit better as we've seen the the disease incidents

921
00:43:35.919 --> 00:43:40.290
uh come down and we are able now to accept more of those transfers in.

922
00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.709
So I hope a combination of

923
00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:44.949
uh us being able to accept more if there is a need for it.

924
00:43:44.959 --> 00:43:46.620
And then in those rural communities,

925
00:43:46.629 --> 00:43:48.889
um their disease incidents starting to come down

926
00:43:48.899 --> 00:43:51.110
even as some of their staffing is challenged,

927
00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.590
um hopefully we will keep us pretty stable, but we'll see, we,

928
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.080
we need to be prepared if it does surge back up again.

929
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.189
And, and we certainly will

930
00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.479
thank you.

931
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:00.590
Um

932
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.719
are hospitals considering requiring an additional or booster

933
00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:05.479
dose for staff members in the future?

934
00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:08.379
And then maybe a correlator that I'll ask this question is,

935
00:44:08.389 --> 00:44:11.560
how many staff are you seeing voluntarily seeking out the booster,

936
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:12.260
the booster dose?

937
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.000
Are you tracking that?

938
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.469
And just to remind folks, it's only for pfizer.

939
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.760
So like I have, I have got the Moderna shot,

940
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:20.159
so I'm not currently eligible for a booster and um

941
00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:23.840
so that it's a, it's a subset of people who um

942
00:44:24.669 --> 00:44:26.169
who can get a booster right now.

943
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.219
We have no plans to require it currently,

944
00:44:32.229 --> 00:44:36.270
but we have seen a number of staff that are taking advantage of that that can and I,

945
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.889
I don't have any numbers to share, but I certainly encouraging those that can

946
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.850
to do that. But no, no plans to require it currently.

947
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.040
We've done.

948
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:45.810
Ok.

949
00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:46.600
Go ahead.

950
00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.389
We've had uh a pretty significant number of our staff

951
00:44:49.399 --> 00:44:52.320
that um were eligible to get the Pfizer booster.

952
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:56.729
Go ahead and, and get it. So our vaccine clinic has been relatively

953
00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:58.139
um full

954
00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.580
and um

955
00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.790
we are not requiring it though.

956
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.870
Uh It's still under an eu a and at some point in the future,

957
00:45:05.879 --> 00:45:08.270
um we very well may be requiring it

958
00:45:11.179 --> 00:45:12.659
di it. How about you? Anything different?

959
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.500
Uh No, I don't have uh numbers. And again, it's only those who got Pfizer um

960
00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:21.969
in terms of the booster and we haven't had conversations.

961
00:45:21.979 --> 00:45:25.100
I, I think we need to wait and see where things uh go.

962
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:29.070
Um Could it be that there's uh an annual need uh

963
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.090
for a Coronavirus vaccine just like there is with influenza potentially?

964
00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.070
I I think we're just not there yet in terms

965
00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.389
of us seeing the data got and what the recommendations from

966
00:45:39.629 --> 00:45:40.889
us that we see will be in the future.

967
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.919
Doctor Carter, anything you wanna add.

968
00:45:46.469 --> 00:45:48.239
Uh We're currently not requiring it,

969
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.399
but we have a fair amount of our um people who

970
00:45:50.409 --> 00:45:52.439
flies are eligible that have been in line to get it

971
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.080
and it sounds like there may be some more um booster possibilities,

972
00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:00.840
especially for Johnson and Johnson recipients in the next

973
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.199
couple of weeks. Doctor Dett,

974
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.919
any update you have about that.

975
00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:09.290
Well, the FDA uh advisory panel met last week.

976
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.110
And so I think both with Moderna and Johnson and Johnson,

977
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.459
I think they are coming out with recommendations

978
00:46:14.649 --> 00:46:17.050
uh for booster now goes through uh the

979
00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:20.090
advisory committee on immunization practices from the CDC.

980
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.784
And then ultimately, the CDC director, uh

981
00:46:22.175 --> 00:46:23.735
as we saw with Pfizer,

982
00:46:23.885 --> 00:46:26.774
uh the CDC director um uh had a

983
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.854
different recommendation than uh the advisory committee.

984
00:46:29.864 --> 00:46:30.294
So

985
00:46:30.435 --> 00:46:31.915
I think by the end of this week,

986
00:46:31.925 --> 00:46:35.205
we'll have a better sense uh in terms of potential boosters,

987
00:46:35.294 --> 00:46:38.024
uh both for Moderna and Johnson and Johnson

988
00:46:38.469 --> 00:46:41.889
and Johnson and Johnson, I'll just say, I don't know where this will end.

989
00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.070
Um But you know,

990
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.040
there's also a discussion of uh should that booster be with a second dose of

991
00:46:47.050 --> 00:46:51.290
Johnson and Johnson or should that second dose be with an MRN A vaccine?

992
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.129
Uh There's an NIH study that suggests that there may be a better

993
00:46:55.239 --> 00:46:57.629
immune response with an MRN A vaccine.

994
00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.060
Uh countries in Europe have experience with that,

995
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.520
particularly with the astrazeneca, which is analogous to the Johnson and Johnson.

996
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.989
So

997
00:47:04.159 --> 00:47:07.260
um I'm not sure where that's all gonna shake out uh yet.

998
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.350
Uh And so hopefully by the end of this week, we'll have some more clarity,

999
00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.699
but I would anticipate

1000
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.800
uh that both of those uh groups will be eligible for boosters.

1001
00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:18.419
It's just not entirely clear what the Johnson and Johnson,

1002
00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:21.310
will it only be for the Johnson and Johnson or will

1003
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.550
they allow an MRN a uh vaccine as the booster?

1004
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:26.719
Thank you.

1005
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.879
And um also I wanted to share some other information I was thinking about,

1006
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.199
about the pediatric vaccine,

1007
00:47:32.209 --> 00:47:35.939
which is that it's going to be packaged differently than the, the pediatric Pfizer.

1008
00:47:35.949 --> 00:47:37.280
It's gonna be packaged differently

1009
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.750
and it's a different strength. It's a third of the strength of the adult strength. Um

1010
00:47:42.389 --> 00:47:43.959
So it's, it's uh

1011
00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:46.969
you have to go to a place that has the pediatric

1012
00:47:46.979 --> 00:47:50.030
vaccine in order to get your 5 to 11 vaccinated.

1013
00:47:50.909 --> 00:47:53.010
So I assume Doctor mcdowell that Children will be

1014
00:47:53.209 --> 00:47:55.209
stocking in quite a bit of this vaccine.

1015
00:47:56.429 --> 00:48:01.570
Um Absolutely. And we will also be um having it at Odessa Brown

1016
00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:04.689
uh children's uh clinic um as well.

1017
00:48:04.699 --> 00:48:07.889
And so we will also wanna do our best to reach out to

1018
00:48:07.899 --> 00:48:11.669
the bio community f and that families and get those Children in.

1019
00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:12.169
So

1020
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:17.270
we expect that we'll be really active in promoting a vaccination and

1021
00:48:17.389 --> 00:48:19.889
working with the university um as well.

1022
00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:22.530
Um They've been really fantastic partners um uh

1023
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.409
for us in um vaccinating our community.

1024
00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:26.169
So, thank you.

1025
00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:29.620
I know lots of schools are working on this as well.

1026
00:48:29.629 --> 00:48:32.850
I've gotten this information from my kids schools but they're,

1027
00:48:32.989 --> 00:48:34.379
they're thinking about their vaccine clinic.

1028
00:48:35.159 --> 00:48:37.500
All right. That's all of our questions. Um,

1029
00:48:37.639 --> 00:48:42.100
uh, we are, one thing we didn't talk about was the federal vaccine mandate,

1030
00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.739
which we still don't have a date for.

1031
00:48:44.159 --> 00:48:49.500
Um, we were, we're expecting to receive the interim final rule.

1032
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.139
Um, I don't believe that's come out.

1033
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:53.489
Has anybody seen no one's seen a federal, the federal

1034
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:54.560
rule?

1035
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.199
I've been tracking as much honestly because the state rule we

1036
00:48:57.209 --> 00:48:59.290
think is at least as strong as the federal one.

1037
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.340
Probably strong. It has not come out.

1038
00:49:02.669 --> 00:49:03.110
Um

1039
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:03.780
So,

1040
00:49:03.939 --> 00:49:07.780
and then that would probably be effective, you know, required

1041
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:11.580
60 days or something after it come, the rule comes out.

1042
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.979
So that's, that will uh have an impact across the country, but it,

1043
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:18.620
we don't believe it will affect our uh vaccine

1044
00:49:18.629 --> 00:49:20.419
requirement at all because we think ours is,

1045
00:49:20.429 --> 00:49:23.020
uh as I said, at least as strong, if not stronger than the federal one.

1046
00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:26.389
All right. Thanks so much for joining us.

1047
00:49:26.399 --> 00:49:31.260
We will plan, we're not planning to have a briefing next week, but we plan to have one

1048
00:49:31.379 --> 00:49:34.570
on the first of November. And so we'll um hope that

1049
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:39.090
nothing happens between now and then that would require us to um to do

1050
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.199
this because usually it means some tragedy

1051
00:49:41.209 --> 00:49:43.260
is taking place or cases are skyrocketing.

1052
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.750
Um

1053
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:48.350
uh I hope that folks have a safe Halloween and, you know,

1054
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.300
still the mother trick or treating, get out and do the trick or treating,

1055
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:52.909
but wear your mask and be careful.

1056
00:49:52.919 --> 00:49:53.270
Um

1057
00:49:53.739 --> 00:49:56.050
And we'll see you again in a couple of weeks. Thanks a lot.

1058
00:49:56.179 --> 00:49:58.719
Thanks to our panelists so much for joining us. Really appreciate your time

1059
00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:02.879
and let's hope on November 1st that we'll have great news

1060
00:50:02.889 --> 00:50:06.239
about Children 5 to 11 being able to be vaccinated.

1061
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:06.850
Yes.

1062
00:50:08.879 --> 00:50:09.600
Thank you.
