00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.789
I am one of the directors in Wappingers Central School District.

1
00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.929
I love seeing so many cameras on.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.619
So as I'm talking, I see um it's,

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.069
it's like lights flickering and more faces are appearing

4
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:13.619
and um

5
00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.020
so excited to have so many of our

6
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.360
Wappingers Central School District students joining us today.

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.959
So I am gonna be hopping back and forth between our screens,

8
00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:29.209
but I did want to um just share a little bit about what this presentation is.

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.520
We're going to go ahead and we are going to record this session. So, um

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.970
I'm going to go ahead and ask Louise as I'm talking

11
00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:39.209
to get that started,

12
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.240
that will allow any of our students who weren't able to log

13
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.430
in or if you wanna go back at a later date,

14
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:48.529
just to review some of the information our speaker shared.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.459
I will be posting this information on our website.

16
00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:56.110
We also are gonna be um this will be live streamed on our youtube website.

17
00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:59.990
So that's another place that you can go to view this, this information.

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.849
So again, this is called Our Career Zoom Health Series

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.029
So we um are looking forward to doing that.

22
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.139
So I don't have access to go to the next slide.

23
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.589
But if Louise you want to go to the next slide for me,

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.400
I will um just explain this partnership that developed organically.

25
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.690
So we have two systems from the education realm. So obviously myself from Wapping

26
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:35.019

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.819
And in addition,

29
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.930

30
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.099

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.949
And we will be bringing into as you'll see today,

32
00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.860
local and regional employers to bring some insights

33
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.699
to you about the health care field.

34
00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:59.989
So I'll introduce everyone to you if we go to the next slide.

35
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.500
So again, myself,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.509
She is coming to us as the regional director

39
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.960

46
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.059

47
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.110
we were really thrilled to have these ladies with us working on this together

48
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.830
and then our speakers for today,

49
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.970
uh Doctor mclaughlin is gonna be talking to you first

50
00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.570
about an overview of the employment opportunities in our region.

51
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.520
So that's always important to know what is out there um Before

52
00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:54.869
you pursue and put a lot of money into a career.

53
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.889
If there are no jobs coming in that area,

54
00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:02.250
we also have Lane Belmonte coming to us to provide the employer perspective

55
00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.300
and she is the director of Human Resources from Premier Medical Group.

56
00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.240
So, hello, Laney

57
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:09.410
and Karen Ingham

58
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.899
is uh gonna be talking about education planning.

59
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.429
So she has many, many hats that she wears

60
00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.494
at Dutchess Community College.

61
00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.345
She's the department chair and assistant professor.

62
00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:23.815
She um is it leads the Department of Allied

63
00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:27.104
Health and Biological Sciences and also program chair,

64
00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:30.414
clinical laboratory technician and phlebotomy.

65
00:03:30.554 --> 00:03:33.615
So that is a mouthful. So thank you for joining us, Karen.

66
00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:38.029
So just a little bit of how, how we got here through this zoom.

67
00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:41.470
Um What the purpose of this is and I I sort of touched on this,

68
00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.850
but this is an opportunity for you our students

69
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.380
to ask questions, to learn more about the health care profession,

70
00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.660
to see if it is a good fit for you before you do invest money

71
00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.449
um into an expensive college uh decision.

72
00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.649
And from here, I just wanted to go over this the next slide

73
00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.820
and just to give you a background that I um worked with

74
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.839
three of our science teachers in the district to help put together,

75
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.039
we developed a survey.

76
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.660
We had over 310 of our students respond, which is really exciting.

77
00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.399
Um And they gave us some questions that they

78
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.798
would like answered from the health care profession.

79
00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:24.679
And we've designed these series to give you information, but also allow you time

80
00:04:24.929 --> 00:04:29.510
like the last 15 minutes. Um And maybe a little bit longer if you have more questions

81
00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:33.440
for you to ask some questions at the end for our speakers.

82
00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.750
So just a little bit of housekeeping information

83
00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.269
are actually 1 to 2 and

84
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.510
um each month.

85
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.489
So we have these scheduled each month, they're gonna be the third Wednesday,

86
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.429
as I mentioned.

87
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.859
Um And they're gonna begin from 1230 to 115.

88
00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:51.299
We chose Wednesday because those are our virtual

89
00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:54.380
days and your instruction has has let out.

90
00:04:54.579 --> 00:04:58.609
So um we wanted to, to make this accessible as possible.

91
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.239
And as many of you have already started to

92
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.730
do your um the housekeeping pieces on the next screen

93
00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:12.220
are going to be um everyone is on mute as you can tell unless

94
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.559
you're the speaker and that just cuts down on the extra background noise.

95
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.940
So that is why everyone will be on mute.

96
00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:20.549
Um We want your camera to be on,

97
00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.839
this is your chance to make a connection with professionals.

98
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.070
So you do wanna be

99
00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:29.470
um showing us your face and, and letting us know and getting used to that.

100
00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:33.589
This is uh right now, this is how we are connecting with,

101
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.734
with professionals in our area because it's the safest way to, to do that.

102
00:05:37.744 --> 00:05:39.304
Um When we can't be in person,

103
00:05:39.494 --> 00:05:43.605
you will have access to and I will be monitoring the chat once we get going.

104
00:05:43.755 --> 00:05:49.105
Um So you can ask questions and we will um be starting with our first poll

105
00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:53.325
because we wanna know a little bit more about who is on this call today.

106
00:05:53.334 --> 00:05:54.875
How many from, um,

107
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.160
you know what grade you're in? Maybe you're a parent.

108
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.640
So you'll see pop up on your screen.

109
00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:03.279
It's gonna ask you what grade you're in or

110
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.739
if you're a guidance counselor or a teacher,

111
00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:10.350
um, just go ahead and you can see live as the results start to pop in.

112
00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:14.000
So we're pretty excited to see this.

113
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.410
We've got, um, almost,

114
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.269
we have 66% of everybody voted.

115
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.049
Um, and it does seem like, um,

116
00:06:23.579 --> 00:06:25.500
which makes sense that the, the, the,

117
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.619
the highest number is coming from our 11th and 12th graders.

118
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.850
Um, if at any point during this, um,

119
00:06:31.859 --> 00:06:35.010
you do have questions or afterwards you get a question and you're,

120
00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:36.929
you're wondering about, please don't hesitate.

121
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.220
You see my emails come in.

122
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.690
If you haven't seen my emails, they're probably in your junk folder.

123
00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.570
So definitely look for my name and, and try to find them,

124
00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:46.345
but without further ado,

125
00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:50.345
we looks like we have a great group of individuals here today,

126
00:06:50.355 --> 00:06:53.144
um uh that have joined us the majority being

127
00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:57.575
11th and 12th graders, which is absolutely perfect. So we're gonna kick it off.

128
00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.864
I am going to turn it over to Doctor mclaughlin and she's gonna give

129
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:05.625
you an overview of what those employment opportunities look like in our region.

130
00:07:05.984 --> 00:07:07.575
So, thank you, Doctor mclaughlin.

131
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.970
Sorry, I put my face off screen and then I couldn't find the mute button.

132
00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:24.450
Um All right.

133
00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.109
So I'm gonna just give you a little overview of

134
00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:30.019
sort of like what the numbers are in terms of employment

135
00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:33.540
um in general, in our five county regions.

136
00:07:33.549 --> 00:07:34.709
So not just Dutchess County,

137
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.010
but the counties that touch our borders which are Ulster County, Orange, Putnam.

138
00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:43.670
And then um we don't really want to forget Westchester County because it's just

139
00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:47.269
below Putnam South of us and there's a lot of job opportunities there.

140
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.130
Um We're seeing um consistent job growth in health care over the past um five years.

141
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.179
And if you look at the top industries in the region, they,

142
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.970
the number one industry is health care uh along

143
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.149
with social assistance and then government and retail,

144
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.220
um the largest um

145
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.339
healthcare employer shouldn't surprise you is the hospitals,

146
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.019
but there's a lot of other employers throughout the county.

147
00:08:11.489 --> 00:08:13.839
So we're gonna look at two kind of clusters.

148
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.730
We, we kind of look at occupations, we can look at them individually,

149
00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:19.839
but we can also look them in groups and we call them like clusters.

150
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.760
So there's 15 health care support occupations that I pulled some data for

151
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.399
and they're listed on the side.

152
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.670
They started with home health aids, personal care aides and so on.

153
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.750
And when you're looking to see,

154
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.760
you know about um like what job opportunities are there,

155
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.890
you kind of look to the job postings.

156
00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:41.590
So um this job supply right now is at about 48,000

157
00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.289
650.

158
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:49.505
And compensation here is um about 30 1000 a year, almost 32,000.

159
00:08:49.515 --> 00:08:51.994
And a lot of these are your entry level jobs.

160
00:08:52.005 --> 00:08:55.554
Um You know, where you might want to start in, in health care.

161
00:08:55.784 --> 00:08:57.215
And then if you look down,

162
00:08:57.224 --> 00:09:00.885
I also included the um the average wage nationally just so

163
00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:03.065
-- that you would have that as sort
-- of a point to,

164
00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:04.114
to look at.

165
00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:07.135
And then this data came from um Bureau of Labor

166
00:09:07.145 --> 00:09:11.015
Statistics and from um uh this organization called MC.

167
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.929
Then when we look at um

168
00:09:14.169 --> 00:09:18.770
the skills that you need, the, we talk about hard skills and soft skills.

169
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.289
So the hard skills are what you get from like a training

170
00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:25.030
provider from a school and you might end up with a certificate,

171
00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:27.719
um you know, with, with some of these.

172
00:09:27.729 --> 00:09:31.010
So their, their certificates in, you know, like home care.

173
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.030
So when there's job postings,

174
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.409
they all they list

175
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.940
in the posting sort of what they're looking for.

176
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.510
So these are the things that these top

177
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.500
jobs and the frequency that they're looking for.

178
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.789
So they're looking for home care,

179
00:09:41.799 --> 00:09:45.820
caregiving people that can do meal planning and preparation of nutrition, stuff,

180
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.099
personal care,

181
00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:49.659
um nursing, CPR

182
00:09:49.809 --> 00:09:52.700
-- uh medical assistance,
-- um daily

183
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.429
activities, life activities, rehabilitation,

184
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.309
and phlebotomy.

185
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.890
And then we look at um next we go to, we look at soft skills.

186
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.330
-- So
-- before I do

187
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.260
-- this, I want to
-- ask you a

188
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:06.849
question.

189
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.950
So I'm gonna launch a pulp

190
00:10:09.989 --> 00:10:12.469
and this question is for students only.

191
00:10:12.479 --> 00:10:16.390
So please select the answer that that best fits you. So I am currently working.

192
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.369
Don't click that until you read a little bit more.

193
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.409
Um I've had a job in the past. I've had participated in an internship

194
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.099
and then there's some combination.

195
00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:26.659
So I currently have a job and I've done an internship,

196
00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:30.219
I've had a job in the past and I've done an internship, I've not had a job,

197
00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:31.780
but I'm interested in working.

198
00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:33.770
I've not had an internship, internship,

199
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.539
but I'm interested in internship and I've not had a job or

200
00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:39.380
-- internship but am interested in both or
-- none of the above.

201
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.280
If you're not sure

202
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.460
what this is about,

203
00:10:41.729 --> 00:10:44.580
-- that's OK too because we'll explain more as we go
-- through the series,

204
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.750
I'll give it

205
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:50.369
another

206
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.840
20 seconds or so.

207
00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:05.070
OK. Five more seconds.

208
00:11:10.229 --> 00:11:10.609
OK.

209
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.700
OK. So just sharing the results. So people can kind of see

210
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.979
where everybody's at.

211
00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:19.489
OK.

212
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.409
All right. So the reason I asked the question is

213
00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:27.059
if you look at the, the top common skills, OK,

214
00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:29.099
there are skills like communication,

215
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.599
um compassion, customer service is a big one.

216
00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:37.809
Scheduling, clerical work, management, cleanliness, computer literacy,

217
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.890
detail oriented.

218
00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:41.239
These are all skills that you can acquire in an

219
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.390
internship or in really almost any part time job because

220
00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:49.659
these are the, the just the general skills that you need just to be able to work,

221
00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:51.650
go to work, be part of a team.

222
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.299
Um, you know, report well with a supervisor, work well with management and so on.

223
00:11:56.359 --> 00:11:59.250
And then you'll notice too that there's a valid driver's license.

224
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.260
A lot of these, you know, they like you to drive.

225
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.309
So if you, you know,

226
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.239
if you're inclined to drive and you can have an opportunity to learn, um,

227
00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.179
it would be good to get a license if you can.

228
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.229
Um, so where, where are these folks working?

229
00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:14.830
Where are the people in these healthcare support occupations,

230
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.280
working within the industry?

231
00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:18.780
So if you go to um, a hospital

232
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.369
you'll see 12% of the workers there are, are in the healthcare support occupations,

233
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.869
in a nursing care facility.

234
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.869
It's more like 40%. Home health care services is the same around 37%.

235
00:12:31.169 --> 00:12:34.190
And then in offices of physicians it's 18%.

236
00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:38.429
And in dentist it's 33% and someone raised their hands.

237
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.619
Mm.

238
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.030
-- Do you wanna unmute
-- and do you have

239
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:44.340
something.

240
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.260
-- Yeah, go ahead and ask
-- your question. I'm not sure who FBI is, but go ahead.

241
00:12:53.809 --> 00:12:56.969
-- They might wanna think about it or
-- they hit it by accident.

242
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.039
Ok. No problem.

243
00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.159
Ok. All right.

244
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:00.739
So

245
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.169
-- I'm gonna do
-- another quick

246
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.890
call here. I hope.

247
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.280
Sorry, I'm not the best with,

248
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.169
sorry.

249
00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:13.489
Oh

250
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.570
my. What was that

251
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.659
accurate?

252
00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:20.489
-- Sorry
-- about that.

253
00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:26.340
All right.

254
00:13:26.349 --> 00:13:27.830
So we'd like to know if you want

255
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.349
more information on these healthcare support occupations.

256
00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:34.219
So I'm gonna launch the poll and then

257
00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:36.419
we have the list on the side

258
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.950
of uh which occupations these are.

259
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.880
So we're just curious to see if you want more information.

260
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.219
If you're not sure it's OK too.

261
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.520
OK. I'll give you five more seconds

262
00:14:13.859 --> 00:14:15.719
just to share the results. Ok.

263
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.979
So, you know, for the people that are, yes,

264
00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:19.960
we'll definitely be having people come in and

265
00:14:19.969 --> 00:14:22.119
talk about their experience working in these jobs.

266
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.650
How they got trained with the day in the life is

267
00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:28.799
-- um and for people that aren't sure you may just wanna like
-- tune in to see

268
00:14:28.919 --> 00:14:29.650
um

269
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.440
what's,

270
00:14:30.979 --> 00:14:31.880
-- what's what with
-- that?

271
00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:35.419
Um And then the other cluster we're gonna look at

272
00:14:35.429 --> 00:14:39.059
are the 56 health care practitioners and technical occupations.

273
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.090
We're looking at the same five county region

274
00:14:41.219 --> 00:14:46.169
and it goes anywhere from, you know, acupuncturists to, you know, folks working um

275
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.010
um like veteran veterinarians and vet techs.

276
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.640
-- Um I think Amy, did you wanna Doctor Watkins? Did
-- you want to speak to this a

277
00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.080
little.

278
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:55.770
-- Absolutely.
-- So again,

279
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.869
we don't expect that you're going to remember the list.

280
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.820
Um And they can get confusing between the difference of

281
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.869
the health care practitioners and the technical occupations and the support

282
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.090
um health care positions that were in the previous slide.

283
00:15:09.099 --> 00:15:12.130
So you'll, you'll, I'll be posting these, like I said on the web page.

284
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.530
But what's important is in the next slide.

285
00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:18.849
Uh Doctor mclaughlin is going to be talking about the difference in the salaries.

286
00:15:18.859 --> 00:15:19.419
And

287
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.780
I think what you're gonna be hearing from

288
00:15:21.789 --> 00:15:24.630
the different speakers that we have throughout the series

289
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.200
is that there isn't just one path that you can take to get to any of these,

290
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.659
some of these

291
00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:35.440
can be foundational or you can use them um to build up for other positions.

292
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.400
So you don't always have to just say I'm going to school to

293
00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:42.090
be a doctor and do all the schooling and then become a doctor.

294
00:15:42.099 --> 00:15:46.549
You could start in any one of those support professions, get some experience,

295
00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:49.900
get some money and be going to school at the same time.

296
00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:52.580
So it's always good to understand how those two

297
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:57.090
two fields and, and how those salaries are weighing out

298
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.650
and just to point to the internships as well,

299
00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:02.400
and we can continue to talk about this is that through the,

300
00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:05.159
through the school district, we offer work based learning

301
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.039
and internships will um earn you credit.

302
00:16:09.049 --> 00:16:13.409
Um So one, you can take work based learning as an 11th grader and as

303
00:16:13.515 --> 00:16:14.125
12th grader.

304
00:16:14.135 --> 00:16:17.585
So you'll, you would earn two individual credits if you did it both years.

305
00:16:17.924 --> 00:16:21.484
And part of that could be through either a part time job

306
00:16:21.494 --> 00:16:24.075
in any one of these fields to help you get experience,

307
00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:24.945
which is great.

308
00:16:24.955 --> 00:16:29.474
Um, for when you're applying to colleges, you can have practical talking points,

309
00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:30.474
but also you

310
00:16:30.794 --> 00:16:30.835
can

311
00:16:31.984 --> 00:16:32.104
stop

312
00:16:32.445 --> 00:16:32.465
it.

313
00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:34.469
Sorry.

314
00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:37.270
Um But also um you would have to

315
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.039
-- please make sure you're on mute. I'll take
-- care of that. Um

316
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:46.260
So you want to um make sure that you have access to work

317
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.359
based learning just to learn a little bit more about the internships too.

318
00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:50.799
Ok, I'll turn it back over.

319
00:16:51.609 --> 00:16:52.280
Ok, great.

320
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.309
Thank you.

321
00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:55.739
So if we um

322
00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.719
if we look at the the job supply, there's plenty of jobs over 50,000.

323
00:17:00.969 --> 00:17:08.160
Um the compensation, the um the median is 84,900.

324
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.439
So almost 85,000,

325
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.368
you have to remember too. We saw that wide range went from. How

326
00:17:14.479 --> 00:17:16.098
much money do you guys make?

327
00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.079
We'll,

328
00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.280
we'll let doctor mclaughlin continue and then

329
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.430
-- we'll have time for questions
-- afterwards.

330
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.420
Thank you.

331
00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:26.648
Um

332
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.300
When we're, when we're looking at these numbers, we have to realize that um you know,

333
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.109
the meeting is that number in the middle.

334
00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:35.329
If you look down at the bottom, you'll see the averages,

335
00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:38.709
that's kind of everything added together and then averaged out.

336
00:17:38.719 --> 00:17:42.060
So it, there's a, probably a little bit of a bigger range here,

337
00:17:42.069 --> 00:17:46.219
but this gives you sort of an idea of what, what, you know, the salaries that,

338
00:17:46.229 --> 00:17:47.099
that could be made

339
00:17:47.459 --> 00:17:48.449
in these jobs.

340
00:17:48.689 --> 00:17:50.329
And then, you know, you may wanna know where,

341
00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.030
where you might work if you were a healthcare prac

342
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.739
practitioner or you had one of those um tech jobs.

343
00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.729
So 50 in the hospital,

344
00:17:57.739 --> 00:18:02.969
56% of the workers there will be um health care practice

345
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.520
commissioners or like a tech person in a physician's office.

346
00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:11.180
You're looking 43% of them nursing care facilities, skilled nursing facilities,

347
00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:12.709
that's 27%.

348
00:18:12.819 --> 00:18:18.550
Health and personal care stores is 37% and outpatient care centers is 40%

349
00:18:20.329 --> 00:18:22.119
and we'll, we'll look again here.

350
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.829
Now you'll see these hard skills are, you know, just so there's,

351
00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:27.280
there's a lot more involved in it.

352
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:31.030
So there's more college in many of these, especially like nursing.

353
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:35.510
Um you still have your basic life support, but now you get advanced life support.

354
00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:37.430
Um They like they're looking for people that

355
00:18:37.439 --> 00:18:40.469
work in pediatrics with Children intensive care units,

356
00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:45.739
surgery, um emergency departments, acute care and medical surgical, nursing.

357
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.750
-- So those are all um skills that they're looking
-- for.

358
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.619
And then, but what's so interesting is if you look at those, the soft skills,

359
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.869
the common skills, they haven't changed too much.

360
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.430
You know, you're still looking at communication, you're looking at management,

361
00:18:59.439 --> 00:19:03.369
compassion, customer service, leadership these are all things that you learn at,

362
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.359
at any job or any internship that you're doing.

363
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.170
You may see that like management has moved up from

364
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.979
um the previous slides where it was much lower.

365
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.689
But now it, it's still important. These are all skills that we need to do.

366
00:19:15.699 --> 00:19:16.689
Like planning

367
00:19:16.939 --> 00:19:19.540
um uh teaching problem solving.

368
00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.520
-- This is all stuff
-- that you, you can do in school with being

369
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.599
organized and

370
00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:26.209
getting things in on time and, and all of that

371
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.339
and

372
00:19:28.739 --> 00:19:30.750
-- what I wanna
-- do a quick poll here

373
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.280
to see who's interested.

374
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.699
Let's see.

375
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.640
So

376
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.109
if you would like more information on um

377
00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:43.619
this 56 clusters you're gonna put. Um

378
00:19:43.819 --> 00:19:44.510
Yes,

379
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.180
if you don't, it's no. And if you're not sure,

380
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.300
then you could, you not sure.

381
00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.890
Give me 10 seconds.

382
00:20:04.819 --> 00:20:05.520
Seems like

383
00:20:05.989 --> 00:20:06.010
it

384
00:20:06.369 --> 00:20:07.180
of interest.

385
00:20:07.689 --> 00:20:08.290
Yes.

386
00:20:08.569 --> 00:20:09.760
-- So
-- that's great to see.

387
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.439
-- Share the
-- results. So yes,

388
00:20:13.449 --> 00:20:15.040
there is a lot of interest there.

389
00:20:15.619 --> 00:20:16.130
That's terrific.

390
00:20:16.849 --> 00:20:17.439
Great.

391
00:20:17.969 --> 00:20:18.260
Ok.

392
00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:21.790
-- Ok.
-- So next, I would like to introduce you.

393
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.699
Our, our speaker from Premier Medical Group. This is Laney

394
00:20:25.979 --> 00:20:29.800
Belmonte. She is going to provide you with the employer perspective.

395
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.839
Um As I said, she's the director of Human Resources.

396
00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:36.599
So thinking through what would a potential employer be looking for.

397
00:20:36.859 --> 00:20:38.040
So go ahead, Laney.

398
00:20:43.969 --> 00:20:45.829
Oh, she might be on mute.

399
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.829
Think you might be on mute. Laney,

400
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.130
I

401
00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:54.400
can

402
00:20:54.589 --> 00:20:54.630
meet

403
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.979
you.

404
00:20:55.229 --> 00:20:55.489
There

405
00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:55.709
you go.

406
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.869
How's that?

407
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.609
Ok.

408
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.060
So hello everyone. I'm glad to see so many of you interested in health care.

409
00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:05.050
Um

410
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:08.099
I work in human resources at Premier Medical Group.

411
00:21:08.109 --> 00:21:12.030
And uh one of the things we do in human resources is we hire people.

412
00:21:12.609 --> 00:21:13.349
Um

413
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.430
So in that premiere,

414
00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:17.229
we have many different uh types of health care

415
00:21:17.239 --> 00:21:20.979
positions from those support positions that we were talking about

416
00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:24.160
um through to many of the technical positions.

417
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.319
And one of the questions we might ask someone, you know,

418
00:21:27.329 --> 00:21:31.199
in an interview when they're interviewing for a job is what

419
00:21:31.209 --> 00:21:35.229
led you to the career of being in health care.

420
00:21:35.459 --> 00:21:36.239
So

421
00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:42.069
I wanna talk to you about reasons you might think you want to be in health care.

422
00:21:43.189 --> 00:21:46.479
So one reason is you like working with people

423
00:21:46.969 --> 00:21:51.319
um or you're very compassionate and you, you like caring for people.

424
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.560
Uh or you like science, you've enjoyed your science classes,

425
00:21:55.569 --> 00:21:59.969
you like uh the research involved, you're very analytical.

426
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.400
Um you like to solve problems.

427
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.680
Uh That might be another reason why

428
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:06.910
job stability,

429
00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:09.949
there is a lot of job stability in health care.

430
00:22:10.209 --> 00:22:15.069
Um People are gonna continue to have Children and babies.

431
00:22:15.079 --> 00:22:19.569
Um Unfortunately, illnesses um are inevitable.

432
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.069
Uh So there's, there's always gonna be a need for that personal care.

433
00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:26.430
Uh and health care workers,

434
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.069
our population is growing.

435
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.819
So um with, with the growing population,

436
00:22:33.229 --> 00:22:37.170
uh the demand for health care workers is increasing.

437
00:22:39.869 --> 00:22:43.800
So many health care positions are well paid

438
00:22:43.979 --> 00:22:44.670
um

439
00:22:44.819 --> 00:22:48.359
as the demand increases for healthcare workers typically.

440
00:22:48.369 --> 00:22:50.869
So do the, the, the salaries,

441
00:22:52.109 --> 00:22:58.849
health care careers are really diverse. You can, uh go into just general medicine.

442
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.859
Uh, you can choose to go into a specialty.

443
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.810
Uh, you know, here at premiere, we have many specialties, uh,

444
00:23:06.119 --> 00:23:09.290
you know, on the slide here it says foot, mouth, heart lungs.

445
00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.199
So a podiatrist is someone who specializes with feet.

446
00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:15.010
A cardiologist would specialize

447
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.880
with, um, with issues of the heart.

448
00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:21.560
Uh Then there's also the administrative and management side.

449
00:23:21.569 --> 00:23:25.140
So we have medical billing people that are, they,

450
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:29.140
they're not clinical people who are doing hands on uh patient care,

451
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.500
but they're still in health care and they

452
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.920
do uh billing or marketing or human resources.

453
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.959
So there's, there's other admin

454
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.189
of options in health care as well.

455
00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:43.469
So the the good news is there's lots of choices,

456
00:23:43.479 --> 00:23:46.390
there are many choices in the field of health care.

457
00:23:46.589 --> 00:23:53.030
Uh Some that require 1 to 2 years of advanced study after high school.

458
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:59.199
Uh Some that might require uh four years of study or, or more and typically your,

459
00:23:59.209 --> 00:24:00.859
your income will increase

460
00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:02.829
the more education

461
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:03.589
you have.

462
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:13.130
So what can you guys do now to prepare for a career in health care?

463
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.719
One is to finish high school, get your diploma.

464
00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:19.579
So that's, that's the first thing that you need to do.

465
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.359
Um start doing some research,

466
00:24:22.849 --> 00:24:27.560
Google stuff. Look online, talk to your guidance counselors, talk to your parents,

467
00:24:27.849 --> 00:24:28.560
um

468
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.079
perhaps talk to a healthcare professional who's doing the job,

469
00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:36.089
find out what their day to day is like, what they like, what they dislike.

470
00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:40.439
Um Those are all things that you can do to sort of explore this,

471
00:24:40.449 --> 00:24:42.760
this um this field of study

472
00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:45.630
and try to gain some experience.

473
00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:48.550
There might be some internships out there.

474
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:54.109
Uh Oftentimes you can shadow a health care professional. Um We've done that here.

475
00:24:54.119 --> 00:24:59.410
I've had a couple of people come through here and uh just come in for a day

476
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:05.219
and shadow someone to see what it's like to work uh in a particular uh position.

477
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.550
Um

478
00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:13.180
We also have hired people just for summer jobs, you know, so you get a flavor of,

479
00:25:13.209 --> 00:25:16.699
you know, what it's like to even be in the healthcare environment.

480
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:19.709
Uh There's some volunteer opportunities.

481
00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:22.920
Uh Sometimes the nursing homes in the hospitals have volunteer hos

482
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.530
uh opportunities.

483
00:25:24.969 --> 00:25:26.219
So, um

484
00:25:26.579 --> 00:25:30.619
so the good news is, it's, it's very diverse.

485
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:34.319
Um Healthcare can be a really rewarding career.

486
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.709
Um I have a couple of resources here that uh I just want you to take a quick look at

487
00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:42.420
because this, this could be part of your research.

488
00:25:42.819 --> 00:25:43.489
Um

489
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.459
Louise, if you can, you click on that first link

490
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.430
-- and Laney while we're
-- waiting for Louise to bring up that page.

491
00:25:57.439 --> 00:26:01.489
A question came in from Rebecca asking if there's um

492
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.810
-- um uh a minimum
-- age that you need to be in order to do

493
00:26:04.819 --> 00:26:05.560
shadowing.

494
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.709
So,

495
00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:16.380
uh we typically have uh I would say you know, 17, probably 17

496
00:26:16.719 --> 00:26:17.579
and above.

497
00:26:18.859 --> 00:26:20.000
Great, great.

498
00:26:21.209 --> 00:26:25.709
Uh So this is uh US news and it's best health care jobs.

499
00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:29.949
These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before.

500
00:26:29.959 --> 00:26:33.949
Uh th those that typically require more education.

501
00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:38.209
So you can see we'll just for, you know, demonstration purposes.

502
00:26:38.219 --> 00:26:43.670
Um You can see, uh I'm sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen.

503
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.729
Is there a way to

504
00:26:46.579 --> 00:26:48.400
maybe I can just click it off. Thank you.

505
00:26:48.619 --> 00:26:49.300
I have it.

506
00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:51.000
-- I
-- got it.

507
00:26:57.849 --> 00:27:04.099
So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes it's a little

508
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.869
switch back and forth

509
00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:09.819
but we're waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit?

510
00:27:09.829 --> 00:27:12.810
Um Some of our students aren't familiar with that term.

511
00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:14.089
Sure.

512
00:27:14.319 --> 00:27:17.810
So shadowing is where you, you might come in.

513
00:27:17.819 --> 00:27:22.400
Um, maybe you're gonna shadow another medical assistant for the day.

514
00:27:22.569 --> 00:27:25.369
Uh You might sit and talk with her and find out

515
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.770
what she's doing whether she's doing something in the computer.

516
00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.560
Um, you know, in health care there's um,

517
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.640
there's privacy issues with patients so there might be limited.

518
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:43.089
Um, you know, it may be limited in terms of what you are able to know about a patient,

519
00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:48.439
but you can get a sense of, you know, follow them around, see what they're doing,

520
00:27:48.449 --> 00:27:50.459
watch them take a blood pressure,

521
00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:55.760
um, you know, watch them, uh do vital signs, things of that nature.

522
00:27:57.589 --> 00:27:59.359
So the, uh,

523
00:28:00.189 --> 00:28:02.209
the resource that's there. There we go.

524
00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:05.890
So this is the one that has more technical jobs.

525
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.060
Um, if we look down a little bit, you see the number one, these are, uh,

526
00:28:10.069 --> 00:28:14.319
the technical jobs that are ranked, you know, dentist is ranked number one, a

527
00:28:14.439 --> 00:28:16.530
physician assistant, number two.

528
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.290
but what I wanna point out is one, it'll describe a little bit about what that job is.

529
00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:24.800
If you click on the read more

530
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.859
and then,

531
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.020
uh, Louise, if you could just go down just a little bit

532
00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:35.489
and the o just

533
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.739
up a little bit,

534
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.640
there we go right there. Um,

535
00:28:42.449 --> 00:28:44.550
oh, I think it was on the first,

536
00:28:44.939 --> 00:28:46.229
the first page.

537
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.660
Maybe go just that one.

538
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.000
Ok.

539
00:28:53.239 --> 00:28:55.900
So you can see there on the right hand side,

540
00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:59.219
it will say the number of projected jobs in that field.

541
00:28:59.229 --> 00:29:04.819
So for example, physician assistant, it says there's 37,000 projected jobs.

542
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:09.119
The median salary is 100 and 8000 and change.

543
00:29:09.305 --> 00:29:12.045
The education required is a master's degree.

544
00:29:12.285 --> 00:29:18.064
So this is a quick resource that you can use to look at different kinds of jobs.

545
00:29:18.074 --> 00:29:20.925
Get a sense of how much schooling you'd have to do,

546
00:29:21.094 --> 00:29:24.765
how many jobs are out there in that field. And what's the salary.

547
00:29:24.925 --> 00:29:26.114
So, um,

548
00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:27.510
um,

549
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.569
the second link and,

550
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.250
and you,

551
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:36.589
you can either pull that up or if it's being difficult, Louise, I can just speak to it.

552
00:29:36.989 --> 00:29:39.869
Um, the other link that's on the first page.

553
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:45.030
Can, can you see it? Did it change for you guys? If not, I'll stop sharing with you.

554
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:46.689
You

555
00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:48.829
-- have to stop in the beach here,
-- let me

556
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.569
of the three share.

557
00:29:54.829 --> 00:30:01.199
So uh this is another link from US news. Now this is more those the support positions

558
00:30:01.439 --> 00:30:03.170
uh that we were talking about.

559
00:30:03.329 --> 00:30:08.810
So these typically require less schooling. Um not all but some

560
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:09.849
uh

561
00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:15.229
physical therapy assistant you see here, number three and again, on the right,

562
00:30:15.239 --> 00:30:17.599
you can see the projected number of jobs,

563
00:30:17.609 --> 00:30:23.050
the median salary and uh that this particular job requires an associate's degree.

564
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.449
So again,

565
00:30:24.459 --> 00:30:28.650
this is another um just another resource for you to use where

566
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.189
you can quickly get a description of what the job is.

567
00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:37.250
See if there are lots of jobs or very little jobs available,

568
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.089
what the median salaries are and what uh

569
00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:43.250
what education requirements there are for the position.

570
00:30:48.119 --> 00:30:48.859
Great. And uh

571
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:49.290
la

572
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.000
would you mind?

573
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.790
-- There's just two,
-- two questions that

574
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.489
came in um And your, your advice would be great.

575
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.910
-- Um A
-- student was asking the best

576
00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.359
-- way to
-- um find out about an opportunity to shadow.

577
00:31:02.369 --> 00:31:05.449
Should they reach out directly to different health care?

578
00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:07.349
Should they go through their guidance counselor?

579
00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:09.630
-- What would be the best way for them
-- to do that?

580
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:18.079
-- Well, if the,
-- if the school has any connections uh with different um health care

581
00:31:18.189 --> 00:31:24.020
uh facilities, that might be the best way then they can advocate for those students.

582
00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.300
Um If in the absence of those,

583
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:32.369
the student can uh try to contact someone at the organization.

584
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.050
Um but it is probably better to have um

585
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:37.140
-- an
-- advocate,

586
00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:38.150
right?

587
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.589
And I think like, um I can speak from the the school perspective,

588
00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:44.189
work based learning would be the a great way to do that.

589
00:31:44.199 --> 00:31:45.750
So for our district right now,

590
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.390
Mrs Noy is in charge of the work based learning program.

591
00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:52.199
So if that's something um you can work

592
00:31:52.209 --> 00:31:53.910
with your guidance counselor to make sure you have

593
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.589
work based learning on uh your schedule and then get in contact with Mrs Noy and,

594
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.040
and she can uh work with you on different

595
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.989
ways uh to reach out to the different agencies.

596
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.699
And I know another student had asked about an internship with a

597
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.780
um with a dietitian or nutritionist.

598
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.109
And I would say that that would work the same way from our perspective,

599
00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:15.209
working at the schools.

600
00:32:15.219 --> 00:32:17.459
Although they probably could reach out to

601
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.060
um a specific person that is in that field.

602
00:32:23.709 --> 00:32:23.849
Is that

603
00:32:23.989 --> 00:32:24.020
good

604
00:32:24.189 --> 00:32:25.349
for a second question

605
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.949
that I it was kind of both of them. They were very

606
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:28.900
Oh

607
00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:29.160
yeah.

608
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.849
So is that, is that it for you, Miss Brown?

609
00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.680
-- That is it
-- for me? Unless anyone has any questions, I'm happy to

610
00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:38.560
um answer them.

611
00:32:39.089 --> 00:32:39.459
Ok.

612
00:32:39.469 --> 00:32:42.979
And what we might do is we'll let um M Ingham go ahead and

613
00:32:42.989 --> 00:32:46.579
then we can have questions across the board for everyone because I wanna make

614
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.949
that we do have time for, um, Miss Karen

615
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.630
Ingham to speak from Dutchess Community College.

616
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.160
So I'm gonna turn it over to her and just keep putting your questions in the chat.

617
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:02.430
I'll try to get to them, um, and, and bring them on to the end if we, if we have time.

618
00:33:03.069 --> 00:33:04.000
Go ahead, Karen.

619
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:08.449
-- All right. Well,
-- thank you everybody. It's a pleasure to be here this afternoon.

620
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.239
Um I'm here to talk a little bit about um what you might wanna think about

621
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:18.609
doing when you're still in high school to prepare you for entry at the college level

622
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.699
and uh not just community college. I mean, we're an excellent choice.

623
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.260
Um We have a low tuition and we do offer a

624
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.979
variety of allied health programs you can see on the screen,

625
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.869
the college offers offers programs that might

626
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.369
take perhaps two semesters to complete.

627
00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.349
So those that are certificate programs are either a semester

628
00:33:40.359 --> 00:33:43.030
or two in length if you're a full time student.

629
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.650
Um and then we have programs that are designed

630
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.729
for you to go directly into the workforce.

631
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.510
So if you're interested in perhaps um

632
00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:56.380
becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT,

633
00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.199
um if you're interested in, if you like working in the in health care,

634
00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:02.489
but not sure you wanna have direct patient care,

635
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.930
you might think about something like clinical lab technician.

636
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.320
Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license,

637
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.879
once you complete your programs here at Dutchess,

638
00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:17.208
you're eligible to take the state licensing exams.

639
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:21.040
And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh,

640
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.340
the employment opportunities will basically, you know,

641
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.350
hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse.

642
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.830
If you're interested in transferring to a four year school, you're interested.

643
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.418
I, I looked at the list people,

644
00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:39.199
a lot of people wanted to be doctors and physical therapists and nurses and,

645
00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:44.379
um, all those high level jobs. I mean, Dutchess is a great place to start.

646
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.550
Even if you're thinking,

647
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.080
um, you know, you know, for sure you wanna continue on.

648
00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:53.010
It really doesn't matter where you start, but it matters where you finish.

649
00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.120
So we are an excellent choice, especially during,

650
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:58.830
um, online teaching.

651
00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:01.729
You know, when maybe you want to be the next Doctor Fauci,

652
00:35:01.739 --> 00:35:03.449
we have a public health program,

653
00:35:03.919 --> 00:35:07.580
um, that is articulated with Suny Albany, which means

654
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:11.760
you can take the two years, uh, of courses, full time at Dutchess

655
00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:16.209
and all of your credits will transfer to University of Albany.

656
00:35:16.219 --> 00:35:19.580
So you can complete and get your bachelor's degree in public health

657
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:23.760
or you may choose to stay and get your masters in public health.

658
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.840
Um, so there are a lot of opportunities we also have, um,

659
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.540
what we call the Liberal Arts science pathway.

660
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:35.649
So if you do wanna be that physical therapist, you wanna be that, um, dentist,

661
00:35:35.659 --> 00:35:37.050
you wanna be the doctor.

662
00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.360
You wanna be the occupational therapist.

663
00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.929
You can again, start at dutchess.

664
00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:46.070
Get two years of education, take all your sciences,

665
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.669
your general education that you would normally take at a

666
00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:51.729
four year school as a freshman or a sophomore.

667
00:35:51.962 --> 00:35:55.282
And then those credits transfer, um, to your institutions.

668
00:35:55.292 --> 00:35:57.732
We have students who transfer all over the place.

669
00:35:57.992 --> 00:36:00.873
Um, they may, a lot of them go to Suny Binghamton.

670
00:36:01.133 --> 00:36:03.393
It has an excellent science reputation.

671
00:36:03.403 --> 00:36:08.103
Suny Stony Brook, Suny, New Paul University of Albany.

672
00:36:08.202 --> 00:36:11.603
And of course, Marist, uh Mount Saint Mary's.

673
00:36:11.683 --> 00:36:15.266
Um, we have hi and the students who go through dutchess

674
00:36:15.575 --> 00:36:19.176
and transfer, they have a very high success rate.

675
00:36:19.275 --> 00:36:22.335
Once they transfer, our studies have shown

676
00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:26.075
that um our graduates typically uh do better

677
00:36:26.085 --> 00:36:29.135
at a four year institution than other transfer students

678
00:36:29.275 --> 00:36:33.615
as well as some of their original students that started there as a freshman.

679
00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:38.199
So right in your, in your neighborhood, you know, you've got Duchess and,

680
00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:43.250
and some of our tech jobs, you know, a semester, two years, four years, I mean,

681
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.899
you can just keep building on as was already mentioned.

682
00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:47.600
And then before you know, it,

683
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.209
um you can be out there doing what you hope to do

684
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.020
while you're in high school.

685
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.620
I'm gonna tell you probably the same thing your mother has told you.

686
00:36:55.629 --> 00:36:56.699
Your father has told you,

687
00:36:56.709 --> 00:36:59.419
your guidance counselors have told you and your teachers have told you

688
00:36:59.639 --> 00:37:01.709
if you are interested in health care,

689
00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:06.020
you need to work hard at the sciences, your biology classes,

690
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.179
if you're lucky enough and you, maybe you're doing a P biology,

691
00:37:09.419 --> 00:37:12.239
maybe with Miss Glancy or Missus mcfarland.

692
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:16.989
I mean, you're gonna walk out and you're gonna do very well when you get to your, your,

693
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.219
your institution of choice.

694
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:20.199
Um,

695
00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:24.419
but, um, you know, continue with your chemistry,

696
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:26.379
continue with your math.

697
00:37:26.889 --> 00:37:27.419
Um,

698
00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:30.340
you really want to make sure you have sharp skills

699
00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:33.580
because that's not gonna go away as you enter into,

700
00:37:33.709 --> 00:37:36.300
um, the courses at the college level.

701
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:38.419
You also want to try to

702
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.520
be mindful about your senior year. I know it's senioritis kicks in but you want to

703
00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:49.129
m make sure that you are challenging yourself, pick courses.

704
00:37:49.139 --> 00:37:51.929
I mean, obviously any courses that you need to get your diploma,

705
00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:55.290
but if you have the opportunity to take those challenging courses,

706
00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.010
those A P courses, if that's a recommendation,

707
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.159
we would highly recommend that you do that.

708
00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.040
You wanna show your, um, your college as you go through the admission process

709
00:38:05.439 --> 00:38:09.330
that, um, you're not afraid of hard course work.

710
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.290
Um,

711
00:38:10.739 --> 00:38:14.020
they don't necessarily like to see a whole bunch of electives.

712
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.360
Electives are great, right? Because how do you know what you wanna do?

713
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.439
I know there's seventh graders, eighth graders, ninth graders,

714
00:38:20.449 --> 00:38:21.699
everyone's here today.

715
00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:25.449
Very few people know for sure what they wanna do.

716
00:38:25.459 --> 00:38:27.449
Or even if they think they know what they wanna do,

717
00:38:27.459 --> 00:38:29.540
they might still end up changing their mind.

718
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.199
And so by taking an elective, maybe a computer class or,

719
00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:37.260
or maybe a forensic science class, something outside of your normal, uh,

720
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.719
course options.

721
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:39.520
Who knows?

722
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:44.810
That experience might, might help you really fine tune what you wanna study at your,

723
00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.179
at your institution.

724
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.040
Um, and then if you're worried about your ranking, if you're taking an A P class,

725
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.939
if you get a B plus

726
00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:57.409
in a college level biology class,

727
00:38:57.739 --> 00:38:59.270
OK. Put that in your essay.

728
00:38:59.419 --> 00:39:02.330
You know, I, I chose to challenge myself.

729
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.000
Um I took college level calculus.

730
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.810
I chose to challenge myself in my senior year or my junior year

731
00:39:08.949 --> 00:39:12.020
because I think it's important to, you know, if I'm capable, I should,

732
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.189
I should try to do it

733
00:39:13.439 --> 00:39:15.030
and uh you know,

734
00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:17.610
get position yourself, you know, for that,

735
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.489
for that uh transfer to the four year school.

736
00:39:21.979 --> 00:39:22.679
Um

737
00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.159
Anything else? Amy?

738
00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:28.250
I don't wanna, I, I'm just looking at the time I wanna give opportunity for,

739
00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.080
for everyone to ask questions.

740
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.629
-- Absolutely. We did have a few questions
-- come in.

741
00:39:32.639 --> 00:39:33.979
-- Um
-- Someone was asking

742
00:39:33.989 --> 00:39:36.100
about taking classes the best way

743
00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.870
-- to take these classes
-- while they're in high school.

744
00:39:37.879 --> 00:39:38.709
And I do think

745
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.909
-- you
-- definitely wanna check with your counselor.

746
00:39:40.919 --> 00:39:44.030
-- You
-- can look online and um see our course handbook.

747
00:39:44.639 --> 00:39:47.179
I do understand what Miss Ingham was saying about electives.

748
00:39:47.189 --> 00:39:49.679
You wanna push yourself with your core content classes,

749
00:39:49.969 --> 00:39:53.189
but it is really great. Um particularly for the health sciences.

750
00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:55.679
-- Our anatomy
-- and physiology class is a great way

751
00:39:55.689 --> 00:39:57.739
to figure out if that's something that you,

752
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:58.780
that you enjoy.

753
00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.379
Um I know over at

754
00:40:00.489 --> 00:40:04.729
Ketchum, Miss Gorman is teaching that class and, and she's on the call today.

755
00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:09.370
Um So you wanna, you wanna see these courses talking to your teachers too,

756
00:40:09.379 --> 00:40:11.270
specifically, your science teachers.

757
00:40:11.469 --> 00:40:15.590
Um They can make recommendations about specific um courses that they have

758
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.149
-- on here And I see Miss mcfarland
-- is on here too.

759
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:22.770
-- Um
-- So I'm trying to just wanna see if I have um

760
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.739
any

761
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.020
hospital.

762
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:35.159
-- Um So
-- I think what we can do if um you wanna raise your, your hand, we can um come off Mike

763
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.379
and um but I wanna make sure we don't have everybody coming off Mike um at once.

764
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:43.540
Um so we can try that and if it gets a little bit, I see them,

765
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.800
we will um go to the chat box but

766
00:40:45.919 --> 00:40:47.780
I know sometimes it's easier just to,

767
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.419
to raise your hand and I'll look for your hand coming up

768
00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:53.129
on the screen and try to call on you for questions.

769
00:40:53.429 --> 00:40:54.489
Um So ami

770
00:40:54.629 --> 00:40:56.669
you have a question if you wanna come off.

771
00:40:56.679 --> 00:40:59.739
-- Um I can actually unmute you if you wanna ask
-- your question.

772
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:03.459
-- Um Are
-- there any like books that you read

773
00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:06.419
that really like impact you and influence you to

774
00:41:06.659 --> 00:41:08.260
-- go into the medical
-- field?

775
00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:09.739
Great question.

776
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.409
Uh I'm gonna turn it over to one of our,

777
00:41:16.419 --> 00:41:18.919
-- our professionals because I'm not in the medical
-- field,

778
00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:21.570
I'll answer that one.

779
00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:27.370
So, um I, um I always, I still love them. I like mystery novels.

780
00:41:27.379 --> 00:41:31.649
I like, you know, kind of like crime and mystery and then,

781
00:41:32.439 --> 00:41:33.129
um

782
00:41:33.989 --> 00:41:37.300
you know, all, all those series, you know, like, uh, I don't know,

783
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:39.850
but I just like to solve mysteries.

784
00:41:39.879 --> 00:41:40.090
Um,

785
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.580
kind of like it's a puzzle and I tie that in

786
00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:47.330
with studying science where we always don't know the answer,

787
00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.969
but we do the research to try to get to that point.

788
00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.479
So I would think if you're interested in mystery novels,

789
00:41:53.489 --> 00:41:58.149
you might wanna think about, you know, um working in a lab,

790
00:41:58.389 --> 00:42:00.739
um working in health care because

791
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:02.139
that's all about healthcare,

792
00:42:02.149 --> 00:42:06.080
trying to figure out what's going on with the physiology of our patients.

793
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:08.129
Great

794
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:13.020
other questions. Um I'll look to see if you raise your hand and

795
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.340
-- get you to on
-- mute.

796
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.520
-- Don't be shy.
-- Ok, Gavin, you have your hand up.

797
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.580
You can, uh come off mute, but

798
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.639
most volunteer programs were canceled because of the Coronavirus.

799
00:42:29.649 --> 00:42:31.639
Do you know what hospitals are doing?

800
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.760
-- Like if they're doing anything
-- virtual?

801
00:42:34.129 --> 00:42:35.120
That's a great question.

802
00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.510
I don't know if, can you hear me?

803
00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:40.540
Yes.

804
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.989
I don't know if the hospitals are doing anything virtual for volunteers.

805
00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:47.110
Um

806
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:52.330
I'm not sure what a volunteer would do. Uh, virtually.

807
00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:53.929
Um,

808
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:59.800
you know, I know many of even the uh clinicals that the,

809
00:43:00.389 --> 00:43:00.699
uh, you know,

810
00:43:00.709 --> 00:43:05.209
nursing students and nurse practitioner students are virtual right now.

811
00:43:05.219 --> 00:43:10.739
They're not even doing in person for those. Um those, some of those are virtual, but

812
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.370
I'm not sure about uh for volunteers.

813
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.199
I don't know of anything.

814
00:43:17.979 --> 00:43:18.360
OK.

815
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:23.639
And I think, um to, to your point, Gavin and others are probably thinking of it.

816
00:43:23.649 --> 00:43:27.879
It's just really just checking in with um your counselors

817
00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:30.199
to hear if they've heard anything they can reach out.

818
00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:31.350
You can you, you know,

819
00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.889
I always tell people if you have a question, you're more than welcome to email me.

820
00:43:34.899 --> 00:43:39.280
I may not know the answer, but I will work hard to try to find it out, uh find it for you.

821
00:43:39.459 --> 00:43:45.189
Um But ii, I do think that um particularly because of, of the pandemic,

822
00:43:45.199 --> 00:43:48.810
the health care sciences are really limiting right now having

823
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.250
um people come in but perhaps that they're working um

824
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:55.469
-- to develop some, some remote
-- opportunities.

825
00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:59.969
I, I just wanna, I'm sorry, I just wanna say one thing. Um So

826
00:44:00.649 --> 00:44:01.709
what we've done,

827
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:06.229
we do have a couple of college students that are doing temperature taking

828
00:44:06.489 --> 00:44:10.840
because because of the pandemic, we've had to station people

829
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.149
in front of uh all of our different offices.

830
00:44:14.159 --> 00:44:19.469
So um that is one thing to potentially uh you know, look, look into,

831
00:44:19.479 --> 00:44:22.629
they might have temperature takers that sit in the front.

832
00:44:23.219 --> 00:44:25.040
Right. Great. Good point.

833
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:29.000
-- Yeah, I think that some of these uh newer
-- needs are developing as this

834
00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:29.179
is

835
00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:30.449
new. So,

836
00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:35.600
-- um, it
-- certainly, uh, is something to keep checking in on. Um, and, and obviously

837
00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.350
there's certain things that you can do at certain ages. So, um,

838
00:44:39.479 --> 00:44:43.050
you, as you get, um, closer to graduation or post graduation,

839
00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.000
more opportunities will open up for you.

840
00:44:45.469 --> 00:44:46.439
-- Um, I do
-- know,

841
00:44:46.449 --> 00:44:50.280
-- I want to be sensitive
-- to time and I do know we have one more poll question.

842
00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:51.479
Um, I believe.

843
00:44:51.899 --> 00:44:56.050
Um, so I don't know if Doctor mclaughlin, if you wanna launch that, it,

844
00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:56.929
it speaking to,

845
00:44:56.939 --> 00:44:58.469
I know a few people have asked um

846
00:44:58.479 --> 00:45:01.159
what other professions we're gonna be talking about?

847
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.719
And um we are interested in that and we can go back

848
00:45:04.729 --> 00:45:08.520
through the chat to see if we have um captured those.

849
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.060
-- Do we have one more pool?
-- Yes. OK, good.

850
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:17.149
-- So, um these, these um are one of the, like
-- I think it was the top 10

851
00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.429
professions that came from the survey that we um collected data from you.

852
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.189
-- And we're just
-- trying to get a sense on

853
00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:30.520
-- um working with the
-- professionals that we have access to um who we might

854
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:35.520
be able to arrange for the future um Wednesday series that are coming up.

855
00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.280
-- So,
-- um I think the Zoom,

856
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:42.189
-- the
-- Zoom platform is gonna provide us a great number of opportunities,

857
00:45:42.199 --> 00:45:43.429
but it's always good to know

858
00:45:43.804 --> 00:45:46.385
um where your interest lies.

859
00:45:46.534 --> 00:45:49.735
-- Um And you may, you may be choosing
-- one of

860
00:45:49.745 --> 00:45:50.485
these fields.

861
00:45:50.495 --> 00:45:52.945
And then after hearing someone else speak about

862
00:45:52.955 --> 00:45:55.024
their field that you had not considered.

863
00:45:55.104 --> 00:45:59.064
That might be very interesting to you too. So, that's the, the great part.

864
00:45:59.074 --> 00:46:01.945
There's no, there's no bad one to join. So

865
00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:04.310
we'll just give it a few more seconds.

866
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.330
-- And if some people are just reading
-- through them,

867
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.360
-- we have about 60
-- 5% of you have voted

868
00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:17.709
a few more

869
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.949
and then we can, um,

870
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.129
end the pole

871
00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.320
at about 70% now.

872
00:46:26.669 --> 00:46:31.959
So obviously, doctors, um, doctor is still at the top of our list. Um

873
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.050
But it's great to see some of these other professions and I feel um

874
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.979
that now that you'll go back to this slide and see the

875
00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:41.939
different categories of the healthcare professions

876
00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:44.649
um for the support versus practitioners.

877
00:46:44.659 --> 00:46:48.020
Um That'll be really helpful for you too to be thinking about.

878
00:46:48.199 --> 00:46:53.370
So I am thrilled again, you can see the results coming up on the pole.

879
00:46:53.379 --> 00:46:55.080
Um I think you can see them

880
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:56.489
and um

881
00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:02.320
I just wanna thank again our speakers. So thank you again to
