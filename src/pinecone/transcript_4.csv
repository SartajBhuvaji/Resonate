spk_1,34.96965,35.05883333,"So whats the difference between that slide and the  next one that doesnt have anything under
 security?"
spk_0,35.06033333,36.67983333,"This, this was the um honestly, so that, so when I first got this, it didnt have this and it didnt have anything under security. So this, this was what I do is just your iteration of it. Yeah, this is, this is mine. This is I just put here so that I would have like the original statements like, you know, automate nearly anything, collaborate on everything. I kind of like that. But I, you know, this one I hate scale up, speed up, test up. I dont think anybody tests up. I think thats really goofy. So you hate it. Uh This one I love that for me. Its I love it or I hate it, right?  Um I
 love, I love how youre just like uh so anyway, the what I love is just in five minutes now and then we can just kind of end the call is kind of like um anything that you would change this out for, anything that you would change this out for. And then actually, lets start here. This one I couldnt pick and Ill, Ill tell you why. Its because I, I like things to have parody in, in their tone, right? So this is maybe like super nuanced elements of messaging but I hate it if its like a single source of truth, thats like a noun phrase. End to end control. Thats like a noun items. So you could say with Git Lab, you get a single source of truth. With Git lab, you get end to end control. And you cant say with Git Lab, you get, move fast with confidence.  No,
 but you can say more speed, less risk. I like that one the best."
spk_1,36.68,36.69915,I dont like the last one.
spk_0,36.7125,36.87448333,"I agree. Thats, thats why I put this one at top was for that parody. And then so it sounds like kind of yalls thoughts or thats, thats good as well."
spk_4,36.89333333,37.18131667,"Uh Yeah, the only thing it might be missing but I dont know how we do it without over complicating. It is. Well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality. I guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together. So I, Ive talked myself out of not liking that. So, yeah. Good."
spk_5,37.20381667,37.41833333,"Cindys last blog post had a really good turn of phrase that I stole for for give out 14 when she was out, it was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that youre making it.  She said it really elegant
 and"
spk_1,37.42133333,37.52633333,"so I just deliverables, secure the software factory and its deliverables.  Yeah,
 I thought it was good to emphasize both"
spk_5,37.52898333,37.55681667,because they mean it was nice.
spk_1,37.60833333,37.76733333,Yeah. So you could say um secure and control your software factory and its deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts.
spk_0,37.84583333,37.94283333,"Im, Im not a big fan of the, its, its deliverables. Is there, uh, can we say like"
spk_4,37.95833333,38.04798333,"your software factory and your software or your, your software or in your product?"
spk_1,38.06316667,38.11716667,"Product? Sounds like  car manufacturer.
 I"
spk_3,38.12381667,38.20033333,"say IP, here, but it just doesnt sound right. And thats always, its always shorthand."
spk_0,38.21165,38.26215,"Yeah, I like this one better."
spk_1,38.31716667,38.39815,"Yeah, I think I do too but, but I appreciate the thought, Brian."
spk_0,38.42398333,39.9385,"Uh And then the last thing Ill say is so this is, this is my attempt to, to channel my inner Ash withers. Um I think Ash is like super good at just again, just like the the catchier like the turn of phrase element to it. Um And so like this kind of idea like single source of truth, countless possibilities or all in one for everyone. Theres something catchy about this. So, so here I was trying to like envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity? Its like its velocity with confidence is what is what you get? Um  I
 like your move fast with confidence better than increased speed and stay on track. Yeah, so I was trying to, I was thinking of like, you know, if youre like, if youre in a race car and like you go like super, super fast, like lets say youre in the bike race, right? And youre going so fast and somebody holds out the sign and then like half of the bike race collapses, right? Um So its almost kind of like you can, you can keep going like faster and faster and faster. And if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack, youre not gonna get tripped up by it because get labs, you know, its testing is gonna catch that and security is gonna catch that. Um, all of those elements that allow you to move faster, but to do so with confidence because otherwise youre like the faster you go then it gets more dangerous. So trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where I was like, stay on track, but I, I didnt like it either. You  just
 open"
spk_3,39.94266667,40.05966667,the door for NASCAR Partnership. Hey NASCAR goes fast and turns left because it get loud.
spk_4,40.11615,40.12048333,"So,"
spk_1,40.13933333,40.16215,Ricky demograph.
spk_0,40.17633333,40.34931667,"So yeah. So I dont think I like that one and then I think between these two, I like move fast with confidence, but I dont like the, the verbiage of it because it doesnt have parody. So thats where I think."
spk_2,40.35866667,40.64398333,"Do you wanna add, maybe we can add high confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement. So it kind of combines all of it. So more speed, less risk, high confidence, confidence  is kind
 of overused. Anyway, like I see a lot of competitors and vendors using it."
spk_3,40.64415,40.75516667,"I really like the first one just more speed, less risk. Bam no trade offs. You know, just that how it is. Mm"
spk_1,40.76666667,40.78816667,oh no trade offs.
spk_3,40.81283333,40.90698333,"Thats one of my go tos I love that one.  This,
 this gets into the uh"
spk_0,40.91565,41.2255,"no trade offs. The en the engineering me says theres never no tradeoffs. Thats like saying like 100% secure. Like this is why we always say mitigate, right? We always say like risk or less risk. You never say no with messaging, right? I mean, not everything, you know,"
spk_3,41.23565,41.28766667," not
 just more speed, less risk with confidence."
spk_4,41.31581667,41.32283333,Mm
spk_3,41.36733333,41.38016667,"But yeah,"
spk_4,41.41515,41.52633333,more speed. The Ricky Bobby and me really did like the no trade offs there. Parker.
spk_0,41.542,41.60016667," Oh, is that was that from?
 Uh no, but it could have been."
spk_4,41.60033333,41.69366667,"Its something Ricky Bobby would have said if anyone hasnt seen Talladega Nights,  they should, thats
 the homework for this weekend"
spk_3,41.70781667,41.76433333,to come back and we talk about it on Monday in our little social.
spk_0,41.77425,42.01256667,"I often say thank you little Â£8.05 ounce baby with the golden diapers. I say that so often that I just think everybody has seen Talladega Nights but then I realize that people that havent are like is really weird. And then,"
spk_4,42.01823333,42.11591667,"and then next week well watch Step Brothers.  Thats another great one. So much room for
 activities."
spk_0,42.1435,42.35215,"Ok. Um Im gonna go with uh more speed, less risk and um I think this is due at the end of the day. So any additional thoughts Im actually gonna un tag."
spk_3,42.37315,42.44131667,"Its strong. All those are, you know, cool.  Those
 are good."
spk_0,42.44898333,42.60248333,"Awesome. Well, uh, this was kind of fun to do a little bit of like working together session and, uh, keep it, keep it rocking."
spk_3,42.64098333,42.67048333,Good to see everybody. See you soon.
spk_3,31.76181667,31.83816667,"Uh I dont know. I usually let the designers handle that stuff. They, they,"
spk_4,31.84315,31.97465,"I, I like, I, I like the fact that theres no red on there."
spk_6,31.98566667,32.02415,"Oh You like that? Thats what I was going  for you.
 Like"
spk_4,32.03081667,32.52983333,"its not, its not obviously negative. Uh So were saying because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because theres no, you know, these folks at 37% are in the red and theyre terrible. They just have less green or we would have less green. So its, its not, its not being worse, its being less good. And I think that, I, I think that lends itself to working with, you know, all the co opet situations were talking about, you know."
spk_0,32.54898333,32.83465,"Yeah, thats, thats the goal is we want, we want to generate a helpful asset for the industry. This is not just like marketing chill, this should be like a helpful page. Uh So its like, yeah, the goal is to have a comparison comparing DEV ops tool is not a, you know, this is all of our competitors and why were better."
spk_6,32.84233333,33.19883333,"Yeah. Um iiii I think from a competitive mindset and for me, Im like, lets go hard, lets put some red on there and thats just the way I think, right. So, but I brought it up and that for now were gonna stick with the green. They recommend that we stick with the green and uh see how it goes. But I dont know,  I was feeling the red and yellow too
 so it is easy on the eyes and um its, you know,"
spk_3,33.19898333,33.24816667,"theres something to be said for that. So, yeah,"
spk_0,33.25866667,34.96465,"uh cool. Well, were almost up on time but I did wanna share one thing that kind of came in like basically Friday, it was like late Thursday for me. So this uh this is another thing, a lot, a lot of these things, I dont have like a ton of context on. Um I just know like were just trying to up our game. So like, hey, lets move fast and do the best we can do. Um So this is a little bit of a messaging framework and then the assignment that was given to me was to, to fill in these boxes here. So, uh and then this was the fodder that I got. So there was these ones that said like from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent and a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. Honestly, I think this ones really like, really pithy and catchy. Uh I really like it. Um I really liked uh whats the other one that I like? But not everyone does um all in one for everyone. So I just uh I dont know, I like, I just think so theres something catchy about that. Um But I know that kind of catchy is not everyones cup of tea. All that to say is um the assignment here was that I took, it was to write a pithy, few words like punchy statement for each of these three things. Uh So I ended up with a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. I like that a lot. Um This one I went with end to end control over your software factory, not as pithy but or like not as catchy, but um I like it."
