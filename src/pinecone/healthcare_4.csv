0,spk_0,0.00015,6.386816666666666,"Well, good morning everyone. Thank you so much for joining us. Um We have been doing this weekly. I think we are contemplating going back to a less um a schedule that might be every other week and we will let you know about that. Um which is good news, I think because it means that hopefully, things are not quite as chaotic as they have been. Um So our panelists today, youve ha uh weve had the pleasure of having them on before. Really glad to have them all back. Weve got Doctor Ruth Macdonald, whos the vice president and associate chief Medical Officer at Seattle Childrens. Um Theres always been an interest in the impact on pediatric patients. And I think also uh weve been talking about the vaccines for 5 to 11. Um Im very personally interested in this topic, so were excited to hear more about that. Uh Doctor Tim Deet, the Chief Medical Officer at Medicine, uh Riza Khalil, who is the chief executive of Cadillac Health System in uh the tricities. And that is a part of the state thats been particularly hit by COVID um throughout the pandemic really. And finally, Doctor Andrea Carter, whos the Chief medical Officer at Samaritan Healthcare and Moses Lake also from a part of the state thats um experienced more than its share of COVID. So really glad to have all of you. So Ill start with some opening comments and then Ill turn it over to our panelists for theirs. So first, the hospitalization rates continue to decline but the decline is slower. Um Unfortunately, its good that theyre declining and we wish they were declining faster. So there are 1025 COVID positive patients in hospitals uh this morning compared to 1101 that we reported at the same time last week. So it is a decline but we wish again, we wish it was more quick. Um There is not much of a decline. Actually, theres really no decline in patients who are on ventilators. This week, there are 100 and 84 patients on ventilators versus 100 and 85 that we reported last week. That is a different, its not the same 185 people who are on ventilators because what we know is that some people who are on ventilators, um some get better and some die. And so there is a change in the patient population. We wish that there was, this is a number we would really like to see going down faster because once patients are on a ventilator there. Um As youve heard in this briefing before, um their chance of survival goes down pretty significantly. So thats a number we would, we really would like to see go down and we continue to have about 10 or 15 deaths per day. That is also a decline, which is good news, but its still a ton. And I think I want to really emphasize that this is a new thing COVID clearly in our lives. If there was something else, I was thinking about this this morning, like, what else would it be if someone, if there was someone who was shooting 10 to 15 people a day or there was a car, a kind of a car that malfunctioned that caused crashes that killed the 1010 to 15 people a day in our state. I think the response from the public would be tremendous and it feels we continue to feel in the hospital community like people are just like theres more of a, a well, um about these COVID deaths and they are tragic. Every last one of them is tragic. Um And a huge loss for the community, for the family and we really want to do everything we can to prevent those. And as, as weve said, many times, vaccination is the number one way. Um The social distancing remains a really big issue. Um There was uh some information from the Department of Health that they shared with us last week showing that peoples social circles are becoming increasingly like if youre vaccinated. Your people are vaccinated, you know, your friends, your family tend to all be vaccinated. If youre unvaccinated, your people are largely unvaccinated. And so the clusters of, of risk for unvaccinated people grow even greater because theyre spending so much of their time around. Other folks who are unvaccinated, who are like more likely to get to transmit the disease to them. So thats a um thats really worrisome um information. Um Today is Vaccine Day. Um which means that by the end of the day, people have to have been vaccinated, proven that theyre vaccinated, uh or gotten an exemption and a accommodation or they cant work tomorrow. And so, uh leaders of hospitals and schools and uh ems and long term care organizations today, I would call that the hr employee health people are probably in a huge scramble today to try to get all this, this finished. Um We dont have new data about how many hospital employees are vaccinated. We will resurvey our members um likely the week of the 25th, we may, were gonna consult with our members to see if they would rather just wait till the first week of November. Um But in the next couple of weeks, we will, we will resurvey. There is some con you know, last week we reported that we had 88% staff vaccinated 12% a combination of things. Um either partially vaccinated, had applied for an exemption and it hadnt yet been reviewed or approved, um, or decided on or they hadnt turned in their forms and there has been some movement in that number where people who were in that 12% have either moved to partially vaccinated. Some of the partially vaccinated folks have gotten their second shot or may have completed their two weeks. Um, and then finally, people who ha had been vaccinated a long time ago who hadnt yet turned in their cards and so theyre turning in their cards, which is great. Um So, so theyre getting ve uh verification. So theres been um I think a lot of activity at the end of last week um over the weekend and probably till the end of today. Um So tomorrow will be the first day that really impacts us. Um We do continue to have concerns for sure about long term care and um the first responders, the ambulance and fire, um what we hear is that their vaccine rates are potentially lower than the hospital vaccine rates. And so that can, that has the potential to be to create kind of a cascading impact um across hospitals that patients cant get to the hospital or cant be transported to a hospital where they need to move or um if long term care cant accept patients who need to leave the hospital and weve seen an increase in the those patients who are difficult to discharge. So those are the things that were, that are on our mind today and I think um Doctor Dillard, Ill start with you for the um you know, what are you all seeing in the VAC, hows the vaccine? Um uh working at medicine? And what did you see over the last, the end of the week, at the beginning in this weekend?"
1,spk_1,6.39415,7.664316666666666,"Great. No, thank you. Uh Cassie. Um You know, and again, I just wanna emphasize, we very much are in support of the requirement that all healthcare workers be vaccinated. We need to maintain a safe environment for our patients and our staff. At the same time, the last couple of weeks, coming up to the 18th, have been very uh um anxiety ridden. I think for our teams, a lot of work by our hr personnel, by our employee health teams. Uh and we want everyone to be vaccinated. We dont want to lose any of our valued workers. Although at the end of the day, uh there are gonna be people who unfortunately no longer will be with our organization. Uh after today. Uh We, when you look at our staff, our medical staff and our trainees are at roughly 99% vaccinated. So were extremely happy with that uh number at the same time, it means that we probably have about 220 staff uh who wont be with us uh after today. And thats impactful. Its impactful for them, its impactful for their colleagues. Uh And so again, its something that, uh on one hand, were very pleased with our vaccination rates, but this is a lot of work. Uh And I dont think when the governor put in the proclamation, perhaps we had anticipated all of the logistical challenges of getting this implemented uh by uh today."
2,spk_0,7.719333333333333,7.877666666666666,"And do you wanna, uh doctor, do you wanna talk any about what youre seeing as far as cases and trends and, uh, and death rates in within the UD medicine system?"
3,spk_1,7.886666666666667,9.021916666666666,"Yeah, within our uh hospitals. Uh Today, we have, I believe, roughly uh 54 patients uh across our four hospital campuses. So as Cassie mentioned that has come down, but its kind of plateaued in that 50 to 60 range. Uh and of those uh 23 are within the IC U. So we still have many uh critically ill patients. The overall mortality rate for someone being admitted to our hospitals is around 21%. Again, the majority of those within the IC U. But thats one in five individuals with COVID19 who are admitted to the hospital, unfortunately die uh from that disease. And so it is having that impact, I think as Cassie mentioned, we were 21 months into this pandemic. I think theres almost a numbness or an unfortunate tolerance uh to seeing these numbers every day. Whereas early in the pandemic, uh they really struck a chord with the community and I think it just shows the prolonged nature of this pandemic and the impact that its having. But we cant lose sight of the impact that each of those deaths has uh not only on uh their families, but really our entire community."
4,spk_0,9.05715,9.132983333333334,"Thank you, Riza, love to hear from you about what youre experiencing the tricities."
5,spk_2,9.160833333333333,13.01965,"Yeah, very similar to, to elsewhere. We have seen our hospitalization numbers uh come down but still uh you know, for a hospital our size. So we run an average census anywhere around 2 4200 and 50 patients. Uh We had seen back in September when we were getting really nervous and we were quite gridlocked as many as 85 COVID positive patients. So, you know, um a third of our census um with COVID, uh were down into the thirties now most days. So today weve got 30 COVID positives uh in the hospital. Im very pleased to see that having come down so much, but its still not as low as it was even uh this past spring before the, the uh late summer surge started. So hoping to see that continue to come down uh over the course of the pandemic. I, I can tell you for us weve had um a little over 3200 hospitalizations here for COVID. So uh with all the ups and downs, thats whats come our way. Um About 260 have passed away in our hospital. So thats uh folks who are uh staff and team have, um, unfortunately had to help say goodbye to without families present for most of those, or at least only virtually. And thats been probably the biggest challenge we continue to hear about from our staff is, uh, the amount of, uh, emotional burden, uh, that theyre carrying on behalf of families and others who are unable to, unfortunately have visitation at the level that we had pre panic. Um, you know, the numbers in the tricities here in eastern Washington are still fairly high. I havent looked at the the latest, uh through the weekend but, uh, very pleased though that the hospitalizations have at least come down. But as youve heard from other facilities to some of our ability to open up census tragically has been through more deaths that have sped up more recently and have been in younger and younger patients in the past, um, in the past few months. So, uh, pleased to see the numbers coming down, but I still have a long way to go until were out of the woods with this. We have been able to take a little more by way of transfers of patients coming in. Finally, we were quite gridlocked, as I mentioned in September when we had our census in the eighties and uh very low staffing with the number of our staff that were out uh isolating due to COVID exposure or other things. But that uh situation is starting to open up a little bit, uh, which is helpful and then looking into the rest of the year hoping that, um, Thanksgiving and Christmas New Year dont bring another surge and that we continue going in the direction that weve been, uh, as far as staffing and uh, vaccinations and all those were doing pretty well. We are well above 90% compliant, either through vaccination or through appropriate exemptions at this point. Uh, the vast majority um through being vaccinated. So um that looks very positive. I would say the unfortunate thing that maybe is missing in that as we look at that data is the number of folks that weve lost prior to this. Uh folks that knew that there was a, a vaccine requirement coming and maybe chose to either leave health care or go somewhere where they thought maybe the the mandates would be a little different. And of course, we know whats happening in the future with some of the federal mandates. So that may be harder to do. But if you look at the number of staff that weve lost this year, uh We lost nearly a quarter of our IC U staff uh through through this year and weve replaced some of those positions and we have some travelers weve been able to fill but other key positions like that. I I think as we focus on whats going to happen with the vaccine mandate, now, Im less worried about this than whats happened in the many months preceding and the amount of turnover and vacancies were now trying to fill and everyones in the same situation with the hospitals, largely all competing with each other now across the country for a staff. And youve heard about all the travel contracts and what not going on. Um So that, thats about where we are, but overall feeling optimistic that were headed in the right direction, we just like to keep heading there faster and uh move through this."
6,spk_0,13.044833333333333,13.2345,"And would you, do you think that some of that departure of IC U staff is what you were describing earlier, the the accumulated grief of having to um lose so many patients and have them not have their families with them."
7,spk_2,13.249,14.0115,"Thats part of it. I think its a variety of things. Its uh certainly thats a part of it. I think theres a few who have tried and now these very lucrative travel assignments that folks that are mobile and flexible can take. Weve lost a few that have looked to do those and some that have, that have tried that and come back quite honestly. Uh I think those are a little bit harder and more challenging. Maybe, maybe sometimes some people understand and then others who have left for other reasons, maybe they were getting closer to retirement and decided that this was a good time to, to do something different and some who have stayed in the hospital, but just wanted to move out of the IC U because of that. And um, and the same is true with other, other departments too. Weve had turnover for a whole host of different reasons. But the pandemic in one way, shape or form usually is, is part of that."
8,spk_0,14.0255,14.1035,"Thank you, Doctor Carter. I guess that the view from Moses Lake."
9,spk_3,14.118166666666667,17.402666666666665,"Yeah. And I was listening to Doctor Khalil and its remarkable to me that although were just a 50 bed hospital here in the middle of um central Washington, our story is very similar to Doctor Khalil down in Cadillac. So or maybe not surprising given that were fairly close. So um here in Moses Lake, uh we are also very happy that we kind of got out of September, which was a very dark month for us. Uh We had better ability to um transfer patients to larger facilities as Doctor Khalil mentioned. However, even in our smaller hospital here, um we, our census is higher than its ever been. So our COVID patients thankfully have gone from the mid twenties on a daily basis to the mid teens. However, we still overcapacity on a daily basis with our hospital census, we have very sick patients, high acuity. Um so even non COVID, our I 12 bed IC U is full on a daily basis. Our 26 bed med surgeon is full on a daily basis. Were boarding patients um in the emergency department, weve experienced very similar um staffing issues. Um prior to this last week, wed only lost seven employees that would specifically state it was because of the vaccine mandate. Um However, we rely fairly heavily on staffing agencies where were at. We dont have a huge pool of, of staff otherwise. Um And with the cost of those staffing agency contracts, that is, um, its hurting us a little bit. Um And then this last week, we lost almost our entire materials management department um because specifically to the mandate, um weve had a fairly large rise in um people who have decided to retire. Um And then doctor like Doctor Khalil said, um a fairly large number of people that have chose to travel or move to other states where they, they may be believed that there was not gonna be a mandate in place. Um Over the course of 2021 weve had 23 deaths from um COVID, which does not seem like a lot. But again, imagine our census is much smaller than some of these larger facilities were talking to. Um And September was um a month that was um harder for us, harder for our staff. We were losing um multiple patients a week. Um And then just like Doctor Khalil said, we had many staff out so staffing issues with those um because of either exposure to COVID or positive COVID rates. Um So a very difficult month for us, we were happy to see October. Although the anxiety that came with the um impending October 18th date has also been very stressful for our staff for vaccines. We also are in compliance with the mandate. Um And again, weve had a little bit of a a rush the last several um days and over the weekend, um today, everybodys uh running around fairly frantically making sure everything is in order ready for midnight tonight. Um But overall, our, our meth message has always been educate and continue to encourage. So um even our employees who are in the process, us with just one vaccine or um have chosen a an exemption of some sort and been granted that we continue to educate and encourage vaccines across the board. Um And then our big hope for this week is um vaccines for the younger Children. So were looking forward to that."
10,spk_0,17.441833333333335,17.519166666666667,"Can you doctor Carter? Can you tell folks what materials management means?  You said youre sure.
 So,"
11,spk_3,17.523666666666667,18.011483333333334,"so its basically our warehouse. So the people making sure that we have the supplies that we need to keep functioning. So, uh when we were, I mean, thats really the, the sum of it. Um I think about the beginning of the, the, the COVID pandemic when we were looking for masks and P pe and um just keeping everybody supplied. If we didnt have materials management, I dont even know who would have done that job. So, um its hard to keep things stock when you dont have people purchasing and delivering and stocking our shelves."
12,spk_0,18.021983333333335,18.630983333333333,"That, that is one of the things that we know is that even in hospitals that have a high rate of vaccine among their clinical staff, they may have some of those supportive staff, you know, folks in accounting or um uh supply chain that, that could have a real impact on the functioning of the hospital. So thats some of the things that the hospital leaders are sorting through uh over the well be sorting through over the next week. All right, Doctor mcdonald, um we just heard about the vaccines, a little men of the vaccines for kids, um which were all really looking forward to. Uh  Thanks
 Cassie. Yes, we are very excited about"
13,spk_4,18.638816666666667,20.45765,"when the FDA will approve for emergency authorization use of vaccine in our younger Children. And we are ready to um work with the pediatric community to get um that vaccine out as soon as we hear the announcement. So very excited about that uh in terms of whats happening um in the pediatric community at Seattle Childrens. Fortunately, weve not seen the large numbers of COVID positive patients in in our hospital compared to our adult colleagues. So uh approximately anywhere from 3 to 15 patients have been admitted at one time with COVID uh positive um testing. And uh in August, we saw more of those in the adolescence. Uh and but in September, weve seen younger Children um admitted with COVID disease. So very concerning our workforce right now is approximately 98% fully vaccinated. And thats across um our whole uh workforce. Um not just the clinical workforce and uh approximately 1% are, have been, um at least partially vaccinated and were waiting for that time when theyre fully vaccinated. And the final 1% are those that uh submitted exemptions and were working hard to uh try to accommodate as much of as many of those as possible. We have not wanted to lose any of our workforce. So, but unfortunately, as uh Doctor Dalet mentioned, um some will need to go on uh administrative leave, but were really trying to work with every individual as much as possible to see what we can do to keep them with us."
14,spk_0,20.518833333333333,20.695833333333333,"Thank you. Is there any update Doctor mcdowell to the timeline for kids, the 5 to 11 or whats, whats your, what if you had to guess? Whats your best guess?  I,
 I am really hoping"
15,spk_4,20.704666666666668,20.969816666666667,"November uh early November would be um it would be fantastic if it would be before the end of this month, but uh were ready to go when it happens. Um So lets just hope that the FDA approves it as soon as possible."
16,spk_0,20.977666666666668,21.64765,"And I know the federal government is working on allowing um pre orders of the vaccine in anticipation of in, in hopes of its approval. Um Exactly great. And I, I wanna also highlight something Doctor mcdonald said which is that many hospitals rather than terminating staff are putting them on leave if theyre, if theyre not compliant with the vaccine mandate, um, in hopes that they will change and get vaccinated because its a lot easier to bring someone back from leave than, um, having to go if theyve been terminated to go through the rehire process. So thats, I dont know that every hi, are all of you doing that or some of, is it kind of a mixture"
17,spk_2,21.671,21.684,were doing that?
18,spk_1,21.703983333333333,22.15365,"You know, were putting, uh, individuals who have started the process. Uh, so if theyve started their vaccine, but wont be fully vaccinated, uh, say they got one dose, uh, this last week or two, then they could go on, uh, administrative leave, uh, until they are compliant. Similarly, those who, uh, received a denial of an exemption request have essentially 45 days to come into compliance. And so they could also be on leave during that period of time."
19,spk_0,22.163,22.679666666666666,"Right. And theres some folks who have a time, limited medical exemption as well. For example, if theyve had COVID and got monoclonal antibodies, you cant be vaccinated until that until the 90 days post. And so they may be on a, a medical exemption, but it has an expiration date. All right. We are, um, happy to take questions. I dont see any in the chat um, yet, but please put some in the chat or go ahead and speak up if youve got questions, I apologize."
20,spk_5,22.679833333333335,22.792666666666666,"This is Jessa mcintyre with box 13 in Seattle and I, I missed the opening comments there. That is a user error. Um"
21,spk_0,22.796666666666667,22.882166666666667,"So I,  I
 just wanted to revisit this is probably already discussed. Um,"
22,spk_4,22.882316666666668,22.897816666666667,but um
23,spk_5,22.900833333333335,23.012666666666668,"where the hospitalized, I know that the data probably wont come in for a few weeks.  But where is your confidence in your ability to
 retain most of your"
24,spk_0,23.012833333333333,23.977333333333334,"staff? Um Everyone can answer this, uh, directly. What we estimate statewide is that we will lose between two and 5% of hospital staff. That actually may be honestly a high estimate from what we heard over the weekend. Um, because we heard that there were people who, uh, moved to getting starting their vaccination series and, and then surpri surprisingly, I mean, I think this is like great news, but also probably makes the hr people tear their hair out. Theres a number of people who are, were fully vaccinated and they were fully vaccinated, you know, months and months ago, it just hadnt gotten around to turning in their cards and they turned in their cards on, you know, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. So theres some, uh, that, thats, uh, I mean, thats the greatest thing to find out that people actually are vaccinated. But thats, they, they probably were put, they were put in the estimate estimate of unvaccinated, but they were vaccinated. So other folks wanna share your confidence kind of how youre feeling about that."
25,spk_3,23.9965,24.1675,"Ok. Were pretty confident that, um, at this point, our numbers are pretty stable. We dont think were going to lose anybody tomorrow."
26,spk_1,24.242,24.548333333333332,"Yeah, as I mentioned, uh, earlier, um, you know, I, I think well lose less than 1%. Uh, unfortunately, right now there are about 220 of our staff who are not in compliance. Uh, and so, unless something changes, such as they start their vaccination today, uh they will be separated from us tomorrow."
27,spk_2,24.644666666666666,24.976316666666666,"We have a fairly small number that thats at risk just to repeat that again. And my, my bigger concern that I mentioned earlier in the opening comments was more along the lines of the number of staff that weve already lost a year to date for various reasons and uh kind of where that puts us going forward. But the, the change as of today going in tomorrow, we dont think is gonna incrementally add a large number to that."
28,spk_4,25.015,25.209983333333334,"And we expect that we will have some that go on administrative leave,  but were really working hard to um really minimize that um across our
 workforce."
29,spk_0,25.230166666666666,25.91365,"When you look at the reports out of New York and California, there are a lot of folks who move from not, I mean, I mean, not theres still people who lost their, lost their jobs. There are also a substantial number of people who move from leave to starting the vaccine process. Um So were hopeful that will be the case as well. Um Is a question about uh so Kate, let me know if that answered your question about uh how, how many your question was, do any of the hospital leaders on the call and know how many, if any people will be dismissed tomorrow? Um Doctor Carter, do you have any specific numbers of how many folks you think will, will leave? I guess youre, youre putting folks on leave, right? So youre not.  So,
 so um"
30,spk_3,25.925833333333333,26.191316666666665,"I would say the same thing Doctor Khalil said weve had a fair amount of loss over the course of the year because of um early retirements or choosing to move away. But um the difference between today and tomorrow really, um I, we dont anticipate a big number between today and tomorrow."
31,spk_0,26.21165,26.60781666666667,"Great. Thank you. Um Are rural hospitals still going to be hardest impacted by the vaccine mandate? Yes. Um rural eastern Washington, especially rural Western Washington is actually in better shape. Um Not thats not a fully across the board, but, you know, communities like Port Townsend, um theyve got a higher vaccination rate than um than some of the eastern Washington communities, you know, go ahead."
32,spk_1,26.611333333333334,27.499316666666665,"Ok. I was just gonna add, you know, I think even though we look at some of the, the smaller hospitals, rural hospitals that may potentially be individually harder uh impacted ultimately though uh our state is so interconnected with respect to the healthcare system, uh that any loss impacts all of us. Because if we have a reduction in services in one area or reduction in beds in an area, it impacts all of us as weve seen, given the overall capacity constraints. And so thats one of the things that were really looking at as well. And we have to think about how is this across the state and almost thinking of us as one system. Uh when we look at the impact of this mandate uh here uh going forward because as others have said, were all stretched uh from a staffing uh standpoint. And so any impact anywhere within our state is gonna have at least a ripple effect across the state."
33,spk_0,27.536816666666667,28.746166666666667,"Thank you. Um ok. Uh What are the contingency plans for hiring more workers to replace those who are leaving, especially the rural hospitals that are losing a greater percentage? Um Ill make some comments and invite others to come in as well. Everybodys looking for staff. So whether its trying to hire new staff or traveler contracts or um theres another question about the federal resources coming into hospitals. There is potentially there, there should be some staff resources that are available to hospitals. Um Everyone is looking and trying to fill those, those places. We will see a, a curtailing of services. Theres no question about that. Um People are going to cap it as Doctor Della just described, theres gonna be caps on admissions in some rural hospitals theres going to be um closing down of some service lines potentially or um having people have to wait longer for elective or non urgent procedures or for outpatient services. So there that its both a goal to hire more staff, but also to figure out how do you reconfigure services in a way that you can cover it with the staff that youve got. Anybody else wanna comment on that things that strategies youre using to cover for the staff that have gone."
34,spk_3,28.785833333333333,29.84723333333333,"Unfortunately, Moses Lake just like other places. Um Weve had to reduce our services in our or um and some of that is hospital bed availability. Some of that is staffing. We have to use those valuable nurses and other places in the hospital to take care of acutely ill people. Um We, we earlier in the year did set up in the clinic at least um ma apprenticeships to help build our MA program. We have a, a nursing school of nursing school and an ma school here in town. Thankfully. So we have nurse tech programs in the er to help build that supply. Um Our CNO has developed a, a buddy program if you will. So if we can borrow from the clinic and bring him into the hospital um and have them tasking with other licensed nurses. We had kind of gone away from using LP NS um and using MA S in our clinic and our hospital. But we now are um looking at L LP NS as um source resources for us. Um But unfortunately, I think youre right, Cassie. There comes a point where we just have to cap what we can do here at the hospital if we dont have the staffing to, to accommodate that."
35,spk_0,29.88715,30.1815,"Thank you. Um Whitney Ward sent a question saying explain more about how the reduction in services will impact Samaritan. But I think that question might have been coming in as Doctor Carter was speaking. So if you need more information, will you put that back in the chat? I, I think that she answered that Doctor Carter, anything else you would say about that?"
36,spk_3,30.212316666666666,30.231833333333334,I think I answered it unless
37,spk_0,30.245833333333334,30.895833333333332,"I think, I think it was kind of a simultaneous, you know, you were speaking as the question was coming in. I believe um Doctor Dett put in the chat that the um FD advisory committee is meeting October 26th to review the data for Children. 5 to 11 years old. Ive been telling my 10 year old that this is going to be the best Halloween treat ever that he could potentially get vaccinated at Halloween week. Hes very excited. Um Lets see, update on federal resources coming into hospitals. So, um Taa Riley, would you be willing to take this question? I think youre closer to whats happening with the AC I contract if youre still on, stay still on? Yep, Im here."
38,spk_6,30.932166666666667,31.57815,"I honestly, Im not sure if Ive got a whole lot more than you do. I know that um the hospitals are able to um apply right now and that Dey has got a, the Department of State Department of Health has a system that has been set up for that. Um And the other good news is that the state has secured um funding for COVID only um hospital care that is provided um through the agency staff from FEMA. So thats the other uh piece of good news about that contract. I dont know, Cassie, if that, Ive got a whole lot more to share than that."
39,spk_0,31.584483333333335,33.9155,"I I know that a number quite a few hospitals have applied to the state for the staff. The tricky piece as Taa just described is that in order to receive federal funding for the staff, they have to be doing only COVID care and so to have. So the hospitals are trying to think about how can they manage having a staff person who comes, who, you know, is working in the IC U and is like, cant touch someone whos there because they had a heart attack. They have, you know, they can only focus on the COVID patients. I think its possible but it does make it um less helpful to a rural hospital that might have, you know, only one COVID patient. Um for example, um but any have any of you applied for the uh to be a site for the staff to go to the federal staff. No. OK. All right. Um So another question given the impacts we mentioned with some staff loss and curtailing of services. What do we say to people who argue that vaccine mandate should have given more wiggle room to avoid impacts to services? I will say this has been an incredibly thorny question. Um Among the hospital leadership in the state, two really important goals that we are facing here. One is we want as many staff as possible to be vaccinated. It protects the staff, it protects their patients. And if you get an outbreak in a hospital, you the in this, you know, you could end up quarantining a ton of staff, um impacting a ton of patients. And so you could actually cripple yourself more significantly. But the other goal is to keep the health sys system functioning as much as possible and to be able to serve as many people as possible. And those goals sometimes work together and sometimes theyre in conflict. And so um we have maintained, we have not requested changes to the vaccine mandate as an association. We do have some members who would like to see changes, but it is not um thats not been a consensus position among our membership. Um Weve really been focusing on trying to help our hospitals as much as possible. Um implement the mandate. Uh do provide accommodations to those who receive exemptions, uh do good education of their staff. But it is, its a, uh its a really tricky question. Um Anybody wanna comment on it,"
40,spk_2,33.9755,35.32815,"you know, theres a lot of variables. I guess the one thing I, I would say is prior to this, uh being mandated, we were, we were kind of capped out at a certain level of, of vaccination while it was voluntary. Uh with all the things we were doing to try to get it higher, it was just not moving and having the uh the mandate has really moved up our vaccine compliance as youve heard today. Uh quite, quite a bit. So, I guess the question becomes, um, whats, whats the upside? Whats the downside? I, I, yes, there are some, uh in our case, a small number of probably of folks, we may lose due to the, due to the mandate. But if we have a, a requisite number of folks that are kept safe and can stay in staffing because theyre not at home isolating because theyre avoiding getting sick and those kinds of things from a staffing perspective. Um Hopefully that will balance out and be a net positive for us. And then, uh just from the standpoint of believing that our workforce in health care in order to protect the patients that were serving uh in here as well as themselves, should get vaccinated. Uh It, it certainly lines up with our organizations beliefs and where were headed. So well, well see how the numbers play out. But Im hopeful that the number of additional, that weve uh managed to get vaccinated because of the mandate will help keep everybody safe and keep staffing actually stronger in the long run."
41,spk_1,35.36581666666667,37.0845,"You know, I agree. I think um there is a tension there as Cassie uh mentioned. At the same time, we know these vaccines are safe and effective. If you look in King County, uh if you are unvaccinated, you have a ninefold greater likelihood of getting infected, a 50 fold, greater likelihood of being hospitalized and over a 60 fold likelihood of dying from COVID19. And as Cassie mentioned, we continue to have 15 to 20 deaths across the state uh each day or I mean, each week. So this is something that we need to address. We feel very strongly that we have an obligation to create a safe environment for our patients, for our staff. We care for a lot of immunocompromised patients who often cant mount uh an immune responsive the vaccine themselves. Weve seen outbreaks among our healthcare workers. Now, many of those are from acquisition within the community, but if theyre infected there and then come back in uh there is that risk of transmission to coworkers uh and patients. And so we believe that we do need to keep a safe environment. And when you look at the exemption request that we received, we received a little over 400 we approved about a third. But what was interesting is that of those who had their exemption request denied the majority went on to start the vaccination series. And so overall, we have seen this increase in vaccination rates through this mandate. Uh And again, we recognize the challenges and that tension particularly with staffing. Uh But we really feel that this as uh Risa just said, its in alignment with our values and our obligation as healthcare workers and healthcare organizations."
42,spk_4,37.117333333333335,38.093,"Uh I just wanna echo what uh what Tim said in, in our, in our hospital, very, very vulnerable pediatric population, most of which are not vaccinated and really excited to see, hopefully by the end of the month that the 5 to 11 year olds will be able to start their vaccine. But of all of those that are patients, many of them are immune compromised and we really feel strongly that we have to protect our patients, our families um and our workforce um from contracting COVID um disease. So its really critical and I also wanna put in a uh mention that people should also get their flu vaccine this year. Im really concerned that as more and more um people are out in the public that we will see a surge um of flu um coming in the coming months and uh just really um just wanna double down on the nece the necessity of getting that vaccine as well."
43,spk_0,38.168816666666665,39.94031666666667,"Any other comments about that? Um You know, I actually wanted to co doctor uh uh mcdonald. When you were talking, it reminded me of something you said earlier that we havent seen the as high a pediatric cases as some other states have seen. And we wanna give, I wanna give huge gratitude to our governor for having uh the rule about you got to wear masks in schools and sticking to it. We find absolutely baffling other governors saying that you not only like, like actively discouraging them wearing masks in schools. Um It is so nice to have kids go to school and feel like um theres a lot of, theres, there are barriers of protection for them. Um So huge kudos to Governor Insley for that. Um ok, another question with staffing shortages, driving up wages and incentives for positions like travel nurses. It sounds like youre losing some folks to those higher paying travel positions. How do you create a long term solution to that? Um One thing that we are involved in um in partnership with the American Hospital Association is asking the Federal Attorney General to look at the sta travel staffing contracts because the prices are just remarkably high and also how much of that money is going directly to the workers versus um to the agencies. So it really is a national issue. Its happening all around the country. But other other thoughts about how to create a um long term solutions to that for folks who are taking the higher paying travel positions and maybe, um, Risa, you might comment on people coming back from travel contracts because Ive heard that as well that like you go to a city, you dont know anybody. Youre in a, you know, youre in some kind of like temporary housing and you dont know the team and you dont know the hospital, you dont know how it works and its, uh, we have heard for sure that some folks who have tried it, it turns out they dont really like it."
44,spk_2,39.962316666666666,41.68873333333333,"Yeah, I think thats a tough gig for, for all the reasons you mentioned, Cassie and, and for us. Uh and, and probably somewhere, Im sure my colleagues on the call here today continuing to focus on all the things. Weve always tried to focus on having a, having a great culture and having a um a place that people want to work and, you know, keeping our people that have been here for many years, uh dedicated support in whatever ways we can knowing that its been a challenge. I think people are frustrated on a whole lot of different levels. Uh probably at any organization they work with these days, but trying to really focus on caring for and retaining the people that we have here is uh really been our major focus and these travel uh positions. I know that the prices go up and down depending on the situation that thats going on. And, you know, as the, as the curve, the epidemiological curve starts to come down and things change. I expect that the um the wages on those travel positions will start to come, come down as well and be hopefully a little bit less um tempting for folks. But theres no, no magic bullet to this. I think just trying to create as good of an environment as possible for folks in healthcare in general. So that we have more people wanting to come into the workforce and be part of this. And its still an amazing thing to be part of and that people are intrinsically motivated on so many levels to to be part of um hospitals and other healthcare organizations. So I think its all those things. And again, we, we have a lot going on right now with people competing with sign on bonuses and all sorts of stuff all over the country trying to pull a staff here and there. But at some level, Im sure folks like to be able to stay where they are and grow with a team that they are part of and we will all continue focusing on those things as well. So I dont think theres any silver bullet answer to this other than continue to focus on all the things that we know are the right things."
45,spk_1,41.71383333333333,42.6425,"I think Risa uh made a really good point earlier on uh that I think that the overall staffing challenges, yes, there will be some impact from the mandate, but thats not the primary impact. The primary impact is the last 21 months of going through this pandemic and the exhaustion and fatigue uh that our staff are feeling. Um Weve also from the mandate standpoint, had many staff who are actually pleased that we are creating an environment that is safe for them. They want to work with individuals who are vaccinated and our patients are asking uh about the vaccination status of those caring for them. Uh So I think many people are actually very glad that we are requiring uh vaccination uh within our facilities as well. The bigger issue like Reza said is just how do we really support our people, the resilience and as we even come out of this pandemic, uh thats got to be our primary focus uh across all of our organizations is how would we best support our people?"
46,spk_0,42.71998333333333,42.901666666666664,"Ok, Risa, a question for you. Do you anticipate an increased census uh due to cutbacks at rural hospitals after the vaccine mandate. Do you think youre going to be receiving more patients out of rural hospitals?"
47,spk_2,42.922983333333335,43.95315,"I think maybe and again, it comes down to the, to the numbers when we were back in September and we saw the disease curve going this way. And so our staffing curve going going the other way that obviously, it was not a great combination for, for anybody, but as we see the curve start to flatten and come down, uh at the same time, as, as I know, we are seeing some of these staffing challenges in rural hospitals. It just depends on the degree to which those curves move in tandem. And my hope is that the uh disease incidence continues to come down even as some of those staffing challenges occur. Thats certainly what were, were seeing here. Our staffing hasnt gotten um, that much better, but it has gotten a little bit better as weve seen the the disease incidents uh come down and we are able now to accept more of those transfers in. So I hope a combination of uh us being able to accept more if there is a need for it. And then in those rural communities, um their disease incidents starting to come down even as some of their staffing is challenged, um hopefully we will keep us pretty stable, but well see, we, we need to be prepared if it does surge back up again. And, and we certainly will"
48,spk_0,43.981,44.43615,"thank you. Um are hospitals considering requiring an additional or booster dose for staff members in the future? And then maybe a correlator that Ill ask this question is, how many staff are you seeing voluntarily seeking out the booster, the booster dose? Are you tracking that? And just to remind folks, its only for pfizer. So like I have, I have got the Moderna shot, so Im not currently eligible for a booster and um so that its a, its a subset of people who um who can get a booster right now."
49,spk_2,44.50116666666667,44.714166666666664,"We have no plans to require it currently, but we have seen a number of staff that are taking advantage of that that can and I, I dont have any numbers to share, but I certainly encouraging those that can to do that. But no, no plans to require it currently."
50,spk_1,44.74166666666667,44.75066666666667,Weve done.
51,spk_4,44.76266666666667,45.13783333333333,"Ok. Go ahead. Weve had uh a pretty significant number of our staff that um were eligible to get the Pfizer booster. Go ahead and, and get it. So our vaccine clinic has been relatively um full and um we are not requiring it though. Uh Its still under an eu a and at some point in the future, um we very well may be requiring it"
52,spk_0,45.18631666666667,45.21098333333333,di it. How about you? Anything different?
53,spk_1,45.233333333333334,45.68148333333333,"Uh No, I dont have uh numbers. And again, its only those who got Pfizer um in terms of the booster and we havent had conversations. I, I think we need to wait and see where things uh go. Um Could it be that theres uh an annual need uh for a Coronavirus vaccine just like there is with influenza potentially? I I think were just not there yet in terms of us seeing the data got and what the recommendations from us that we see will be in the future."
54,spk_0,45.735,45.76531666666666,"Doctor Carter, anything you wanna add."
55,spk_3,45.774483333333336,45.873983333333335,"Uh Were currently not requiring it, but we have a fair amount of our um people who flies are eligible that have been in line to get it"
56,spk_0,45.897666666666666,46.06531666666667,"and it sounds like there may be some more um booster possibilities, especially for Johnson and Johnson recipients in the next couple of weeks. Doctor Dett, any update you have about that."
57,spk_1,46.09048333333333,47.409166666666664,"Well, the FDA uh advisory panel met last week. And so I think both with Moderna and Johnson and Johnson, I think they are coming out with recommendations uh for booster now goes through uh the advisory committee on immunization practices from the CDC. And then ultimately, the CDC director, uh as we saw with Pfizer, uh the CDC director um uh had a different recommendation than uh the advisory committee. So I think by the end of this week, well have a better sense uh in terms of potential boosters, uh both for Moderna and Johnson and Johnson and Johnson and Johnson, Ill just say, I dont know where this will end. Um But you know, theres also a discussion of uh should that booster be with a second dose of Johnson and Johnson or should that second dose be with an MRN A vaccine? Uh Theres an NIH study that suggests that there may be a better immune response with an MRN A vaccine. Uh countries in Europe have experience with that, particularly with the astrazeneca, which is analogous to the Johnson and Johnson. So um Im not sure where thats all gonna shake out uh yet. Uh And so hopefully by the end of this week, well have some more clarity, but I would anticipate uh that both of those uh groups will be eligible for boosters. Its just not entirely clear what the Johnson and Johnson, will it only be for the Johnson and Johnson or will they allow an MRN a uh vaccine as the booster?"
58,spk_0,47.435,47.92015,"Thank you. And um also I wanted to share some other information I was thinking about, about the pediatric vaccine, which is that its going to be packaged differently than the, the pediatric Pfizer. Its gonna be packaged differently and its a different strength. Its a third of the strength of the adult strength. Um So its, its uh you have to go to a place that has the pediatric vaccine in order to get your 5 to 11 vaccinated. So I assume Doctor mcdowell that Children will be stocking in quite a bit of this vaccine."
59,spk_4,47.94048333333333,48.43615,"Um Absolutely. And we will also be um having it at Odessa Brown uh childrens uh clinic um as well. And so we will also wanna do our best to reach out to the bio community f and that families and get those Children in. So we expect that well be really active in promoting a vaccination and working with the university um as well. Um Theyve been really fantastic partners um uh for us in um vaccinating our community. So, thank you."
60,spk_0,48.46065,49.97865,"I know lots of schools are working on this as well. Ive gotten this information from my kids schools but theyre, theyre thinking about their vaccine clinic. All right. Thats all of our questions. Um, uh, we are, one thing we didnt talk about was the federal vaccine mandate, which we still dont have a date for. Um, we were, were expecting to receive the interim final rule. Um, I dont believe thats come out. Has anybody seen no ones seen a federal, the federal rule? Ive been tracking as much honestly because the state rule we think is at least as strong as the federal one. Probably strong. It has not come out. Um So, and then that would probably be effective, you know, required 60 days or something after it come, the rule comes out. So thats, that will uh have an impact across the country, but it, we dont believe it will affect our uh vaccine requirement at all because we think ours is, uh as I said, at least as strong, if not stronger than the federal one. All right. Thanks so much for joining us. We will plan, were not planning to have a briefing next week, but we plan to have one on the first of November. And so well um hope that nothing happens between now and then that would require us to um to do this because usually it means some tragedy is taking place or cases are skyrocketing. Um uh I hope that folks have a safe Halloween and, you know, still the mother trick or treating, get out and do the trick or treating, but wear your mask and be careful. Um And well see you again in a couple of weeks. Thanks a lot. Thanks to our panelists so much for joining us. Really appreciate your time"
61,spk_4,49.997,50.11416666666667,and lets hope on November 1st that well have great news about Children 5 to 11 being able to be vaccinated. Yes.
62,spk_0,50.147983333333336,50.16,Thank you.
