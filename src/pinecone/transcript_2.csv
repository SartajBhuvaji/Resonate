spk_1,12.66765,12.81466667,Harsh responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about ha having him sort of stack ranked.
spk_0,12.84048333,13.64665,"Yeah, I might, I might even constrain this is were not going to highlight lo segments, but we want to see the full spectrum, especially in the case we have slim pickings alternately uh if they are double digit entries, then we can stack rank. Um So thats, thats kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these that, I mean, it looks like were gonna get there and thats gonna be quite a lot of features. So um I might constrain it like this. Maybe you can only give out 112 or three and, and, and treated as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level. That doesnt necessarily"
spk_1,13.65198333,13.789,hard to somebodys one or somebodys 3 may be more important than somebody elses one depending on the
spk_5,13.80065,14.07,"and I had um I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year uh from, from create and, you know, there are at least a dozen things that Im not mentioning. Uh that could be on the list. Like I could give you 10 things instead of three,"
spk_0,14.07881667,14.7355,"give it, give this just like the rough like pass and um like a lot of things recently, Ive been moving between docs and spreadsheets and the spreadsheet to docs. Uh This, you know, this might, this might end up or some iteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in pr is like, OK, out of all of like the, you know, theres maybe 10 boxes here and three each out of the 30 items which are the top five. Um Actually, lets just, lets actually just do that, lets just do this like top, top five overall.  We, so this
 one is apr driven to some degree."
spk_5,14.73566667,14.83333333,"What about like a New and Christies uh product keynote at commit?  Are we that tailing this with
 that?"
spk_0,14.83731667,15.73181667,"So, so this is exactly where this is headed to um is the idea that um during the product keynote and then ideally during Kid Sids keynote as well that theres some level of like an announcement that we make that. Then the press cares about that announcement. Um Again, really tough to do at cl because its all been around for a while. So this is this is our attempt to head to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event and yeah, maybe its some things that have been around for a while, but like now theyre at a level of maturity now, you know, theres, theres a reason to be excited about this. So thats kind of where its coming from. So I put uh a top five overall. Maybe we can just, uh you know,"
spk_4,15.81983333,15.98398333,"we should reserve a spot for plan, but Im gonna have to go through and do some aggregating after this. Just go through the list of what shift in the last 12 months and re bucket that."
spk_0,16.025,16.40233333,"So, uh maybe we can do like a five minutes kind of like um just, just time box and uh kind of look at these here. What do you, what do you all think is a top would be a top five out of the list of, you know, 20 or 30."
spk_5,16.448,16.641,"I would say if UX does end up being a, a flag that we fly, thats an easy one because theres more than just maps to the created stage that would be considered UX improvement. OK."
spk_1,16.77998333,17.23816667,"What else we need to have a security one in there. We could have either vulnerability management or, um, I was, what Ive been struggling with a little bit is Id like to kind of group the, um, some of this, the proprietary scanning, um, without making it sound like theyre scanning improvements because that sounds like they werent good before."
spk_0,17.25016667,17.52231667,"Yeah, I, lets, lets go with vulnerability management for now. II, I would agree on that one and I would say that um some of these, we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing. So we might not get that"
spk_1,17.52933333,17.64266667,"old. I was, I mean, we did the fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago."
spk_0,17.66766667,17.80381667,"Was it within the past year for longer? I thought it was  within the past year. I
 think it was in the last"
spk_2,17.80883333,17.83966667,"six, little over six months or"
spk_3,17.84148333,17.92448333,"so. It was,  it was
 like last spring or summer and then we"
spk_1,17.92465,18.21198333,"did another set of press around the integration of it because the pr team liked all the, I mean, we got a lot of attention on the acquisition. So they had me do a follow up um on the integration.  I just feel like its kind of worn out
 now, but"
spk_0,18.21981667,18.35731667,"right, thats what I was saying is that the, the fuzzing we already did press on so probably will not get another chomp at that. So I think lets go with Vulnerability management"
spk_3,18.37265,18.40683333,"UN review, but we also have"
spk_1,18.41666667,18.93583333,"in terms of proprietary stuff. Weve also got, we replaced one of our scanners with SEM group and we did um we have our own proprietary DAS scanner now thats in, its in beta uh called browser. So its our answer to scanning single page applications which represent a unique challenge. I think. I mean, if I could have to, it would be vulnerability management and berserker probably."
spk_0,18.94715,18.96716667,OK. Sere
spk_5,18.97333333,19.04498333,"did get picked up as a line item and a couple of the pieces about get back 14,"
spk_0,19.13698333,19.25466667,"which uh between between the, the proprietary shifts of the vulnerability management, which would you pick as the number one out of those two?"
spk_1,19.286,19.31483333,Probably vulnerability management?
spk_0,19.32281667,19.60565,OK. Im just kind of scanning the list. I would probably say like Cooper Nets agent is something that weve made a lot of investment in. Although um I
spk_2,19.61316667,19.87831667,"think the CIN agent and uh from an integration point of view, uh perhaps the terra farm integration, I think we have a, a lot of customers actually using that already. So I, I"
spk_0,19.90181667,20.72431667,"Im just gonna call those get ops and Im gonna put like KS agents plus has she for integrations? Its like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about. Uh I Yep, cool. Well, lets, you know, lets try to uh this is due Tuesday. I think we wanna try to get this done. Um So maybe just uh review this kind of like lets just kind of pick top five maybe something from plant something from C I CD.  Uh pipeline
 editor is definitely an option for C I CD."
spk_3,20.73298333,20.74281667,Um
spk_4,20.76215,20.78065,"Yeah, and there might be a"
spk_3,20.80181667,20.8065,"sorry,"
spk_4,20.8135,21.05066667,"no, sorry. There, there might be a value stream analytics story in there too. Um If we aggregate it all, its, its a bummer that customizable value stream analytics is 12 dot night. Um But uh yeah, yeah, there might be"
spk_0,21.1005,21.34931667,"cool. Im just gonna, Im gonna ping you on this cormac to add, add a, a top five plan. Cool. Uh I think"
