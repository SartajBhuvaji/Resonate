spk_0,0.00015,1.190316667,"I can record and we dont have a ton of items to get to, uh and I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time. Um So corporate events, uh they, I think I saw a little, I put this in, in slack and I saw a little bit of uh kind of noise around it, which was good. Um You know, the, the nutshell here is as weve kind of restructured and tried different things. Um The event support that we need isnt as nailed down as it needs to be. Uh So the current tactic that were going with is go to market team signs up and kind of s sponsors that event. So you support as a PM M, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Uh I dont see anyone in the uh maybe there are comments in the issue. I dont see the, the header updated yet."
spk_1,1.203483333,1.265166667,I thought we had in Slack sort of farmed each one of them out.
spk_0,1.277666667,1.901833333,"Thats so I guess that the next, so it looks like Thai put in some folks it looks like this looks good. So that, lets see, need support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would be, um, to work with your GTM team. So, so did, let me ask it, I saw some slack, I think in our Slack. But did, did you all, uh, were you all able to connect with like your GTM teams,"
spk_2,1.947316667,2.00765,"uh, on Slack only and on the issue actually?"
spk_3,2.014333333,2.270333333,"Yeah, same, not in, not in real time, but, you know, source feedback. I got one person to respond so far. So it may end up Cindy being you and I just picking the one that we want to do and then they can back and set up um If we dont get any more feedback."
spk_0,2.3095,2.444833333,"Yeah. Do you all um Does anybody have like a, a regular sink still? Are those all been canceled or is there"
spk_4,2.48,2.509816667,in case you still have a regular sick?
spk_5,2.5225,2.5605," Yeah, were on like a two week
 cadence."
spk_0,2.564666667,2.57315,Ok.
spk_2,2.582983333,2.6615,"Yeah, GS has been canceled um after the enablement."
spk_0,2.70465,2.998316667,Cool. So Im just trying to catch up with the thread. Um So it looks like maybe a platform on re invent C I CD on Google next and gets on coupon. Does that sound right?
spk_3,3.025483333,3.05065,Thats where we were last I heard.
spk_0,3.066816667,4.012833333,"Cool. So then I think, um I think we can, we can help the Corp events team. They do, they do a lot of like a cat herding and, you know, keep on tracking people down. So I think if, if this team can take the mission to, like, try to help track that down. So, if you, you know, get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, like were, were signing up for a coupon, you know, can you comment on the issue that yes, I can commit to this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you know. Um So that just so that they can get that, that event support, but that looks good. And I appreciate uh thanks for the link too, Sonia on the roles ah product announcements. So I appreciate you Brian for adding this. I uh I probably should have added it, but"
spk_1,4.039483333,4.137333333,I had two questions about that. 11 is over. What time frame are we looking at?
spk_0,4.159816667,5.810316667,"So, uh so in theory, this is this could be the same as the Gab 14 launch where were saying basically since 13.0 what has, you know, what kind of big improvements have we made? Um Candidly, this is always a little bit tough and Im and Im, I am not totally sure of all of the kind of the interplay here, but I think I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment is OK, we have commit coming up. We have some amount of like we have a stage of, you know, a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and well get some amount of press attention because were having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make? Um at git lab, its really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire roadmap is completely public, yada yada yada. So the thought here is to, but also because our entire road map is completely public and because we ship these tiny little NBC S and a new feature will come out, but itll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say, OK, like what started in the last year, but now is really like a full fledged feature. What would, what would be coming out of beta, right? Like if we were any other company, when we started a beta program in this last year, what would we be announcing is G A at commit? Thats kind of, thats kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of head. Nos. What do you think, Sydney?"
spk_1,5.837816667,6.326483333,"Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say like vulnerability management because there were tiny little MV CS all the way along. But if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this, it makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual little thing. And then the other point was we just had 14.0 can we just, can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here."
spk_0,6.32965,6.708816667,"Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And vulnerability management was, was one of the, you know, the features out of we, we looked at 14.0. So I think, yeah, this is like, lets take the stuff from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or give, give our pr team. This is kind of like input into our pr team to give them fodder to go out with."
spk_1,6.714983333,6.754983333,And are we trying to hit three per stage?
spk_0,6.766483333,7.143483333,"I, yeah, ideally, theres just, you know, three, you know, uh three items per stage. And then I think yall made some good notes that OK, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here. Thats excellent. Um And uh integrations we dont, well, actually we have some pretty exciting integration. So we have the,  the Jira stuff
 is pretty good."
spk_5,7.14365,9.009833333,"Theres a couple of things in uh integrations with VS code that could be notable, but I can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it. And if someone hasnt done it, maybe thatll also kick I was going Cindys direction here, which was uh thinking, you know, a lot of, and then I call them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall. So we would have like one thing to call them. Uh Theres several key iterations aligned with uh giddily cluster, uh several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like I, I was shy and calling out UX as, as a bucket except that actually thats, thats super typical, right? Like Windows 11 or anybody whos rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things and then they mentioned a laundry list of stuff that aligns to that. Um So I, I, you know, forgave myself, uh for doing something. At first, I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and, and bucketing some things there. But actually, when I looked around, thats pretty much how everybody does, um, a big launch and in terms of the excitement level that also, like I went in thinking this is just a two, I guess part of it is like, I feel like were almost fixing something thats broken and thats not something you want to shout from the rooftops about, but actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasnt sure exactly where to place things. Um But I figured I wouldnt, uh like the Cindys comment have something thats one here anyway. But I, the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to, to bucket them with something. And, uh, so thats kind of how I came down on it. I dont know what everyone thinks about that."
spk_4,9.073483333,9.097816667,"Yeah. II, I like that."
spk_2,9.130666667,9.511666667,"I know Ive done a similar, Ive taken a similar approach for monitor. Um, with incident management, there were a bunch of things that we released. Um, although the core of incident management was part of 12 dot X. I think so. Um I did the same over there as well. Yeah,  I think that makes
 sense."
spk_4,9.516483333,10.26431667,"Yeah. And that, that would help me with the planned stuff as well because there are some things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they finally have and thats great. But um I think, you know, like the the milestone burn up charts that that was a two and thats, thats helpful and I was looking through features and you know, a actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but its not very exciting, but we can bundle that with some other things and, and, and up level it so that that would be helpful there. And also Brian about the VS code thing. One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month were um community contributions, which is also kind of cool"
spk_0,10.29765,10.367,"is, is that, is, do we have VS code listed on here?"
spk_5,10.397,10.5865,"I didnt add it but I can, I can add that in. Ive got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of the things,  but theres some other stuff thats a little juicier
 than that"
spk_0,10.63683333,11.02898333,"and that, I think thats a, thats a pretty good note as well. Um We did that with like our, our terraform module right. There was like a community module but now its officially supported. So thats, thats the, you know, that can be the line, yes or no, whether you can use the thing uh for a lot of businesses. So I think thats a good one too."
spk_2,11.03731667,11.60733333,"How are we measuring excitement levels? 12 and three is there? I was, I was looking at um maybe MA U as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. Uh We probably may not have it for everything, but at least some of it wherever we have it is it, its probably something we can, we can use. Yeah, but we, of course, we need a benchmark level of what MA U we wanna call. 12 or three."
spk_0,11.625,12.65498333,"I, I think its a little, its a little bit of a judgment call like um you know, for example, Cormac was saying, uh like Epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time. Now, depending on how its asked for, maybe that means its exciting or its not, right? Um But uh usually when something gets a lot of upvotes or when theres a lot of demand for it, then I would, I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Um, certainly if something shipped and a lot of people are using it, the MA U, thats a, thats another good measure. I dont know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think its a bit of a, its a bit of an individual judgment column just like what is, what is your feeling based on, you know, could be anecdotal like you talk to customers and theyre like really hyper excited about this or, you know, maybe not, which is, which is OK. I think its OK. Um"
