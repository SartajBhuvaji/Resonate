spk_3,21.37631667,21.46815,"thats a pretty heavy, pretty heavy list just looking at it, you know, its pretty cool. Yeah, thats great."
spk_0,21.49898333,22.36516667,"Yeah, and this is something we dont do, which II I agree. Like we dont, we dont often stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins. Uh I was really, I dont, did yall, did anybody miss uh what do we call it assembly, the assembly? Um If you missed it, I recommend it. I laughed because like what assembly reminds me of is like when I was in like a young child in grade school, you, theyd have this big stack of like carpet, they were like squares of carpet and you go, like you go into the gym and you pull off a square of carpet and all the Children would sit on a square of carpet and that was like youd have an assembly so  that
 to put everyone in the gym or like convert the half cafeteria gym,"
spk_3,22.36781667,22.5275,"you know, take away the big barrier between it so that we can have more room and then take those carpets that have never been cleaned and just, you know, sit on them and itll be, itll be great."
spk_0,22.53383333,23.00565,"Aside, aside from the goofy name, I thought that, um, and of course we cant talk about any of it on youtube. But man, that was like a really awesome look back at like heres some wins and heres some exciting things that weve done. Um And so I think we just need to get better at this as a company. I think this exercise is an opportunity that um I think we do a little bit of that, but this is doing it more. So, uh Sonia, you have some questions here for elitists."
spk_2,23.04748333,24.15066667,"So, in the competitive sheet, I was, I mean, Ive already identified the features for CD configure as well as uh monitor. Uh getting it reviewed from PM. My guess was, or my understanding was that we wouldnt have the same set of competitors that they gonna compare to, but the right competitors for that particular stage, right? So for example, for uh for monitor, uh we may not have like a github or something like that, we would have monitor based competitors or was that the understanding because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage? I thought we were gonna be using those competitors to compare against. So I just wanted your, your input on whats because I saw uh some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there. Um So they may not be relevant, for example, Cloud be may not be relevant for monitor stage at all. Um So thats what I wanted to check with you."
spk_6,24.155,24.43048333,"Yeah, thats the case. I, I need to go back and look at the spreadsheet. I mean, if the competitor does not apply to that particular stage, they shouldnt be on that tab in the spreadsheet. So are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they dont apply? Yeah, I"
spk_3,24.4335,24.4425,think it was copy
spk_2,24.44565,24.82958333,"pasted. Each has the same. Yeah. So each sheet has uh has uh ad O Atlassian Guitar Jenkins, J Frog and cloud piece, right? So that may not be relevant for monitor for configure. It would be a different set of comp competitors that we need to include, which I think we already identified a while back. I think we identified top three competitors for every stage."
spk_6,24.83906667,25.1135,"We, thats when we tiered them, right? Tier one, tier two, tier three. So this where we are right now is were looking at just tier one competitors. Thats probably why I cut and paste them because those are all tier ones. So were just focusing on tier one right now. So if they dont apply to that stage, dont worry about it makes sense."
spk_3,25.12533333,25.17516667,"So, just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage."
spk_2,25.18366667,25.61381667,"Right. So we just use the tier one computers and if theyre not, if they dont, are not applicable, then we dont have to fill out anything for that.  Yeah,
 for now. But then well move to tier two and tier three, then well look at those and do we need to add a line item for get lab as well? Because I, I think thats the thing over here.  Yeah, we
 should add up. I think you asked me that"
spk_6,25.61581667,25.69115,"before. Right.  Or someone asked me,
 Im just looking at it, Brian"
spk_1,25.69866667,25.84216667,"asked because the way without it, youre basically putting all the things that were better at."
spk_6,25.85066667,25.89216667,"Yeah, for sure, for sure. Yeah."
spk_0,25.92933333,26.07465,"Ideally when we pick like the 10 to 15 features, those, some of those were like git lab only, some of those were like git lab didnt have,"
spk_3,26.09731667,26.17583333,"well, I thought it was supposed to be not, none of them should be get level only. Right. It should be all through the lens of."
spk_0,26.18731667,27.04081667,"Exactly. Yeah, it should be like market lens. So in an ideal world, most of them are like this is what Im shopping for this solution. Some, like some of them might be get level only. Some of them might be like competitor only so that its a, somebody would look at it and be like, this looks honest and trustworthy and like a, a accurate assessment of the market. And then, yeah, I think Sonia for this just to kind of reiterate for this one. Were only doing these five competitors. So well do the other ones in a later stage. And then uh for if, if the vendor builds like bills themselves as a platform, then we should specifically call out that they have zero. So github Bills itself as a platform, it sells itself that way. Um Same with as your Dev ops. Same with Jay Frog."
spk_6,27.04781667,27.09166667,"Well, they all do for tier one except Jenkins and Clovis"
spk_0,27.11231667,27.35181667,"Jenkins. Cloys does not. But what is it? You know, as your dep you have uh Atlassian and although Atlassian, we still need to figure something out there.  As a
 matter of fact, then I go back and add"
spk_6,27.35365,27.4775,"Atlassian because I based on conversation, I think we have to do it. I dont think we can leave them off. So then I, I dont, I have to look at this."
spk_2,27.48433333,27.5355,"It is Atlassian  is on that sheet.
 Ok."
spk_6,27.53648333,27.69781667,"Yeah, I went back and added them because based on discussion like my, my, I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner, but we cant do that. So,"
spk_0,27.71631667,27.963,"so, so yeah, so for, for those platform, you know, we should call out the fact that they dont have any monitoring. If they have like zero out of 15, we should call that out. Um Same with configure stuff for this, you know, any those kind of capabilities,"
spk_3,28.00565,28.23016667,"it be, it be, I think if we took that a step further, itd be good to even describe it in a way that doesnt just say our product stage and use like a value based description of what monitor and configure mean because otherwise were just, no, thats not gonna do any good for us."
spk_6,28.2385,28.48383333,"Have you guys seen the new infographic that the uh design team has come up with? Not yet. Oh You havent. No. Do we have a link to that quickly? William?  I dont
 know or we can throw it in the uh you can throw it in the um notes if you find it."
spk_0,28.49931667,28.55266667,Uh Lets see who can find it faster.
spk_3,28.56998333,28.61815,I guarantee you not with the amount of tabs I have open.
spk_6,28.63166667,28.76483333,"Oh my God. Thats why Im like, it probably wont be me. So I this is why I send everything to uh Google"
spk_0,28.77248333,28.97065,uh gmail because the search is so fast. So I literally have a folder where all of my get lab pings go and I can just search for infographic and I
spk_6,28.97333333,28.996,found it. I found it. I found it.
spk_0,29.00148333,29.0255,Who could look at first?
spk_6,29.053,29.36831667,"I found it. I found it. So this is the one. So this, theres two, this is the one for the single to comparison but then for the um but its gonna look the same but then heres the one for um I just put it in chat for you guys and heres the one for the platform players."
spk_0,29.39033333,30.2005,"So, so we made a, we made a couple of decisions along the way. So um one of the decisions was to just go with stages. Um It, it, it would have been like a whole another layer of OK, if we dont go with just the git lab stages, the 10 stages, what do, what do we use? um that has to be determined, reconciled all this kind of stuff like the, you know, we kinda, I dont know how long its been since we updated, those pages have like not been updated, but we kind of are just trying to move towards some sort towards some progress. So uh I concur that maybe configure and monitor is not as descriptive as it could be but the place where it will. So actually, Ill, Ill share one thing,"
spk_3,30.21083333,30.25483333,"it  just seems like the right time to do this,
 right?"
spk_4,30.25748333,30.3085,"Manage is, is even less descriptive than that."
spk_0,30.325,31.10381667,"So, so um the way this is the way this is getting built is off of a data model. So um in theory, these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same, right? Because like were, were separating like like presentation layer from data layer. Uh So thats, its not gonna be as hard to update in the future as it currently is where its a mess of spaghetti code and its like really, really difficult to update. And then the other component is then not in this iteration, we need to get something live. But in the next iteration youll click on verify and itll go down to the list of the 15 features and thats where you can describe what the heck of verify is  or what the heck I
 manage."
spk_3,31.11133333,31.32766667,"So we will have an opportunity because I was about to say youre gonna hate me for this. But like were, were being cyclical about the same problem we had there being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages. Thats a problem."
spk_6,31.33481667,31.73515,"That was one of the big things. Its like, OK, 1515 features. What, what is, what are they? Why do I care? You know? Yeah, that means to say that means nothing to me looking at this, this page. Um But quick question. No, were on top of it actually, if you read the thread I brought that up, but she said we cant do it like right now, which I understand but small thing, what do you guys think about the colors?"
spk_3,31.76181667,31.83816667,"Uh I dont know. I usually let the designers handle that stuff. They, they,"
spk_4,31.84315,31.97465,"I, I like, I, I like the fact that theres no red on there."
spk_6,31.98566667,32.02415,"Oh You like that? Thats what I was going  for you.
 Like"
spk_4,32.03081667,32.52983333,"its not, its not obviously negative. Uh So were saying because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because theres no, you know, these folks at 37% are in the red and theyre terrible. They just have less green or we would have less green. So its, its not, its not being worse, its being less good. And I think that, I, I think that lends itself to working with, you know, all the co opet situations were talking about, you know."
spk_0,32.54898333,32.83465,"Yeah, thats, thats the goal is we want, we want to generate a helpful asset for the industry. This is not just like marketing chill, this should be like a helpful page. Uh So its like, yeah, the goal is to have a comparison comparing DEV ops tool is not a, you know, this is all of our competitors and why were better."
spk_6,32.84233333,33.19883333,"Yeah. Um iiii I think from a competitive mindset and for me, Im like, lets go hard, lets put some red on there and thats just the way I think, right. So, but I brought it up and that for now were gonna stick with the green. They recommend that we stick with the green and uh see how it goes. But I dont know,  I was feeling the red and yellow too
 so it is easy on the eyes and um its, you know,"
spk_3,33.19898333,33.24816667,"theres something to be said for that. So, yeah,"
spk_0,33.25866667,34.96465,"uh cool. Well, were almost up on time but I did wanna share one thing that kind of came in like basically Friday, it was like late Thursday for me. So this uh this is another thing, a lot, a lot of these things, I dont have like a ton of context on. Um I just know like were just trying to up our game. So like, hey, lets move fast and do the best we can do. Um So this is a little bit of a messaging framework and then the assignment that was given to me was to, to fill in these boxes here. So, uh and then this was the fodder that I got. So there was these ones that said like from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent and a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. Honestly, I think this ones really like, really pithy and catchy. Uh I really like it. Um I really liked uh whats the other one that I like? But not everyone does um all in one for everyone. So I just uh I dont know, I like, I just think so theres something catchy about that. Um But I know that kind of catchy is not everyones cup of tea. All that to say is um the assignment here was that I took, it was to write a pithy, few words like punchy statement for each of these three things. Uh So I ended up with a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. I like that a lot. Um This one I went with end to end control over your software factory, not as pithy but or like not as catchy, but um I like it."
