So as Im talking, I see um its, its like lights flickering and more faces are appearing and um so excited to have so many of our Wappingers Central School District students joining us today. So I am gonna be hopping back and forth between our screens, but I did want to um just share a little bit about what this presentation is. Were going to go ahead and we are going to record this session. So, um Im going to go ahead and ask Louise as Im talking to get that started, that will allow any of our students who werent able to log in or if you wanna go back at a later date, just to review some of the information our speaker shared. I will be posting this information on our website. We also are gonna be um this will be live streamed on our youtube website. So thats another place that you can go to view this, this information. So again, this is called Our Career Zoom Health Series and this is session one of of, well, lets see, I think we have all the way through June scheduled. So we um are looking forward to doing that. So I dont have access to go to the next slide. But if Louise you want to go to the next slide for me, I will um just explain this partnership that developed organically. So we have two systems from the education realm. So obviously myself from Wapping Central school district is here and also Dutchess Community College will is on the call and worked collaboratively to bring this together. And in addition, we have the workforce Investment board and the Workforce Development Institute from New York State that the four of us work together. And we will be bringing into as youll see today, local and regional employers to bring some insights to you about the health care field. So Ill introduce everyone to you if we go to the next slide. So again, myself, Amy Watkins and then um Mary Jane Bertram, if you want to wave on the screen, everyone can see who you are. She is coming to us as the regional director from the Workforce Development Institute through New York State. Lorraine Koutz is from workforce development uh liaison and shes coming to us from the Duchess Community College. So, hello, Lorraine and obviously um the mastermind that brought and invited us to take part in this is Doctor Louise mclaughlin. And um she is the executive Director for Duchess County Workforce Investment Board So we were really thrilled to have these ladies with us working on this together and then our speakers for today, uh Doctor mclaughlin is gonna be talking to you first about an overview of the employment opportunities in our region. So thats always important to know what is out there um Before you pursue and put a lot of money into a career. If there are no jobs coming in that area, we also have Lane Belmonte coming to us to provide the employer perspective and she is the director of Human Resources from Premier Medical Group. So, hello, Laney and Karen Ingham is uh gonna be talking about education planning. So she has many, many hats that she wears at Dutchess Community College. Shes the department chair and assistant professor. She um is it leads the Department of Allied Health and Biological Sciences and also program chair, clinical laboratory technician and phlebotomy. So that is a mouthful. So thank you for joining us, Karen. So just a little bit of how, how we got here through this zoom. Um What the purpose of this is and I I sort of touched on this, but this is an opportunity for you our students to ask questions, to learn more about the health care profession, to see if it is a good fit for you before you do invest money um into an expensive college uh decision. And from here, I just wanted to go over this the next slide and just to give you a background that I um worked with three of our science teachers in the district to help put together, we developed a survey. We had over 310 of our students respond, which is really exciting. Um And they gave us some questions that they would like answered from the health care profession. And weve designed these series to give you information, but also allow you time like the last 15 minutes. Um And maybe a little bit longer if you have more questions for you to ask some questions at the end for our speakers. So just a little bit of housekeeping information are actually 1 to 2 and um each month. So we have these scheduled each month, theyre gonna be the third Wednesday, as I mentioned. Um And theyre gonna begin from 1230 to 115. We chose Wednesday because those are our virtual days and your instruction has has let out. So um we wanted to, to make this accessible as possible. And as many of you have already started to do your um the housekeeping pieces on the next screen are going to be um everyone is on mute as you can tell unless youre the speaker and that just cuts down on the extra background noise. So that is why everyone will be on mute. Um We want your camera to be on, this is your chance to make a connection with professionals. So you do wanna be um showing us your face and, and letting us know and getting used to that. This is uh right now, this is how we are connecting with, with professionals in our area because its the safest way to, to do that. Um When we cant be in person, you will have access to and I will be monitoring the chat once we get going. Um So you can ask questions and we will um be starting with our first poll because we wanna know a little bit more about who is on this call today. How many from, um, you know what grade youre in? Maybe youre a parent. So youll see pop up on your screen. Its gonna ask you what grade youre in or if youre a guidance counselor or a teacher, um, just go ahead and you can see live as the results start to pop in. So were pretty excited to see this. Weve got, um, almost, we have 66% of everybody voted. Um, and it does seem like, um, which makes sense that the, the, the, the highest number is coming from our 11th and 12th graders. Um, if at any point during this, um, you do have questions or afterwards you get a question and youre, youre wondering about, please dont hesitate. You see my emails come in. If you havent seen my emails, theyre probably in your junk folder. So definitely look for my name and, and try to find them, but without further ado, we looks like we have a great group of individuals here today, um uh that have joined us the majority being 11th and 12th graders, which is absolutely perfect. So were gonna kick it off. I am going to turn it over to Doctor mclaughlin and shes gonna give you an overview of what those employment opportunities look like in our region. So, thank you, Doctor mclaughlin."
1,spk_1,7.320833333333334,10.656333333333333,"Sorry, I put my face off screen and then I couldnt find the mute button. Um All right. So Im gonna just give you a little overview of sort of like what the numbers are in terms of employment um in general, in our five county regions. So not just Dutchess County, but the counties that touch our borders which are Ulster County, Orange, Putnam. And then um we dont really want to forget Westchester County because its just below Putnam South of us and theres a lot of job opportunities there. Um Were seeing um consistent job growth in health care over the past um five years. And if you look at the top industries in the region, they, the number one industry is health care uh along with social assistance and then government and retail, um the largest um healthcare employer shouldnt surprise you is the hospitals, but theres a lot of other employers throughout the county. So were gonna look at two kind of clusters. We, we kind of look at occupations, we can look at them individually, but we can also look them in groups and we call them like clusters. So theres 15 health care support occupations that I pulled some data for and theyre listed on the side. They started with home health aids, personal care aides and so on. And when youre looking to see, you know about um like what job opportunities are there, you kind of look to the job postings. So um this job supply right now is at about 48,000 650. And compensation here is um about 30 1000 a year, almost 32,000. And a lot of these are your entry level jobs. Um You know, where you might want to start in, in health care. And then if you look down, I also included the um the average wage nationally just so  that you would have that as sort
 of a point to, to look at. And then this data came from um Bureau of Labor Statistics and from um uh this organization called MC. Then when we look at um the skills that you need, the, we talk about hard skills and soft skills. So the hard skills are what you get from like a training provider from a school and you might end up with a certificate, um you know, with, with some of these. So their, their certificates in, you know, like home care. So when theres job postings, they all they list in the posting sort of what theyre looking for. So these are the things that these top jobs and the frequency that theyre looking for. So theyre looking for home care, caregiving people that can do meal planning and preparation of nutrition, stuff, personal care, um nursing, CPR  uh medical assistance,
 um daily activities, life activities, rehabilitation, and phlebotomy. And then we look at um next we go to, we look at soft skills.  So
 before I do  this, I want to
 ask you a question. So Im gonna launch a pulp and this question is for students only. So please select the answer that that best fits you. So I am currently working. Dont click that until you read a little bit more. Um Ive had a job in the past. Ive had participated in an internship and then theres some combination. So I currently have a job and Ive done an internship, Ive had a job in the past and Ive done an internship, Ive not had a job, but Im interested in working. Ive not had an internship, internship, but Im interested in internship and Ive not had a job or  internship but am interested in both or
 none of the above."
2,spk_2,10.6565,10.691,"If youre not sure what this is about,"
3,spk_1,10.695483333333334,12.733833333333333," thats OK too because well explain more as we go
 through the series, Ill give it another 20 seconds or so. OK. Five more seconds. OK. OK. So just sharing the results. So people can kind of see where everybodys at. OK. All right. So the reason I asked the question is if you look at the, the top common skills, OK, there are skills like communication, um compassion, customer service is a big one. Scheduling, clerical work, management, cleanliness, computer literacy, detail oriented. These are all skills that you can acquire in an internship or in really almost any part time job because these are the, the just the general skills that you need just to be able to work, go to work, be part of a team. Um, you know, report well with a supervisor, work well with management and so on. And then youll notice too that theres a valid drivers license. A lot of these, you know, they like you to drive. So if you, you know, if youre inclined to drive and you can have an opportunity to learn, um, it would be good to get a license if you can. Um, so where, where are these folks working? Where are the people in these healthcare support occupations, working within the industry? So if you go to um, a hospital youll see 12% of the workers there are, are in the healthcare support occupations, in a nursing care facility. Its more like 40%. Home health care services is the same around 37%. And then in offices of physicians its 18%. And in dentist its 33% and someone raised their hands. Mm.  Do you wanna unmute
 and do you have"
4,spk_3,12.7365,12.739,something.
5,spk_4,12.757333333333333,12.821," Yeah, go ahead and ask
 your question. Im not sure who FBI is, but go ahead."
6,spk_0,12.896816666666666,12.949483333333333," They might wanna think about it or
 they hit it by accident."
7,spk_4,12.9515,12.967316666666667,Ok. No problem.
8,spk_2,12.975166666666667,12.985983333333333,Ok. All right.
9,spk_1,13.000166666666667,13.052816666666667,"So  Im gonna do
 another quick"
10,spk_3,13.054666666666666,13.242833333333333,"call here. I hope. Sorry, Im not the best with, sorry. Oh my. What was that"
11,spk_2,13.319833333333333,13.341483333333333,"accurate?  Sorry
 about that."
12,spk_1,13.431983333333333,14.092,All right. So wed like to know if you want more information on these healthcare support occupations. So Im gonna launch the poll and then we have the list on the side of uh which occupations these are. So were just curious to see if you want more information. If youre not sure its OK too. OK. Ill give you five more seconds
13,spk_2,14.230983333333333,14.261983333333333,just to share the results. Ok.
14,spk_1,14.268833333333333,14.479983333333333,"So, you know, for the people that are, yes, well definitely be having people come in and talk about their experience working in these jobs. How they got trained with the day in the life is  um and for people that arent sure you may just wanna like
 tune in to see"
15,spk_3,14.481983333333334,14.531333333333333,"um whats,  whats what with
 that?"
16,spk_1,14.54765,14.894,"Um And then the other cluster were gonna look at are the 56 health care practitioners and technical occupations. Were looking at the same five county region and it goes anywhere from, you know, acupuncturists to, you know, folks working um um like veteran veterinarians and vet techs.  Um I think Amy, did you wanna Doctor Watkins? Did
 you want to speak to this a"
17,spk_3,14.894166666666667,14.9295,"little.  Absolutely.
 So again,"
18,spk_0,14.929666666666666,16.5079,"we dont expect that youre going to remember the list. Um And they can get confusing between the difference of the health care practitioners and the technical occupations and the support um health care positions that were in the previous slide. So youll, youll, Ill be posting these, like I said on the web page. But whats important is in the next slide. Uh Doctor mclaughlin is going to be talking about the difference in the salaries. And I think what youre gonna be hearing from the different speakers that we have throughout the series is that there isnt just one path that you can take to get to any of these, some of these can be foundational or you can use them um to build up for other positions. So you dont always have to just say Im going to school to be a doctor and do all the schooling and then become a doctor. You could start in any one of those support professions, get some experience, get some money and be going to school at the same time. So its always good to understand how those two two fields and, and how those salaries are weighing out and just to point to the internships as well, and we can continue to talk about this is that through the, through the school district, we offer work based learning and internships will um earn you credit. Um So one, you can take work based learning as an 11th grader and as 12th grader. So youll, you would earn two individual credits if you did it both years. And part of that could be through either a part time job in any one of these fields to help you get experience, which is great. Um, for when youre applying to colleges, you can have practical talking points, but also you"
19,spk_4,16.513233333333332,16.513916666666667,can
20,spk_1,16.533066666666667,16.541083333333333,stop it.
21,spk_0,16.568316666666668,16.84665,"Sorry. Um But also um you would have to  please make sure youre on mute. Ill take
 care of that. Um So you want to um make sure that you have access to work based learning just to learn a little bit more about the internships too. Ok, Ill turn it back over."
22,spk_3,16.86015,16.888483333333333,"Ok, great. Thank you."
23,spk_1,16.903983333333333,17.2683,"So if we um if we look at the the job supply, theres plenty of jobs over 50,000. Um the compensation, the um the median is 84,900. So almost 85,000, you have to remember too. We saw that wide range went from. How much money do you guys make?"
24,spk_0,17.326483333333332,17.407166666666665,"Well, well let doctor mclaughlin continue and then  well have time for questions
 afterwards."
25,spk_4,17.415,17.423666666666666,Thank you.
26,spk_1,17.434633333333334,19.78633333333333,"Um When were, when were looking at these numbers, we have to realize that um you know, the meeting is that number in the middle. If you look down at the bottom, youll see the averages, thats kind of everything added together and then averaged out. So it, theres a, probably a little bit of a bigger range here, but this gives you sort of an idea of what, what, you know, the salaries that, that could be made in these jobs. And then, you know, you may wanna know where, where you might work if you were a healthcare prac practitioner or you had one of those um tech jobs. So 50 in the hospital, 56% of the workers there will be um health care practice commissioners or like a tech person in a physicians office. Youre looking 43% of them nursing care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, thats 27%. Health and personal care stores is 37% and outpatient care centers is 40% and well, well look again here. Now youll see these hard skills are, you know, just so theres, theres a lot more involved in it. So theres more college in many of these, especially like nursing. Um you still have your basic life support, but now you get advanced life support. Um They like theyre looking for people that work in pediatrics with Children intensive care units, surgery, um emergency departments, acute care and medical surgical, nursing.  So those are all um skills that theyre looking
 for. And then, but whats so interesting is if you look at those, the soft skills, the common skills, they havent changed too much. You know, youre still looking at communication, youre looking at management, compassion, customer service, leadership these are all things that you learn at, at any job or any internship that youre doing. You may see that like management has moved up from um the previous slides where it was much lower. But now it, its still important. These are all skills that we need to do. Like planning um uh teaching problem solving.  This is all stuff
 that you, you can do in school with being organized and getting things in on time and, and all of that and  what I wanna
 do a quick poll here to see whos interested. Lets see. So if you would like more information on um this 56 clusters youre gonna put. Um Yes, if you dont, its no. And if youre not sure,"
27,spk_3,19.798666666666666,19.821666666666665,"then you could, you not sure."
28,spk_2,19.978,19.998166666666666,Give me 10 seconds.
29,spk_4,20.08031666666667,20.119666666666667,Seems like it of interest.
30,spk_2,20.12815,20.250666666666667,"Yes.  So
 thats great to see.  Share the
 results. So yes, there is a lot of interest there."
31,spk_3,20.260316666666668,20.304333333333332,Thats terrific. Great. Ok.
32,spk_4,20.313983333333333,20.363166666666668," Ok.
 So next, I would like to introduce you."
33,spk_0,20.363333333333333,20.916316666666667,"Our, our speaker from Premier Medical Group. This is Laney Belmonte. She is going to provide you with the employer perspective. Um As I said, shes the director of Human Resources. So thinking through what would a potential employer be looking for. So go ahead, Laney. Oh, she might be on mute. Think you might be on mute. Laney, I can meet you."
34,spk_4,20.920483333333333,20.928483333333332,There you go.
35,spk_3,20.933333333333334,20.947816666666668,Hows that?
36,spk_5,20.963166666666666,25.790983333333333,"Ok. So hello everyone. Im glad to see so many of you interested in health care. Um I work in human resources at Premier Medical Group. And uh one of the things we do in human resources is we hire people. Um So in that premiere, we have many different uh types of health care positions from those support positions that we were talking about um through to many of the technical positions. And one of the questions we might ask someone, you know, in an interview when theyre interviewing for a job is what led you to the career of being in health care. So I wanna talk to you about reasons you might think you want to be in health care. So one reason is you like working with people um or youre very compassionate and you, you like caring for people. Uh or you like science, youve enjoyed your science classes, you like uh the research involved, youre very analytical. Um you like to solve problems. Uh That might be another reason why job stability, there is a lot of job stability in health care. Um People are gonna continue to have Children and babies. Um Unfortunately, illnesses um are inevitable. Uh So theres, theres always gonna be a need for that personal care. Uh and health care workers, our population is growing. So um with, with the growing population, uh the demand for health care workers is increasing. So many health care positions are well paid um as the demand increases for healthcare workers typically. So do the, the, the salaries, health care careers are really diverse. You can, uh go into just general medicine. Uh, you can choose to go into a specialty. Uh, you know, here at premiere, we have many specialties, uh, you know, on the slide here it says foot, mouth, heart lungs. So a podiatrist is someone who specializes with feet. A cardiologist would specialize with, um, with issues of the heart. Uh Then theres also the administrative and management side. So we have medical billing people that are, they, theyre not clinical people who are doing hands on uh patient care, but theyre still in health care and they do uh billing or marketing or human resources. So theres, theres other admin of options in health care as well. So the the good news is theres lots of choices, there are many choices in the field of health care. Uh Some that require 1 to 2 years of advanced study after high school. Uh Some that might require uh four years of study or, or more and typically your, your income will increase the more education you have. So what can you guys do now to prepare for a career in health care? One is to finish high school, get your diploma. So thats, thats the first thing that you need to do. Um start doing some research, Google stuff. Look online, talk to your guidance counselors, talk to your parents, um perhaps talk to a healthcare professional whos doing the job, find out what their day to day is like, what they like, what they dislike. Um Those are all things that you can do to sort of explore this, this um this field of study and try to gain some experience. There might be some internships out there. Uh Oftentimes you can shadow a health care professional. Um Weve done that here. Ive had a couple of people come through here and uh just come in for a day and shadow someone to see what its like to work uh in a particular uh position. Um We also have hired people just for summer jobs, you know, so you get a flavor of, you know, what its like to even be in the healthcare environment. Uh Theres some volunteer opportunities. Uh Sometimes the nursing homes in the hospitals have volunteer hos uh opportunities. So, um so the good news is, its, its very diverse. Um Healthcare can be a really rewarding career. Um I have a couple of resources here that uh I just want you to take a quick look at because this, this could be part of your research. Um Louise, if you can, you click on that first link"
37,spk_4,25.904166666666665,25.957166666666666," and Laney while were
 waiting for Louise to bring up that page."
38,spk_0,25.957316666666667,26.092666666666666,"A question came in from Rebecca asking if theres um  um uh a minimum
 age that you need to be in order to do shadowing."
39,spk_5,26.129333333333335,26.292983333333332,"So, uh we typically have uh I would say you know, 17, probably 17 and above."
40,spk_3,26.314316666666667,26.333333333333332,"Great, great."
41,spk_5,26.353483333333333,26.806666666666665,"Uh So this is uh US news and its best health care jobs. These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before. Uh th those that typically require more education. So you can see well just for, you know, demonstration purposes. Um You can see, uh Im sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen. Is there a way to maybe I can just click it off. Thank you."
42,spk_3,26.810316666666665,26.85,"I have it.  I
 got it."
43,spk_5,26.96415,27.068316666666668,"So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes its a little"
44,spk_3,27.0875,27.2135,switch back and forth but were waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit? Um Some of our students arent familiar with that term.
45,spk_5,27.21848333333333,29.664483333333333,"Sure. So shadowing is where you, you might come in. Um, maybe youre gonna shadow another medical assistant for the day. Uh You might sit and talk with her and find out what shes doing whether shes doing something in the computer. Um, you know, in health care theres um, theres privacy issues with patients so there might be limited. Um, you know, it may be limited in terms of what you are able to know about a patient, but you can get a sense of, you know, follow them around, see what theyre doing, watch them take a blood pressure, um, you know, watch them, uh do vital signs, things of that nature. So the, uh, the resource thats there. There we go. So this is the one that has more technical jobs. Um, if we look down a little bit, you see the number one, these are, uh, the technical jobs that are ranked, you know, dentist is ranked number one, a physician assistant, number two. but what I wanna point out is one, itll describe a little bit about what that job is. If you click on the read more and then, uh, Louise, if you could just go down just a little bit and the o just up a little bit, there we go right there. Um, oh, I think it was on the first, the first page. Maybe go just that one. Ok. So you can see there on the right hand side, it will say the number of projected jobs in that field. So for example, physician assistant, it says theres 37,000 projected jobs. The median salary is 100 and 8000 and change. The education required is a masters degree. So this is a quick resource that you can use to look at different kinds of jobs. Get a sense of how much schooling youd have to do, how many jobs are out there in that field. And whats the salary. So, um, um, the second link and, and you, you can either pull that up or if its being difficult, Louise, I can just speak to it. Um, the other link thats on the first page."
46,spk_1,29.6855,29.813816666666668,"Can, can you see it? Did it change for you guys? If not, Ill stop sharing with you. You  have to stop in the beach here,
 let me"
47,spk_2,29.827333333333332,29.842816666666668,of the three share.
48,spk_5,29.913816666666666,30.720833333333335,"So uh this is another link from US news. Now this is more those the support positions uh that we were talking about. So these typically require less schooling. Um not all but some uh physical therapy assistant you see here, number three and again, on the right, you can see the projected number of jobs, the median salary and uh that this particular job requires an associates degree. So again, this is another um just another resource for you to use where you can quickly get a description of what the job is. See if there are lots of jobs or very little jobs available, what the median salaries are and what uh what education requirements there are for the position."
49,spk_3,30.801983333333332,30.814316666666667,Great. And uh
50,spk_4,30.819166666666668,31.039316666666668,"la would you mind?  Theres just two,
 two questions that came in um And your, your advice would be great.  Um A
 student was asking the best  way to
 um find out about an opportunity to shadow."
51,spk_0,31.039483333333333,31.1605,"Should they reach out directly to different health care? Should they go through their guidance counselor?  What would be the best way for them
 to do that?"
52,spk_3,31.177333333333333,31.301316666666665," Well, if the,
 if the school has any connections uh with different um health care"
53,spk_5,31.30315,31.619,"uh facilities, that might be the best way then they can advocate for those students. Um If in the absence of those, the student can uh try to contact someone at the organization. Um but it is probably better to have um  an
 advocate,"
54,spk_3,31.6295,33.140816666666666,"right? And I think like, um I can speak from the the school perspective, work based learning would be the a great way to do that. So for our district right now, Mrs Noy is in charge of the work based learning program. So if thats something um you can work with your guidance counselor to make sure you have work based learning on uh your schedule and then get in contact with Mrs Noy and, and she can uh work with you on different ways uh to reach out to the different agencies. And I know another student had asked about an internship with a um with a dietitian or nutritionist. And I would say that that would work the same way from our perspective, working at the schools. Although they probably could reach out to um a specific person that is in that field. Is that good for a second question that I it was kind of both of them. They were very Oh yeah. So is that, is that it for you, Miss Brown?  That is it
 for me? Unless anyone has any questions, Im happy to um answer them. Ok. And what we might do is well let um M Ingham go ahead and then we can have questions across the board for everyone because I wanna make that we do have time for, um, Miss Karen Ingham to speak from Dutchess Community College. So Im gonna turn it over to her and just keep putting your questions in the chat. Ill try to get to them, um, and, and bring them on to the end if we, if we have time. Go ahead, Karen.  All right. Well,
 thank you everybody. Its a pleasure to be here this afternoon."
55,spk_6,33.14833333333333,39.501333333333335,"Um Im here to talk a little bit about um what you might wanna think about doing when youre still in high school to prepare you for entry at the college level and uh not just community college. I mean, were an excellent choice. Um We have a low tuition and we do offer a variety of allied health programs you can see on the screen, the college offers offers programs that might take perhaps two semesters to complete. So those that are certificate programs are either a semester or two in length if youre a full time student. Um and then we have programs that are designed for you to go directly into the workforce. So if youre interested in perhaps um becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT, um if youre interested in, if you like working in the in health care, but not sure you wanna have direct patient care, you might think about something like clinical lab technician. Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license, once you complete your programs here at Dutchess, youre eligible to take the state licensing exams. And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh, the employment opportunities will basically, you know, hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse. If youre interested in transferring to a four year school, youre interested. I, I looked at the list people, a lot of people wanted to be doctors and physical therapists and nurses and, um, all those high level jobs. I mean, Dutchess is a great place to start. Even if youre thinking, um, you know, you know, for sure you wanna continue on. It really doesnt matter where you start, but it matters where you finish. So we are an excellent choice, especially during, um, online teaching. You know, when maybe you want to be the next Doctor Fauci, we have a public health program, um, that is articulated with Suny Albany, which means you can take the two years, uh, of courses, full time at Dutchess and all of your credits will transfer to University of Albany. So you can complete and get your bachelors degree in public health or you may choose to stay and get your masters in public health. Um, so there are a lot of opportunities we also have, um, what we call the Liberal Arts science pathway. So if you do wanna be that physical therapist, you wanna be that, um, dentist, you wanna be the doctor. You wanna be the occupational therapist. You can again, start at dutchess. Get two years of education, take all your sciences, your general education that you would normally take at a four year school as a freshman or a sophomore. And then those credits transfer, um, to your institutions. We have students who transfer all over the place. Um, they may, a lot of them go to Suny Binghamton. It has an excellent science reputation. Suny Stony Brook, Suny, New Paul University of Albany. And of course, Marist, uh Mount Saint Marys. Um, we have hi and the students who go through dutchess and transfer, they have a very high success rate. Once they transfer, our studies have shown that um our graduates typically uh do better at a four year institution than other transfer students as well as some of their original students that started there as a freshman. So right in your, in your neighborhood, you know, youve got Duchess and, and some of our tech jobs, you know, a semester, two years, four years, I mean, you can just keep building on as was already mentioned. And then before you know, it, um you can be out there doing what you hope to do while youre in high school. Im gonna tell you probably the same thing your mother has told you. Your father has told you, your guidance counselors have told you and your teachers have told you if you are interested in health care, you need to work hard at the sciences, your biology classes, if youre lucky enough and you, maybe youre doing a P biology, maybe with Miss Glancy or Missus mcfarland. I mean, youre gonna walk out and youre gonna do very well when you get to your, your, your institution of choice. Um, but, um, you know, continue with your chemistry, continue with your math. Um, you really want to make sure you have sharp skills because thats not gonna go away as you enter into, um, the courses at the college level. You also want to try to be mindful about your senior year. I know its senioritis kicks in but you want to m make sure that you are challenging yourself, pick courses. I mean, obviously any courses that you need to get your diploma, but if you have the opportunity to take those challenging courses, those A P courses, if thats a recommendation, we would highly recommend that you do that. You wanna show your, um, your college as you go through the admission process that, um, youre not afraid of hard course work. Um, they dont necessarily like to see a whole bunch of electives. Electives are great, right? Because how do you know what you wanna do? I know theres seventh graders, eighth graders, ninth graders, everyones here today. Very few people know for sure what they wanna do. Or even if they think they know what they wanna do, they might still end up changing their mind. And so by taking an elective, maybe a computer class or, or maybe a forensic science class, something outside of your normal, uh, course options. Who knows? That experience might, might help you really fine tune what you wanna study at your, at your institution. Um, and then if youre worried about your ranking, if youre taking an A P class, if you get a B plus in a college level biology class, OK. Put that in your essay. You know, I, I chose to challenge myself. Um I took college level calculus. I chose to challenge myself in my senior year or my junior year because I think its important to, you know, if Im capable, I should, I should try to do it and uh you know, get position yourself, you know, for that, for that uh transfer to the four year school. Um Anything else? Amy? I dont wanna, I, Im just looking at the time I wanna give opportunity for, for everyone to ask questions."
56,spk_3,39.501666666666665,39.543816666666665," Absolutely. We did have a few questions
 come in."
57,spk_4,39.54398333333334,39.631166666666665," Um
 Someone was asking about taking classes the best way  to take these classes
 while theyre in high school."
58,spk_0,39.63131666666666,39.68181666666667,"And I do think  you
 definitely wanna check with your counselor."
59,spk_4,39.681983333333335,39.73383333333334," You
 can look online and um see our course handbook."
60,spk_0,39.74398333333333,40.302483333333335,"I do understand what Miss Ingham was saying about electives. You wanna push yourself with your core content classes, but it is really great. Um particularly for the health sciences.  Our anatomy
 and physiology class is a great way to figure out if thats something that you, that you enjoy. Um I know over at Ketchum, Miss Gorman is teaching that class and, and shes on the call today. Um So you wanna, you wanna see these courses talking to your teachers too, specifically, your science teachers. Um They can make recommendations about specific um courses that they have  on here And I see Miss mcfarland
 is on here too."
61,spk_4,40.3055,40.58598333333333," Um
 So Im trying to just wanna see if I have um any hospital.  Um So
 I think what we can do if um you wanna raise your, your hand, we can um come off Mike"
62,spk_0,40.58866666666667,40.99565,"and um but I wanna make sure we dont have everybody coming off Mike um at once. Um so we can try that and if it gets a little bit, I see them, we will um go to the chat box but I know sometimes its easier just to, to raise your hand and Ill look for your hand coming up on the screen and try to call on you for questions. Um So ami you have a question if you wanna come off.  Um I can actually unmute you if you wanna ask
 your question."
63,spk_3,41.00516666666667,41.05765," Um Are
 there any like books that you read"
64,spk_2,41.05781666666667,41.13766666666667,"that really like impact you and influence you to  go into the medical
 field?"
65,spk_3,41.1475,41.16231666666667,Great question.
66,spk_4,41.24166666666667,41.31531666666667,"Uh Im gonna turn it over to one of our,  our professionals because Im not in the medical
 field,"
67,spk_6,41.34048333333333,42.101333333333336,"Ill answer that one. So, um I, um I always, I still love them. I like mystery novels. I like, you know, kind of like crime and mystery and then, um you know, all, all those series, you know, like, uh, I dont know, but I just like to solve mysteries. Um, kind of like its a puzzle and I tie that in with studying science where we always dont know the answer, but we do the research to try to get to that point. So I would think if youre interested in mystery novels, you might wanna think about, you know, um working in a lab, um working in health care because thats all about healthcare, trying to figure out whats going on with the physiology of our patients."
68,spk_4,42.131166666666665,42.217,Great other questions. Um Ill look to see if you raise your hand and
69,spk_0,42.233333333333334,42.25566666666667," get you to on
 mute."
70,spk_4,42.31366666666667,42.358666666666664," Dont be shy.
 Ok, Gavin, you have your hand up."
71,spk_0,42.3795,42.409666666666666,"You can, uh come off mute, but"
72,spk_2,42.422333333333334,42.562666666666665,"most volunteer programs were canceled because of the Coronavirus. Do you know what hospitals are doing?  Like if theyre doing anything
 virtual?"
73,spk_3,42.56881666666666,42.58533333333333,Thats a great question.
74,spk_5,42.61416666666667,43.25331666666667,"I dont know if, can you hear me? Yes. I dont know if the hospitals are doing anything virtual for volunteers. Um Im not sure what a volunteer would do. Uh, virtually. Um, you know, I know many of even the uh clinicals that the, uh, you know, nursing students and nurse practitioner students are virtual right now. Theyre not even doing in person for those. Um those, some of those are virtual, but Im not sure about uh for volunteers. I dont know of anything."
75,spk_4,43.29965,43.306,OK.
76,spk_0,43.318333333333335,43.924483333333335,"And I think, um to, to your point, Gavin and others are probably thinking of it. Its just really just checking in with um your counselors to hear if theyve heard anything they can reach out. You can you, you know, I always tell people if you have a question, youre more than welcome to email me. I may not know the answer, but I will work hard to try to find it out, uh find it for you. Um But ii, I do think that um particularly because of, of the pandemic, the health care sciences are really limiting right now having um people come in but perhaps that theyre working um  to develop some, some remote
 opportunities."
77,spk_5,43.93165,44.37715,"I, I just wanna, Im sorry, I just wanna say one thing. Um So what weve done, we do have a couple of college students that are doing temperature taking because because of the pandemic, weve had to station people in front of uh all of our different offices. So um that is one thing to potentially uh you know, look, look into, they might have temperature takers that sit in the front."
78,spk_3,44.38698333333333,44.483333333333334,"Right. Great. Good point.  Yeah, I think that some of these uh newer
 needs are developing as this"
79,spk_4,44.48565,44.593333333333334,"is new. So,  um, it
 certainly, uh, is something to keep checking in on. Um, and, and obviously"
80,spk_3,44.59766666666667,44.773983333333334,"theres certain things that you can do at certain ages. So, um, you, as you get, um, closer to graduation or post graduation, more opportunities will open up for you.  Um, I do
 know,"
81,spk_4,44.77415,44.838," I want to be sensitive
 to time and I do know we have one more poll question."
82,spk_3,44.838166666666666,45.184333333333335,"Um, I believe. Um, so I dont know if Doctor mclaughlin, if you wanna launch that, it, it speaking to, I know a few people have asked um what other professions were gonna be talking about? And um we are interested in that and we can go back through the chat to see if we have um captured those.  Do we have one more pool?
 Yes. OK, good."
83,spk_4,45.19283333333333,45.28581666666667," So, um these, these um are one of the, like
 I think it was the top 10"
84,spk_3,45.300666666666665,45.41981666666667,"professions that came from the survey that we um collected data from you.  And were just
 trying to get a sense on"
85,spk_4,45.425666666666665,45.50866666666667," um working with the
 professionals that we have access to um who we might"
86,spk_3,45.508833333333335,45.638,"be able to arrange for the future um Wednesday series that are coming up.  So,
 um I think the Zoom,"
87,spk_4,45.63816666666666,45.70315," the
 Zoom platform is gonna provide us a great number of opportunities,"
88,spk_3,45.703316666666666,46.03241666666667,"but its always good to know um where your interest lies.  Um And you may, you may be choosing
 one of these fields. And then after hearing someone else speak about their field that you had not considered. That might be very interesting to you too. So, thats the, the great part. Theres no, theres no bad one to join. So"
89,spk_0,46.043816666666665,46.1055,"well just give it a few more seconds.  And if some people are just reading
 through them,"
90,spk_4,46.11,46.156," we have about 60
 5% of you have voted"
91,spk_0,46.278483333333334,48.034166666666664,"a few more and then we can, um, end the pole at about 70% now. So obviously, doctors, um, doctor is still at the top of our list. Um But its great to see some of these other professions and I feel um that now that youll go back to this slide and see the different categories of the healthcare professions um for the support versus practitioners. Um Thatll be really helpful for you too to be thinking about. So I am thrilled again, you can see the results coming up on the pole. Um I think you can see them and um I just wanna thank again our speakers. So thank you again to La Laney Valmont. Thank you again to Karen Ingham and especially to um the fabulous women that I had the opportunity to work with to put this together. So, um a nice round of silent applause to Doctor mcla and to Laney Krauts and to Mary Jane Bertram for all of your efforts in meeting with us to uh talk through this series. Im so excited for what we have. Um Moving forward and um, thank you so much to our students for, for joining us today and again to Miss Gorman and to Miss mcfarland and Miss um, my,  Im
 gonna say her last name wrong. I dont want a Matt,  I
 think that here. Um, so thank you to the three of you for your help in getting this off the ground too. So, um, with that, we were gonna stop recording and um, wish the rest of you a wonderful afternoon and we will see you again in December."
92,spk_4,48.03731666666667,48.093666666666664,Um at I think it was the eight
93,spk_0,48.10648333333334,48.999316666666665,"18th. Let me look quick on my calendar. So make sure I get the third Wednesday of December and it is December 16th. So we will be back on December 16th. I will continue to send you emails again if you did not get my email today, make sure you look in your um spam or your trash or your junk folder to see if um uh it might be there. But um that is where I will be um sending the emails. I also do put these links in the calendar. So on any of our web pages, if you click on your calendar, building events, calendar, youll see the the month calendar. And um these will be on there called Career Zoom Healthcare Series. So, um again, dont hesitate to email any questions. Thank you for all the thank yous that are coming up through the chat. Um And we really look forward to um hosting more of these for you. Have a great."
