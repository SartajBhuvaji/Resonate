0.0,4.0,SPEAKER_06, I wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff of the meetings.
4.0,5.0,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, exactly!"
5.0,6.0,SPEAKER_01," Yeah, yeah!"
6.0,7.0,SPEAKER_01," No, no, no, no, no!"
7.0,8.0,SPEAKER_01, What was that?
8.0,9.0,SPEAKER_01, What was that?
9.0,10.0,SPEAKER_01, What was that?
10.0,11.0,SPEAKER_01, What was that?
11.0,12.0,SPEAKER_01, What was that?
12.0,13.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
13.0,14.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
14.0,15.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
15.0,16.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
16.0,19.0,SPEAKER_03, The one that I just go around and everyone says what they've been doing.
19.0,20.0,SPEAKER_03, Is it me without anything?
20.0,21.0,SPEAKER_01," No, no."
21.0,22.0,SPEAKER_01, What?
22.0,23.0,SPEAKER_06, What?
23.0,24.0,SPEAKER_06, What was that?
24.0,25.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
25.0,26.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
26.0,27.0,SPEAKER_06, Okay.
27.0,28.0,SPEAKER_06, Sounds like you've done something.
28.0,29.0,SPEAKER_06, What was that?
29.0,30.0,SPEAKER_06, Okay.
30.0,32.0,SPEAKER_03," Well, I've got a browser now."
32.0,33.0,SPEAKER_03," Which, whoops."
33.0,34.0,SPEAKER_03," Alright, now."
34.0,35.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
35.0,36.0,SPEAKER_03, What was that?
36.0,37.0,SPEAKER_01, Mm-hmm.
37.0,39.0,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I've got a blind spot."
39.0,40.0,SPEAKER_02," Oh, my God."
40.0,42.0,SPEAKER_02, Give it a sec.
42.0,43.0,SPEAKER_05, Give it a sec.
43.0,44.0,SPEAKER_05, Give it a sec.
44.0,45.0,SPEAKER_02, Give it a sec.
45.0,46.0,SPEAKER_02, Give it a sec.
46.0,47.0,SPEAKER_02, Give it a sec.
47.0,48.0,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
48.0,49.0,SPEAKER_03," So, yeah."
49.0,52.0,SPEAKER_03, We've got a browser we've got.
52.0,59.0,SPEAKER_03," A browser we've, which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics."
59.0,69.0,SPEAKER_03," And then when you go on the menu, you can select a summarization box, which pops up and an audio player."
69.0,72.0,SPEAKER_03, And I think the search works as well.
72.0,73.0,SPEAKER_03, So you pop up a search.
73.0,78.0,SPEAKER_03, And it loads up just the background when there's an empty.
78.0,84.0,SPEAKER_03," So, when you start, you have to either open, open a particular observation or do a search."
84.0,85.0,SPEAKER_03, And open it through that.
85.0,90.0,SPEAKER_03, That makes sense.
90.0,97.0,SPEAKER_03," The transcription box has got a summarised box, but not just doing it."
97.0,104.0,SPEAKER_03," Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up, we know where this speaker character"
104.0,115.0,SPEAKER_03," is. Either we could do that, you know, when does it pop up come either, we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box."
115.0,120.0,SPEAKER_03," Or we can put an extra button, extra for the buttons, and extra for the button."
120.0,128.0,SPEAKER_03," So that you actually in the transcription box, but so you click on the button and then it opens and it's via that speaker character."
128.0,138.0,SPEAKER_03," The problem is the left click is already used because it highlights that part speech or whatever that, what do you think?"
138.0,142.0,SPEAKER_03," The left click, the left click, the right click."
142.0,147.0,SPEAKER_03," So that, you can, I don't know what happened when you do it quite actually."
147.0,152.0,SPEAKER_03, I love you a bit and I don't know if you have a left click for one thing.
153.0,163.0,SPEAKER_03," I think, so yeah, when you're left click it, you can for example set the marker there so that the audio goes from there I think."
163.0,170.0,SPEAKER_03," So we can't put it on the left click, we could put it on the right click, we could, for example, have a little menu that pops up."
170.0,176.0,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, or you can't get that right click on it menu, you know, and you can click on the speaker characterisation box."
176.0,180.0,SPEAKER_05, What else can we have in there?
180.0,182.0,SPEAKER_03, That's a good point.
182.0,183.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
183.0,184.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
184.0,186.0,SPEAKER_05, I just have a right click on it.
186.0,190.0,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, I don't know about you but usually windows right click."
190.0,191.0,SPEAKER_03, Is it anything?
191.0,192.0,SPEAKER_03, Is it open to menu?
192.0,195.0,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, it's something you don't see."
195.0,198.0,SPEAKER_06, It's a bit weird for it to just drop the hidden stuff.
198.0,199.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
199.0,202.0,SPEAKER_06," To just sort of sort of, sort of, video throughout."
202.0,203.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
203.0,218.0,SPEAKER_02," Or just, you know, I'll just, I'll just, I guess in better, better mix a bit more sense because otherwise you know when we really know that, oh, what if I, right click that, what happens then?"
218.0,220.0,SPEAKER_02," Well, no, no, you still have the menu."
220.0,223.0,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, the menu's all about that."
223.0,225.0,SPEAKER_03," Well, oh yeah, it's more obvious isn't it?"
225.0,228.0,SPEAKER_03, It's more of a pretty physical button.
228.0,230.0,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, that's true, yeah."
230.0,234.0,SPEAKER_06," I'm just going to, I'm just going to want to add more things in a future."
234.0,236.0,SPEAKER_06, I don't know where it's going to be.
236.0,237.0,SPEAKER_06, Maybe.
237.0,239.0,SPEAKER_06, More flexible.
239.0,247.0,SPEAKER_05," Well, I guess in meeting browser 1.1, you can have a menu instead of a button."
247.0,248.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm glad.
248.0,250.0,SPEAKER_05," It's very, very."
250.0,261.0,SPEAKER_03," But actually what we could do is, in that menu as well, we could have an option that pops up a window with all the, all the meetings that that user has been in."
261.0,263.0,SPEAKER_03, Like a search for that user.
263.0,264.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
264.0,267.0,SPEAKER_03, Is that going to be useful or too much on?
267.0,268.0,SPEAKER_05, I guess so.
268.0,272.0,SPEAKER_05," So what did you, part of the, the menu that comes down is, says, give me what you're meeting."
272.0,273.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
273.0,279.0,SPEAKER_03," So when you right click on it, one, one option will be, give me all your meetings, characterizes speaker."
279.0,280.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
280.0,285.0,SPEAKER_03, Was that too much?
285.0,287.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I don't think it's good."
287.0,295.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, it's more like part of the browsing sort of thing more than this speaker."
295.0,296.0,SPEAKER_02," Is it, there's station?"
296.0,297.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
297.0,298.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
298.0,299.0,SPEAKER_02, It's pretty.
299.0,300.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
300.0,301.0,SPEAKER_02, Involved the speaker character.
301.0,302.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
302.0,303.0,SPEAKER_02, It's to be nice to have it in.
303.0,304.0,SPEAKER_06," Can I, can I, can I?"
304.0,305.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
305.0,306.0,SPEAKER_06, I need to tie that in with dialogue acts or something.
306.0,307.0,SPEAKER_06, It will only need speaker characterization.
307.0,308.0,SPEAKER_06," I didn't, I don't know."
308.0,311.0,SPEAKER_06, Just some way to sort of leverage that information.
311.0,312.0,SPEAKER_06, Like we have it.
312.0,313.0,SPEAKER_06, We're doing it.
313.0,316.0,SPEAKER_06," But what, how does it help the browsing or what can it give us?"
316.0,318.0,SPEAKER_06," What do you mean, those speaker characterization?"
318.0,319.0,SPEAKER_03," Oh, well."
319.0,320.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
320.0,322.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, I don't know about that."
322.0,325.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, the speaker characterization is a bit like you said."
325.0,327.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, it's like a nice thing."
327.0,328.0,SPEAKER_03, We don't know.
328.0,330.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm actually sure what the user wants to do it.
330.0,331.0,SPEAKER_03, But it's interesting.
331.0,332.0,SPEAKER_03, So why not give it to him?
332.0,333.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
333.0,334.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
334.0,335.0,SPEAKER_05, I think we should do it.
335.0,336.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
336.0,347.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like, well, if you get to speak, clarification that someone talks a lot in a certain topic."
347.0,351.0,SPEAKER_02," And then if you, I don't know, click on that topic, you get."
351.0,354.0,SPEAKER_02, I think that's in that topic.
354.0,355.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
355.0,357.0,SPEAKER_03, And that's still in other level further.
357.0,358.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, we're not eating that."
358.0,359.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
359.0,360.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
360.0,361.0,SPEAKER_03, So you pop up the speaker characterization yet.
361.0,364.0,SPEAKER_03, You have to first define what happens when you click on the user.
364.0,367.52,SPEAKER_05," With that speaker characterization, that's what we call the"
367.52,369.0,SPEAKER_03, other thing. Yeah.
369.0,372.0,SPEAKER_03, So should we try to do a right click when you're in it?
372.0,373.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
373.0,374.0,SPEAKER_02, All right.
374.0,376.0,SPEAKER_06," Well, is that just from the main?"
376.0,377.0,SPEAKER_06, No.
377.0,385.0,SPEAKER_06," Even if it's one, because I have a particular window, like if we want to try to get like it were on the users versus like a topic or something."
385.0,387.0,SPEAKER_06, Have a right to come from these various things.
387.0,388.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
388.0,389.0,SPEAKER_03, Wait.
389.0,390.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
390.0,391.0,SPEAKER_03, There's a second thing about the topics.
391.0,392.0,SPEAKER_03, The topic window.
392.0,398.0,SPEAKER_03," Somehow, click, be able to click on the topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that."
398.0,399.0,SPEAKER_03, Right.
399.0,400.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
400.0,402.0,SPEAKER_03, So we could do that in a similar way to it right click as well.
402.0,403.0,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
403.0,404.0,SPEAKER_03, So this does it for a little bit.
404.0,405.0,SPEAKER_05, It's a different role.
405.0,406.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
406.0,410.0,SPEAKER_05, Only the speaker.
410.0,421.0,SPEAKER_03, So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either searching and opening individual observations.
421.0,424.0,SPEAKER_03, And then we have the interlinking by right click.
424.0,425.0,SPEAKER_06, Okay.
425.0,426.0,SPEAKER_06, Right.
426.0,427.0,SPEAKER_06, Actually.
427.0,428.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
428.0,435.0,SPEAKER_06," Like another company like if we have it so set up that's, if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu, I mean that's kind of a typical kind of action."
435.0,436.0,SPEAKER_06, Double click.
436.0,440.0,SPEAKER_06, If you double click on a particular topic or something that goes to sort of like a default.
440.0,452.0,SPEAKER_06," Do you, so it will be like all the cases of that topic either, whatever you decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting and just short from particular instances of that topic."
452.0,459.0,SPEAKER_06," And just think to have the default there, so if somebody knows exactly what they want to do and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen."
459.0,461.0,SPEAKER_06, So the don't want to do that in such a different role.
461.0,463.0,SPEAKER_06, Right clicking and choosing the other one.
463.0,467.0,SPEAKER_03," I don't see that anything obvious that would be able to, that would be,"
467.0,469.0,SPEAKER_06, might come to us. Or quite with it.
469.0,470.0,SPEAKER_05, What was that?
470.0,471.0,SPEAKER_05, And then it got into that.
471.0,475.0,SPEAKER_06," And you mean, like we have to, the right click menu, you know, right click."
475.0,478.0,SPEAKER_06," But instead of like, how did you fall double click?"
478.0,480.0,SPEAKER_06," So there's a, there will be a choice."
480.0,483.0,SPEAKER_06," Because it has the most common, the exact use that we're doing."
483.0,486.0,SPEAKER_02," Like, show their speaker characters."
486.0,487.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
487.0,490.0,SPEAKER_03, But then there's a problem with a lot of one that's popping up again.
490.0,494.0,SPEAKER_03," And they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is, you know."
494.0,495.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
495.0,502.0,SPEAKER_02," But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?"
502.0,503.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
503.0,506.0,SPEAKER_02, So sometimes I don't like a stick.
506.0,507.0,SPEAKER_00, I'll go away.
507.0,509.0,SPEAKER_00, I'll come in closer.
509.0,510.0,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
510.0,511.0,SPEAKER_00," It's not, it's nothing."
511.0,512.0,SPEAKER_00, It's not.
512.0,514.0,SPEAKER_00, It's actually very touchpad.
514.0,515.0,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
515.0,517.0,SPEAKER_00, It's almost like a touchpad.
517.0,521.0,SPEAKER_03, I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.
521.0,522.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
522.0,524.0,SPEAKER_03, Because I think it won't do something.
524.0,525.0,SPEAKER_03, So it's not.
525.0,526.0,SPEAKER_01, It's better.
526.0,530.0,SPEAKER_03," I don't, I don't, I really don't see anything obvious that."
530.0,531.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
531.0,534.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know if you can think of something like that.
534.0,535.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
535.0,536.0,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
536.0,537.0,SPEAKER_03, So.
537.0,538.0,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
538.0,539.0,SPEAKER_03, So.
539.0,540.0,SPEAKER_02, So.
540.0,541.0,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
541.0,542.0,SPEAKER_02, So.
542.0,543.0,SPEAKER_02, So.
543.0,544.0,SPEAKER_02, So.
544.0,545.0,SPEAKER_02, Please.
545.0,546.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
546.0,547.0,SPEAKER_02, What you're clicking on.
547.0,548.0,SPEAKER_02," Oh, sorry."
548.0,549.0,SPEAKER_03," Um, yeah."
549.0,550.0,SPEAKER_03, Another thing.
550.0,551.0,SPEAKER_03, Single audio files.
551.0,552.0,SPEAKER_03, Do we want to use them?
552.0,553.0,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
553.0,554.0,SPEAKER_03, We don't know yet.
554.0,555.0,SPEAKER_03, Do we?
555.0,558.0,SPEAKER_03, Do we want to use them?
558.0,559.0,SPEAKER_05, We don't know yet.
559.0,560.0,SPEAKER_05, Do we?
560.0,561.0,SPEAKER_05, Do you mean single channel?
561.0,562.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
562.0,563.0,SPEAKER_03, Single channel.
563.0,564.0,SPEAKER_03, Then single channel files.
564.0,565.0,SPEAKER_03, Do we want them?
565.0,566.0,SPEAKER_05," I mean, probably not."
566.0,569.0,SPEAKER_05," But I mean, we might need them for the splinses."
569.0,570.0,SPEAKER_05, If we can go to our video.
570.0,571.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
571.0,572.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
572.0,573.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
573.0,574.0,SPEAKER_03, But you might use them at the moment.
574.0,575.0,SPEAKER_03, To work with them.
575.0,578.0,SPEAKER_03," But do we want to integrate them so that when you browse, we can."
578.0,581.0,SPEAKER_05," We might want to be able to say, oh, just give me what that person's saying."
581.0,582.0,SPEAKER_03, Do you though?
582.0,583.0,SPEAKER_03, No.
583.0,584.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm going to say it's a few at least until I say it.
584.0,585.0,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
585.0,586.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
586.0,590.0,SPEAKER_05," So, I'm going to say, you can't hear it probably or something, so I'm going to talk about something like something like that."
590.0,593.0,SPEAKER_05," Which is saying that for now, I'm going to put it in the wrong."
593.0,594.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
594.0,595.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
595.0,596.0,SPEAKER_01, Cool.
596.0,597.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
597.0,598.0,SPEAKER_05," Otherwise, it will decrease."
598.0,601.0,SPEAKER_05," It will increase in that 30 minute, I'm not going to."
601.0,602.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
602.0,603.0,SPEAKER_05, Before.
603.0,604.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
604.0,605.0,SPEAKER_02, Before.
605.0,606.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
606.0,612.0,SPEAKER_03," And yeah, what do people think in general about the Windows Cluttering?"
612.0,613.0,SPEAKER_03, That you can mention.
613.0,619.0,SPEAKER_06, Do you think we call it a need that don't tap the full flexibility we need to have.
619.0,620.0,SPEAKER_06, That's why I've got this all.
620.0,625.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, I remember very much I want to have everything customizable."
625.0,631.0,SPEAKER_06," Well, the thing is typically though, if someone could have five windows open at the same time, probably not."
631.0,632.0,SPEAKER_03, Probably not.
632.0,635.0,SPEAKER_03, Two or three of whatever they're looking at with dialogues.
635.0,636.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
636.0,637.0,SPEAKER_03," But yeah, it depends."
637.0,639.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere."
639.0,646.0,SPEAKER_03," And in the summary, for example, a stippable, you open in the window, you read through it, you might click up, you know, close it yet straight away."
646.0,647.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
647.0,648.0,SPEAKER_02, But it'd be good to have it.
648.0,649.0,SPEAKER_02, I think it's fun.
649.0,650.0,SPEAKER_02, But it could be.
650.0,658.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time."
658.0,663.0,SPEAKER_02, So maybe you can just like choose the same window for transcription and memory.
663.0,665.0,SPEAKER_06, It's like have a town there.
665.0,666.0,SPEAKER_02, There's no question.
666.0,667.0,SPEAKER_02," Oh, yeah."
667.0,668.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
668.0,669.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
669.0,670.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
670.0,671.0,SPEAKER_03, It's a nice.
671.0,672.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
672.0,673.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
673.0,674.0,SPEAKER_03, That's right.
674.0,675.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm not sure.
675.0,676.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
676.0,677.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
677.0,678.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
678.0,679.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
679.0,680.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
680.0,681.0,SPEAKER_03, Probably can.
681.0,682.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm sure.
682.0,683.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm sure you could do anything.
683.0,685.0,SPEAKER_05," If you read, you know, you're doing, you know, I don't know."
685.0,688.0,SPEAKER_05," It's a bit of a cripple which I always have been knowing to, okay."
688.0,689.0,SPEAKER_05, Maybe sometimes.
689.0,692.0,SPEAKER_05, It's a bit of a couple.
692.0,693.0,SPEAKER_03, I can have a look.
693.0,694.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
694.0,695.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
695.0,696.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
696.0,697.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
697.0,698.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
698.0,701.0,SPEAKER_02, That might be nice to have a content.
701.0,702.0,SPEAKER_02, So this is a window.
702.0,703.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
703.0,704.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
704.0,705.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
705.0,706.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
706.0,707.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
707.0,709.0,SPEAKER_06, We're even just have buttons on it.
709.0,710.0,SPEAKER_06, Totally buttons or something on the toolbar.
710.0,711.0,SPEAKER_06, That window.
711.0,712.0,SPEAKER_06, Hmm.
712.0,713.0,SPEAKER_06, That's something.
713.0,714.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
714.0,715.0,SPEAKER_06, I don't know.
715.0,716.0,SPEAKER_06, It doesn't have to be a town.
716.0,717.0,SPEAKER_01," No, no."
717.0,718.0,SPEAKER_06, It could be like transcription.
718.0,719.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
719.0,720.0,SPEAKER_06, Like transcription.
720.0,721.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
721.0,722.0,SPEAKER_02, Like two photos.
722.0,723.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
723.0,724.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
724.0,725.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
725.0,726.0,SPEAKER_05, For a check.
726.0,727.0,SPEAKER_05, We're happy to have a window.
727.0,728.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
728.0,729.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
729.0,730.0,SPEAKER_05, We're a geese member of windows.
730.0,731.0,SPEAKER_05," No, you wouldn't."
731.0,733.0,SPEAKER_05, You could have a photo shop has a lot of windows.
733.0,736.0,SPEAKER_05," If you have a geese photo shop, it's got loads and you're always good forever going."
736.0,737.0,SPEAKER_05, I'll get out of the way.
737.0,738.0,SPEAKER_05, There's always stuff in the way.
738.0,739.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
739.0,742.0,SPEAKER_03," But I mean, people get used to it."
742.0,747.0,SPEAKER_03," When you use a windows or a new-neck square, you have a window's open."
747.0,748.0,SPEAKER_03, You do manage them.
748.0,749.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
749.0,750.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
750.0,751.0,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
751.0,752.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
752.0,753.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
753.0,756.0,SPEAKER_05," Unless Katie, I thought I suppose you can minimize them and stuff like that."
756.0,757.0,SPEAKER_05," Yeah, you can minimize them."
757.0,758.0,SPEAKER_03," Katie, that."
758.0,759.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
759.0,760.0,SPEAKER_05, Okay.
760.0,761.0,SPEAKER_05, That was a lot of it.
761.0,762.0,SPEAKER_05, Of course you can.
762.0,767.0,SPEAKER_06," Like a lot of these can be, like once we get the disfloots out, then we can, you know, transcript with the, the disfloots."
767.0,768.0,SPEAKER_06," Yeah, that's true."
768.0,769.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
769.0,770.0,SPEAKER_06, That's true.
770.0,775.0,SPEAKER_06, They're all in sort of using the same window and so we don't have to be the same window.
775.0,776.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
776.0,779.0,SPEAKER_06," Usually, just because the tools are."
779.0,780.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
780.0,781.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
781.0,782.0,SPEAKER_03, That was a plan for the dysphonuses anyway.
782.0,783.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
783.0,784.0,SPEAKER_02," So, yeah."
784.0,787.0,SPEAKER_03, Do you want to do that with some reason?
787.0,790.0,SPEAKER_03, Put the summaries in the same window.
790.0,791.0,SPEAKER_03, Me tree.
791.0,792.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
792.0,794.0,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't know."
794.0,795.0,SPEAKER_02, With transcripts.
795.0,798.0,SPEAKER_02, It sounds reasonable to have like transcripts.
798.0,803.0,SPEAKER_02," Maybe three else or an instance, like full meeting, meeting without dyspluses and summaries."
803.0,804.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
804.0,805.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
805.0,806.0,SPEAKER_03, Do you want to do that?
806.0,807.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
807.0,808.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
808.0,813.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
813.0,815.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
815.0,816.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
816.0,817.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
817.0,823.0,SPEAKER_03," And for the late prototype, he's a bit of a little more kind of prototype could be pretty used."
823.0,824.0,SPEAKER_06, I need a few more.
824.0,830.0,SPEAKER_03," Because I'm, I'm just, you know, I go to the lab and I'm like, what am I going to change today?"
830.0,832.0,SPEAKER_03," You know, any kind of just, it just develops."
832.0,835.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm not aiming for anything.
835.0,837.0,SPEAKER_03, Do we want to answer something?
837.0,838.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
838.0,843.0,SPEAKER_03," Um, I'm pretty much getting there anyway."
843.0,844.0,SPEAKER_03, Do you know?
844.0,846.0,SPEAKER_03, It's not going to be a lot more.
846.0,847.0,SPEAKER_03, I guess it is.
847.0,855.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, just to try and, I mean, for us to be able to do something, then we can include the third thing."
855.0,856.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
856.0,857.0,SPEAKER_05," So, yeah."
857.0,860.0,SPEAKER_05, Something just slightly more than just that on some sort of important moment.
860.0,861.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
861.0,863.0,SPEAKER_02," Just so silly, educational work."
863.0,864.0,SPEAKER_02," So, we can do it."
864.0,865.0,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
865.0,866.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
866.0,867.0,SPEAKER_05, Definitely.
867.0,871.0,SPEAKER_02," Um, so I guess that's what I'm doing."
871.0,875.0,SPEAKER_05, I think that's kind of what he meant as well as we're taking it sort of started.
875.0,876.0,SPEAKER_05, That's what I'm just thinking.
876.0,879.0,SPEAKER_05," Well, that's kind of, I'm trying to talk with the gerry."
879.0,880.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
880.0,887.0,SPEAKER_02," Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but my name is written at the time."
887.0,888.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
888.0,889.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
889.0,890.0,SPEAKER_00, I know.
890.0,891.0,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
891.0,892.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
892.0,900.0,SPEAKER_06," Actually, just the code accessible, like the GUI stuff that you've done, like can we just like copy and like play this stuff, like your directory."
900.0,903.0,SPEAKER_06," Um, like if we're going to just try and take a look or something."
903.0,904.0,SPEAKER_06, I don't know if you can access some of the people's.
904.0,913.0,SPEAKER_04," You can make it well-rated, but if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable and wait, and I'll be directly to get it in."
913.0,914.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
914.0,915.0,SPEAKER_03, Sure.
915.0,917.0,SPEAKER_03," I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show that."
917.0,918.0,SPEAKER_05, I think I default there aren't.
918.0,920.0,SPEAKER_05," No, they're not well-rated, but they're not well-rated."
920.0,921.0,SPEAKER_05, They're not well-rated.
921.0,922.0,SPEAKER_05, They're not well-rated.
922.0,923.0,SPEAKER_05, They're only default.
923.0,924.0,SPEAKER_05, Only you can read them.
924.0,925.0,SPEAKER_05," Oh, right."
925.0,926.0,SPEAKER_05," You can see them, but you can read them."
926.0,928.0,SPEAKER_03," I'll make that read them, will they?"
928.0,929.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
929.0,932.0,SPEAKER_03, So the directory is my number.
932.0,933.0,SPEAKER_03, Wait for just email.
933.0,934.0,SPEAKER_06, It's my number.
934.0,935.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
935.0,936.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
936.0,937.0,SPEAKER_03," Well, this is not difficult."
937.0,938.0,SPEAKER_03, Right.
938.0,939.0,SPEAKER_03, Once you're on the email.
939.0,940.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
940.0,941.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
941.0,942.0,SPEAKER_03, You're on the email.
942.0,943.0,SPEAKER_03, No.
943.0,944.0,SPEAKER_03," Oh, for."
944.0,945.0,SPEAKER_03, You can.
945.0,946.0,SPEAKER_03," Oh, for."
946.0,947.0,SPEAKER_03," For five, five, five."
947.0,948.0,SPEAKER_03," For six, oh."
948.0,949.0,SPEAKER_03," For five, five, six, oh."
949.0,950.0,SPEAKER_03," For five, five, six, oh."
950.0,951.0,SPEAKER_03, And then it's.
951.0,959.0,SPEAKER_03, And then there's a folder and an LSSD.
959.0,962.0,SPEAKER_03, And it's called the end browser.
962.0,963.0,SPEAKER_05, The end browser.
963.0,964.0,SPEAKER_05, Yes.
964.0,965.0,SPEAKER_05, What would it be?
965.0,966.0,SPEAKER_05, End browser.
966.0,967.0,SPEAKER_05, Yes.
967.0,968.0,SPEAKER_05, And it's probably not.
968.0,969.0,SPEAKER_05," I mean, you never have to look in my directory."
969.0,970.0,SPEAKER_05, It's just pure chaos.
970.0,971.0,SPEAKER_05, No.
971.0,973.0,SPEAKER_03," No, I was dreaming of it."
974.0,976.0,SPEAKER_03, I've got a lot of starting the other phone.
976.0,977.0,SPEAKER_05, The one is two.
977.0,978.0,SPEAKER_05, It's quite awesome.
978.0,979.0,SPEAKER_05, So.
979.0,980.0,SPEAKER_05, That's everyone.
980.0,981.0,SPEAKER_05, That's everyone.
986.0,987.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
987.0,988.0,SPEAKER_03, So that's me doing someone else more.
988.0,989.0,SPEAKER_03, I told that I saw.
992.0,993.0,SPEAKER_00, The final jumper one.
993.0,996.0,SPEAKER_02, Can you tell me what I'm in this bit.
996.0,997.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
997.0,998.0,SPEAKER_02, I told you.
998.0,1000.0,SPEAKER_02, Oh.
1000.0,1001.0,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1001.0,1004.0,SPEAKER_02, I basically started browsing a bit.
1004.0,1009.0,SPEAKER_02," Just like, I see if there's anything out there to use."
1009.0,1012.0,SPEAKER_02, What one do you need?
1012.0,1013.0,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
1013.0,1014.0,SPEAKER_02, I'll just search it.
1014.0,1015.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1015.0,1016.0,SPEAKER_02, I'll just search it.
1016.0,1017.0,SPEAKER_02, It's not the next.
1017.0,1018.0,SPEAKER_02, I'll just search it.
1018.0,1019.0,SPEAKER_02, It's the next.
1019.0,1020.0,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1020.0,1021.0,SPEAKER_02, Found a tutorial.
1021.0,1022.0,SPEAKER_02, It inverted the search.
1022.0,1023.0,SPEAKER_02, You can see the back.
1023.0,1024.0,SPEAKER_02, So you can go on and just use that code.
1024.0,1026.0,SPEAKER_06, Like that is behind the question.
1026.0,1027.0,SPEAKER_06, You asked them really.
1027.0,1028.0,SPEAKER_06, Yes.
1028.0,1029.0,SPEAKER_02, You can go on.
1029.0,1030.0,SPEAKER_06, We're using code and stuff.
1030.0,1031.0,SPEAKER_06, Just like perfect.
1031.0,1032.0,SPEAKER_02, And that's a much safer.
1032.0,1033.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1033.0,1035.0,SPEAKER_02," Well, I don't know if it's usable."
1035.0,1036.0,SPEAKER_02, I could have a little bit.
1036.0,1040.0,SPEAKER_02," But I found some code for like, like, fake tutorial about it."
1040.0,1041.0,SPEAKER_02," Oh, cool."
1041.0,1045.0,SPEAKER_04," So even if it doesn't, like, you can, do you go to be put on, make an app properly."
1045.0,1046.0,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
1046.0,1047.0,SPEAKER_04, We'll probably stop doing some other file method.
1047.0,1048.0,SPEAKER_04," Well, I'm a creature."
1048.0,1049.0,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
1049.0,1050.0,SPEAKER_04, Let's see.
1050.0,1051.0,SPEAKER_04, Let's see.
1051.0,1052.0,SPEAKER_04, Let's see.
1052.0,1053.0,SPEAKER_04, Is it okay?
1053.0,1054.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1054.0,1055.0,SPEAKER_03, That's how it is.
1055.0,1056.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1056.0,1057.0,SPEAKER_03, So you think you should be too difficult?
1057.0,1059.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't know.
1059.0,1060.0,SPEAKER_03, I was a bit worried about one.
1060.0,1065.0,SPEAKER_02," Well, I mean, talk about this with a file."
1065.0,1066.0,SPEAKER_02, There's no one else.
1066.0,1075.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, how much do you actually need to do, like, like, extracting things from the XML files and stuff, to be able to do the indexing?"
1075.0,1076.0,SPEAKER_02," Oh, I see."
1076.0,1077.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1077.0,1079.0,SPEAKER_03, I have to convert it to some sort of format.
1079.0,1082.0,SPEAKER_03, I've been trying to write something to read the XML file.
1082.0,1083.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1083.0,1086.0,SPEAKER_05, I've been trying to write something to read the XML file.
1086.0,1088.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm going to get rid of it.
1088.0,1092.0,SPEAKER_05," And I can get rid of it, but I'm happy to jump and put me anywhere else."
1092.0,1094.0,SPEAKER_05, So I can't wait for the screen.
1094.0,1095.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm not sure what it is.
1095.0,1100.0,SPEAKER_05, I haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in Java.
1100.0,1101.0,SPEAKER_05, I'll get to the player.
1101.0,1102.0,SPEAKER_05," Well, are you ready in Java?"
1102.0,1103.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1103.0,1104.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1104.0,1105.0,SPEAKER_05, Okay.
1105.0,1106.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1106.0,1107.0,SPEAKER_01," I mean,"
1107.0,1115.0,SPEAKER_03," I mean, you should have, you have a look at the browser code then, because, you know, they already extract, for example, transcripts."
1115.0,1116.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1116.0,1117.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm sure I do.
1117.0,1118.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1118.0,1119.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1119.0,1120.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1120.0,1121.0,SPEAKER_05," Oh, yeah."
1121.0,1122.0,SPEAKER_05, I don't know.
1122.0,1127.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm sure I'm making a maze of it.
1127.0,1129.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm not making a maze of it.
1129.0,1130.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1130.0,1147.0,SPEAKER_02," I guess, I mean, it was a good point you had that, like, collaborating with how things, I mean, if you are a historian, yeah, yeah."
1147.0,1148.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1148.0,1149.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1149.0,1150.0,SPEAKER_05, I'm sitting here.
1150.0,1151.0,SPEAKER_05, We can.
1151.0,1152.0,SPEAKER_05, Should share as much as possible.
1152.0,1153.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1153.0,1154.0,SPEAKER_02, My worries.
1154.0,1155.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1155.0,1156.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1156.0,1157.0,SPEAKER_02," Should we,"
1157.0,1160.0,SPEAKER_02," I don't know, meet up and see what we could get."
1160.0,1165.0,SPEAKER_02," I mean, I don't know, see what you've done, and see what we need."
1165.0,1166.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1166.0,1167.0,SPEAKER_02, When we need maybe.
1167.0,1168.0,SPEAKER_02, Next week.
1168.0,1169.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1169.0,1170.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1170.0,1172.0,SPEAKER_05," So you're still actually out of that, I didn't do this week."
1172.0,1174.0,SPEAKER_05," This week, this week's been married."
1174.0,1175.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1175.0,1176.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1176.0,1178.0,SPEAKER_03, This week was only two days old.
1178.0,1180.0,SPEAKER_03," Well, it was nice."
1180.0,1186.0,SPEAKER_05," The week as it is, rather than the proper week, did I make sure it's getting a little bit about it?"
1186.0,1188.0,SPEAKER_06," Well, that's quite a good idea."
1188.0,1189.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1189.0,1190.0,SPEAKER_05, That's right.
1190.0,1191.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1191.0,1194.0,SPEAKER_05," And then I had to do an IRP whatever it was, that was making."
1194.0,1196.0,SPEAKER_05, Which is only a place where I'm just about to go to our page.
1196.0,1197.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1197.0,1198.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1198.0,1200.0,SPEAKER_01," Oh, that's good."
1200.0,1203.0,SPEAKER_05," It was, I'm just, I don't think about it for a bit."
1203.0,1204.0,SPEAKER_05, I think that's it.
1204.0,1205.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1205.0,1206.0,SPEAKER_05, I don't think so.
1206.0,1207.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1207.0,1208.0,SPEAKER_05, That's common.
1208.0,1209.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1209.0,1210.0,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1210.0,1211.0,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1211.0,1212.0,SPEAKER_01," So,"
1212.0,1217.0,SPEAKER_06," yeah, I was thinking that we'd generally probably start attacking this seriously."
1217.0,1223.0,SPEAKER_06," I'm just going to, you know, hopefully have something by next week that we can sort of try and to create into the group."
1223.0,1224.0,SPEAKER_06, Mm-hmm.
1224.0,1225.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1225.0,1226.0,SPEAKER_06," Well,"
1226.0,1232.0,SPEAKER_03," the browser's on, you know, or as, I don't know, it was there when I took it."
1232.0,1243.0,SPEAKER_03," Um, it uses the, um, the NXT search to get the data out of the files, which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works."
1243.0,1244.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't quite understand.
1244.0,1247.0,SPEAKER_05," So, when it, when it,"
1247.0,1254.0,SPEAKER_03," to get the data, for example, to get the summarization data, you have to search for, I think the ID is on something."
1254.0,1255.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1255.0,1257.0,SPEAKER_05, I have a privilege.
1257.0,1258.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1258.0,1260.0,SPEAKER_05," So, that's the same way."
1260.0,1263.0,SPEAKER_05," It's got, the, the ID is pretty."
1263.0,1268.0,SPEAKER_03," So, they don't, they don't say, look, that might fall there."
1268.0,1269.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1269.0,1270.0,SPEAKER_03," So,"
1270.0,1272.0,SPEAKER_06," it's such, everything."
1272.0,1276.0,SPEAKER_06," I think it's pretty, so, I think it's, it wasn't the most efficient."
1276.0,1279.0,SPEAKER_06, It does really have quite crap.
1279.0,1280.0,SPEAKER_03, I don't think that.
1280.0,1288.0,SPEAKER_02," But, but, what, what, I said, like, we know where we have to, what's behind it."
1288.0,1291.0,SPEAKER_02," So, no, this is not the actual search."
1291.0,1298.0,SPEAKER_03," This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript, for example, to find the transcript for a certain meeting."
1298.0,1307.0,SPEAKER_03," It does, does, let's see, search for, the string, I don't know, transcript, or, the next,"
1307.0,1313.0,SPEAKER_05," for, and it, like, it just has an open variable, transcript, whatever,"
1313.0,1315.0,SPEAKER_03," find everything that's got there, and the mode."
1315.0,1320.0,SPEAKER_03," So, it's such a query language, but it's like a dollar, a text,"
1320.0,1325.0,SPEAKER_05," yeah, yeah, because that's the, because of it, yeah,"
1325.0,1339.0,SPEAKER_03," and then, yeah, because every, every year, all of these, these files, I've got an ID and all of the transcript files, I've got the string, I don't know what it is, where it's on text or something."
1339.0,1342.0,SPEAKER_03," So, just searches for those files."
1342.0,1343.0,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1343.0,1345.0,SPEAKER_03, What are you doing?
1345.0,1351.0,SPEAKER_02," What are you like, is there a open thingy or, or, what are you doing?"
1351.0,1357.0,SPEAKER_02," Like, what did you do to, like, how do you figure out that the computer's, the next thing search,"
1357.0,1359.0,SPEAKER_03," like, and is it?"
1359.0,1367.0,SPEAKER_03," Well, it's in the code, just like, you know, you define a search object, and then search, that's the string."
1367.0,1371.0,SPEAKER_03," I had to figure out how to, how to do the same thing, but somewhere that's how I, how to see,"
1371.0,1376.0,SPEAKER_03," how to understand, how to do the transcript, how they did that, how they did the transcript, to do something like that."
1376.0,1377.0,SPEAKER_03," So,"
1377.0,1379.0,SPEAKER_05," did you have to write it in the way that they write it, so we did?"
1379.0,1380.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1380.0,1383.0,SPEAKER_03, Just search for a specific string.
1383.0,1385.0,SPEAKER_05, What?
1385.0,1391.0,SPEAKER_03," So, you could just, you know, you could use that when, if you want to, take the data out."
1391.0,1393.0,SPEAKER_05," Just the data out, just thinking that you,"
1393.0,1408.0,SPEAKER_03," yeah. If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want, or whatever you want to do, then just say, you know, I can't explain."
1408.0,1409.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1409.0,1411.0,SPEAKER_05," If you're going to take the dual code,"
1411.0,1425.0,SPEAKER_03," oh yeah. Actually, in the mode, it's got a load of rubbish, because the, the, the browser that I used from, you know, that they gave us, I had a lot of extra stuff in, and have data thrown out, just throughout all the functions that have, just had data."
1425.0,1426.0,SPEAKER_00, Just had data.
1426.0,1427.0,SPEAKER_00, Just put that in.
1427.0,1428.0,SPEAKER_00, Just put that in.
1428.0,1429.0,SPEAKER_03, Just put that in.
1429.0,1432.0,SPEAKER_03," So, they're all in there, still."
1432.0,1436.0,SPEAKER_03," So, I'm going to be sure to check out my data."
1436.0,1440.0,SPEAKER_05," Like, coming, coming to get out one minute at a time, probably get to work."
1440.0,1441.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1441.0,1442.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1442.0,1443.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1443.0,1444.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1444.0,1445.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1445.0,1446.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1446.0,1447.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1447.0,1448.0,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1448.0,1449.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1449.0,1450.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1450.0,1451.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1451.0,1452.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1452.0,1453.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1453.0,1454.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1454.0,1455.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1455.0,1456.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1456.0,1457.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1457.0,1458.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1458.0,1459.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1459.0,1460.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1460.0,1461.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1461.0,1462.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1462.0,1463.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1463.0,1464.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1464.0,1465.0,SPEAKER_03, I'm still at the bottom of the mountain.
1465.0,1466.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1466.0,1467.0,SPEAKER_06, How many hours is this?
1467.0,1468.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1468.0,1469.0,SPEAKER_03, I think they should have that much to do.
1469.0,1470.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1470.0,1473.0,SPEAKER_03," Well, should you play the input to explore any other?"
1473.0,1474.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1474.0,1475.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1475.0,1476.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1476.0,1480.0,SPEAKER_05," How, how should you ask your, uh, quantify crazy?"
1480.0,1481.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1481.0,1482.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1482.0,1483.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1483.0,1485.0,SPEAKER_03, I can't remember what I'm supposed to do by the way.
1485.0,1488.0,SPEAKER_03," Am I supposed to do the, some realization thing about?"
1488.0,1489.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1489.0,1490.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1490.0,1491.0,SPEAKER_02, Hey.
1491.0,1494.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1494.0,1495.0,SPEAKER_03, Right.
1495.0,1497.0,SPEAKER_06," Uh, what's doing?"
1497.0,1498.0,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1498.0,1499.0,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1499.0,1500.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1500.0,1501.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1501.0,1502.0,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1502.0,1504.0,SPEAKER_01," Well, I'll do that."
1504.0,1505.0,SPEAKER_01, This can be changed.
1505.0,1506.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1506.0,1507.0,SPEAKER_06, I don't know.
1507.0,1508.0,SPEAKER_03, It doesn't matter.
1508.0,1511.0,SPEAKER_06," If you want to, just play around with too much of time."
1511.0,1512.0,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1512.0,1513.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1513.0,1514.0,SPEAKER_03, That should make sure you did it.
1514.0,1515.0,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1515.0,1516.0,SPEAKER_04, Yeah.
1516.0,1518.0,SPEAKER_05, That's a lot of courses you should take.
1518.0,1519.0,SPEAKER_05, We'll take it to a little bit in there.
1519.0,1520.0,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
1520.0,1527.92,SPEAKER_03, And I'm doing communications of which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.
1527.92,1529.96,SPEAKER_03, That's in two weeks.
1529.96,1531.96,SPEAKER_06, Was that an informatics?
1531.96,1532.96,SPEAKER_06, Of course.
1532.96,1533.96,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1533.96,1535.96,SPEAKER_03, I would like to teach you all.
1535.96,1537.96,SPEAKER_03," My includes is running 10, okay."
1537.96,1538.96,SPEAKER_06, Okay.
1538.96,1547.36,SPEAKER_03," And then I'm doing power programming languages and systems, which we had one exercise as well."
1547.36,1554.36,SPEAKER_03, I'm not doing any backhand things.
1554.36,1555.36,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1555.36,1559.36,SPEAKER_03, I'm doing a little bit.
1559.36,1560.36,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
1560.36,1561.36,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1561.36,1564.36,SPEAKER_06, I'm happy when this week is over.
1564.36,1567.36,SPEAKER_02, I'm happy to have your way to this course.
1567.36,1568.36,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1568.36,1571.36,SPEAKER_06, I'm excited about it though.
1571.36,1572.36,SPEAKER_06, I hope.
1572.36,1576.24,SPEAKER_06," It helps me meet, to discuss."
1576.24,1581.24,SPEAKER_06, Did you want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?
1581.24,1584.4599999999998,SPEAKER_06," Well, I don't know."
1584.46,1594.8600000000001,SPEAKER_06, probably get some work done over the weekend so I know after DMLG or something we just have a little quicker to update and just be happy I like it.
1594.8600000000001,1600.06,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, I'm sorry. So what are you planning to do over the weekend then?"
1600.06,1604.7,SPEAKER_03, Search. You're gonna do the search.
1604.7,1608.7,SPEAKER_06, That's why. Yeah. It can be out of it.
1608.7,1614.7,SPEAKER_06, It'll be still limited version of the next query.
1614.7,1620.7,SPEAKER_06, It won't be a whole thing. Like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do.
1620.7,1624.7,SPEAKER_06," Actually, it just down on accident."
1624.7,1632.7,SPEAKER_06, I'm sorry.
1632.7,1638.7,SPEAKER_06, Don't go straight away.
1638.7,1644.7,SPEAKER_03, I think we need to ask ourselves some milestones because otherwise.
1644.7,1648.7,SPEAKER_03," Yeah. Yeah, it's a little more."
1648.7,1650.7,SPEAKER_06," It's a little more. Yeah, it's a little more."
1650.7,1652.7,SPEAKER_06, Like you're saying.
1652.7,1656.7,SPEAKER_06," Actually, do we want to set a date for interim prototype?"
1656.7,1660.7,SPEAKER_06," Specifically, a date."
1660.7,1664.7,SPEAKER_03, Do you decide? I'm not looking at what you want to put.
1664.7,1670.7,SPEAKER_02, The progress report is two or three.
1670.7,1674.7,SPEAKER_02, Third. All.
1674.7,1678.7,SPEAKER_05, Third. So that's two weeks.
1678.7,1682.7,SPEAKER_03," Well, how about we get it done by then?"
1682.7,1688.7,SPEAKER_03," Yes, yeah. Then we can write about it in the interim report."
1688.7,1692.7,SPEAKER_05, We've got some to show.
1692.7,1702.7,SPEAKER_02, Just a little bit of light.
1702.7,1704.7,SPEAKER_03, I see.
1704.7,1710.7,SPEAKER_03, I want the search interface.
1710.7,1716.7,SPEAKER_03, Maybe you should decide pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for.
1716.7,1720.7,SPEAKER_03," And then if you want, you can give up to me now."
1720.7,1724.7,SPEAKER_03, I'll build you nice in a few dick boxes and drop down on your ears.
1724.7,1728.7,SPEAKER_02, What's the number like what do you have now?
1728.7,1730.7,SPEAKER_02, No.
1730.7,1732.7,SPEAKER_03, That doesn't exist.
1732.7,1736.7,SPEAKER_03, That's completely compasted.
1736.7,1738.7,SPEAKER_03, That's not exist.
1738.7,1740.7,SPEAKER_03, That's not anything.
1740.7,1742.7,SPEAKER_00, That's one of the best things.
1742.7,1750.7,SPEAKER_03," There's actually all these things that are mixed from, you know, all these drop down menus and tick boxes are mixed from Google."
1750.7,1754.7,SPEAKER_03, This screenshot of Google.
1754.7,1756.7,SPEAKER_03, Oh.
1756.7,1760.7,SPEAKER_01, That's just so funny.
1760.7,1762.7,SPEAKER_03, Maybe you can exist.
1762.7,1764.7,SPEAKER_03, It's going to be a little difficult.
1764.7,1765.7,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1765.7,1767.7,SPEAKER_03," I mean, I was going to."
1767.7,1772.7,SPEAKER_03," But, you know, the whole drop down menus and stuff, what we want to search for is not quite agreed."
1772.7,1776.7,SPEAKER_03," I mean, if I've agreed on what would be able to search for."
1776.7,1777.7,SPEAKER_03," No, it's not really."
1777.7,1778.7,SPEAKER_04, It's not.
1778.7,1779.7,SPEAKER_06, It's not.
1779.7,1780.7,SPEAKER_03, It's sort of a border we can.
1780.7,1781.7,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1781.7,1784.7,SPEAKER_03, Do you want to just get together and think about different types of search we could possibly do.
1784.7,1791.7,SPEAKER_03," And then we could discuss that next meeting, which options we really want to include."
1791.7,1794.7,SPEAKER_03, It will be a little different.
1794.7,1797.7,SPEAKER_03, Certainly.
1797.7,1804.7,SPEAKER_02, We can go back and actually support the programming and do anything in the studio.
1804.7,1805.7,SPEAKER_02," Um, and we can..."
1805.7,1810.7,SPEAKER_02, If you can get to Marker.
1810.7,1813.7,SPEAKER_02, Go to contentious.
1813.7,1814.7,SPEAKER_02, Pull it up.
1814.7,1815.7,SPEAKER_02, We can't do something.
1815.7,1816.7,SPEAKER_02, I can really do anything.
1816.7,1820.5,SPEAKER_06, No public copy tools.
1820.5,1840.34,SPEAKER_06, you don't just get a quick look over and just can take it so it's you so it'll see I'm more than to put you over the class path so that sort of thing like just say okay well here's everything's basically also done and just yeah yeah just show you how it's okay that's what it's possible in the morning
1840.34,1847.06,SPEAKER_03, well for some eye details
1847.06,1867.06,SPEAKER_06, well things you know something like that could happen anytime because like my schedule is like a class right class right class yeah I just want to take it out yeah I know exactly yeah yeah yeah that's why I'm thinking so something like that and then if I have a class I can not off yeah pick a tire okay
1867.06,1871.06,SPEAKER_03, Monday
1871.06,1881.22,SPEAKER_06, any time not instantly not at noon or two or four no in between those three
1881.22,1884.58,SPEAKER_03, three talk actually
1884.58,1918.64,SPEAKER_05, yeah that's not option two okay three skid but we have like the computer in here can't it get an with the
1918.64,1919.64,SPEAKER_03, I'm not fan-like yet.
1919.64,1922.64,SPEAKER_05," How can you take that? Well, if you find me, I'll show you it."
1922.64,1923.64,SPEAKER_05, I'll let it all in there.
1923.64,1924.64,SPEAKER_05, I'm not going to take it.
1924.64,1925.64,SPEAKER_05, I can't make it now afterwards.
1925.64,1926.64,SPEAKER_05," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
1926.64,1928.64,SPEAKER_05," You did need to have a key for it, though."
1928.64,1929.64,SPEAKER_04, That's the thing.
1929.64,1931.64,SPEAKER_04," It's got a lot of little, but just for going on."
1931.64,1937.64,SPEAKER_06," Yeah, somebody actually was asking Steve, but they're whether we can get in there, whether he was going to get us access into it."
1937.64,1938.64,SPEAKER_02, Into work.
1938.64,1939.64,SPEAKER_02, The key people.
1939.64,1940.64,SPEAKER_02, How good.
1940.64,1942.64,SPEAKER_05," It's only got this crap, so I think about four or five defeats."
1942.64,1947.64,SPEAKER_05," It would do quite a bit of a large job, because Ken also, it's not very opening with people."
1947.64,1949.64,SPEAKER_05, It's very important to me.
1949.64,1950.64,SPEAKER_05, It's very important to me.
1950.64,1951.64,SPEAKER_05, And it's a fight scope here.
1951.64,1953.64,SPEAKER_05, With the code on it.
1953.64,1955.64,SPEAKER_05, It's good with it.
1955.64,1956.64,SPEAKER_05, It's good with it.
1956.64,1959.64,SPEAKER_06," Well, I just want to add your assignment."
1959.64,1961.64,SPEAKER_06, I'm going to add your assignment.
1961.64,1963.64,SPEAKER_00, You've got to have my computer.
1963.64,1965.64,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, well, the comment's not thinking."
1965.64,1967.64,SPEAKER_03, So what time did we say?
1967.64,1970.64,SPEAKER_03," I just think it's better to do it afterwards, and we have all the time."
1970.64,1971.64,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, that's right."
1971.64,1972.64,SPEAKER_03, I've got to do that.
1972.64,1973.64,SPEAKER_03, I'm off and on.
1973.64,1974.64,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1974.64,1977.64,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1977.64,1980.64,SPEAKER_06, As long as Ken Elchie doesn't go late.
1980.64,1982.64,SPEAKER_06, Hopefully it's not that man's out.
1982.64,1983.64,SPEAKER_05," Wait, let's go."
1983.64,1987.64,SPEAKER_03," Actually, it's not even confirmed yet."
1987.64,1988.64,SPEAKER_03, What?
1988.64,1989.64,SPEAKER_03, Oh.
1989.64,1991.64,SPEAKER_03, She doesn't even know what she's talking about.
1991.64,1992.64,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
1992.64,1994.64,SPEAKER_03, Maybe it doesn't happen at all.
1994.64,1995.64,SPEAKER_03," It's really, it should be."
1995.64,1996.64,SPEAKER_02, It should be.
1996.64,1997.64,SPEAKER_02, It should be.
1997.64,1998.64,SPEAKER_02, Is it really?
1998.64,1999.64,SPEAKER_02," Well, it should be."
1999.64,2000.64,SPEAKER_01," Well, it should be."
2000.64,2002.64,SPEAKER_02," It's really, it's really, it's really."
2002.64,2003.64,SPEAKER_02," It's really, it's really."
2003.64,2005.64,SPEAKER_02, I don't think we have a rainy week then.
2005.64,2007.64,SPEAKER_02, We have one class at least one week.
2007.64,2008.64,SPEAKER_02, That's a pretty special.
2008.64,2009.64,SPEAKER_02, We don't have any pictures.
2009.64,2012.64,SPEAKER_02, I think I don't like all other classes.
2012.64,2016.64,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, I don't think there was an official one last semester."
2016.64,2018.64,SPEAKER_03," So I think it was just a back home, isn't it?"
2018.64,2019.64,SPEAKER_06, Something like that.
2019.64,2020.64,SPEAKER_05, I think one of the couple classes did.
2020.64,2022.64,SPEAKER_05, Something else he did and something else he did.
2022.64,2023.64,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
2023.64,2024.64,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
2024.64,2027.64,SPEAKER_02," I think the other one was really, I think the other one was just head."
2027.64,2028.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2028.64,2030.64,SPEAKER_02," Oh, the one goes up to the professor."
2030.64,2033.64,SPEAKER_06, I don't feel like it.
2033.64,2034.64,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
2034.64,2039.64,SPEAKER_06, I think they all probably have one to make up for missing classes.
2039.64,2040.64,SPEAKER_06, What?
2040.64,2041.64,SPEAKER_06, Do you have a problem?
2041.64,2042.64,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
2042.64,2043.64,SPEAKER_01, We will come up with you.
2043.64,2044.64,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
2044.64,2045.64,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
2045.64,2046.64,SPEAKER_01, We'll have to click.
2046.64,2047.64,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
2047.64,2048.6400000000003,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
2048.6400000000003,2049.6400000000003,SPEAKER_03," That's me, Mummy."
2049.6400000000003,2050.6400000000003,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
2050.6400000000003,2053.6400000000003,SPEAKER_02," Um, I guess."
2053.6400000000003,2054.6400000000003,SPEAKER_02, Let's see.
2054.6400000000003,2055.6400000000003,SPEAKER_02, What's there?
2055.6400000000003,2056.6400000000003,SPEAKER_02, Anything else?
2056.6400000000003,2057.6400000000003,SPEAKER_02, Do you have one up?
2057.64,2060.64,SPEAKER_02," Like, I care this was sure I took out."
2060.64,2061.64,SPEAKER_05," Oh, wait, trust you."
2061.64,2062.64,SPEAKER_05, Yeah.
2062.64,2063.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2063.64,2065.64,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if there was something.
2065.64,2073.64,SPEAKER_02, I think it basically said the same things as college.
2073.64,2075.64,SPEAKER_02, I could do it.
2075.64,2077.64,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
2077.64,2078.64,SPEAKER_06, Maybe that.
2078.64,2079.64,SPEAKER_06, Okay.
2079.64,2088.64,SPEAKER_06," Uh, I think it's a really wonderful windows from a single app."
2088.64,2089.64,SPEAKER_02, Let's see.
2089.64,2090.64,SPEAKER_06, Go there.
2090.64,2093.64,SPEAKER_06, But most we'll probably want to go with the false.
2093.64,2094.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2094.64,2095.64,SPEAKER_02," Oh, that was amazing."
2095.64,2096.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2096.64,2098.64,SPEAKER_06, I think it's the basic size of the science.
2098.64,2099.64,SPEAKER_06, Yeah.
2099.64,2105.64,SPEAKER_06, Which I can just do a comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topics of orientation.
2105.64,2106.64,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
2106.64,2107.64,SPEAKER_00, That's great.
2107.64,2108.64,SPEAKER_00, What are you doing?
2108.64,2109.64,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
2109.64,2110.64,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
2110.64,2112.64,SPEAKER_02, Now we have seven percent of the paper.
2112.64,2113.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2113.64,2114.64,SPEAKER_02, That's good.
2114.64,2115.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2115.64,2116.64,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
2116.64,2119.64,SPEAKER_02," So we need to be okay both, right?"
2119.64,2121.64,SPEAKER_02, If you're okay with having a...
2121.64,2122.64,SPEAKER_02, Same thing.
2122.64,2123.64,SPEAKER_02, What is this?
2123.64,2124.64,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
2124.64,2127.64,SPEAKER_05, Just signing off.
2127.64,2128.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
2128.64,2129.64,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
2129.64,2130.64,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
2130.64,2132.64,SPEAKER_03, She was trying to stop her.
2132.64,2133.64,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
2133.64,2135.64,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
2135.64,2140.64,SPEAKER_02, Are you sure it's still here?
2140.64,2141.64,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
2141.64,2142.64,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
