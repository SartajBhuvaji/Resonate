00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.350
Yeah, the universal one.

1
00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:04.869
So presumably that might be an idea too.

2
00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:05.670
But,

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.070
but

4
00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.430
25 you need a lot of

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.109
neat features.

6
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.930
Yeah.

7
00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.420
Yeah. Uh cause I mean, what €25 that's about,

8
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.340
I don't know, £15 or so

9
00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.440
and that's quite a lot for remote control.

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.420
Um Well,

11
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.030
my first thought would be

12
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.350
most remote controls. A re grey or black, as you said, they come with a TV.

13
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.130
So it's normally just your basic grey and black remote controls as functions. So

14
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.549
maybe we could think about colour

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.520
make that might make it a bit

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.669
different from the rest a t least.

17
00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.630
Um

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.419
And as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick. So

19
00:00:45.669 --> 00:00:47.139
um I thought maybe

20
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.490
something like.
