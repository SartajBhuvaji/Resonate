WEBVTT

0
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.549
I can record

1
00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:05.039
and we don't have a ton

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.539
of items to get to,

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.520
uh

4
00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.539
and I might be able to do one that might be fun

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.899
if we have a little bit of time.

6
00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:16.090
Um

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.110
So corporate events,

8
00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:19.549
uh

9
00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.180
they,

10
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:22.409
I

11
00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:24.870
think I saw a little, I put this in,

12
00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:28.379
in slack and I saw a little bit of uh kind of noise around it,

13
00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:29.590
which was good.

14
00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.110
Um

15
00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.950
You know, the,

16
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.509
the nutshell here is as we've kind of restructured and

17
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.509
tried different things. Um

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.669
The event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be.

19
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.419
Uh So

20
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:51.169
the current tactic that we're going with is go to market team

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.759
signs up and kind of s

22
00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:55.540
sponsors that event.

23
00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.310
So you support as a PM M, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, et

24
00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:01.790
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

25
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.659
Uh I don't

26
00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:05.889
see anyone in the uh

27
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.879
maybe there are comments in the issue. I don't see the,

28
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.419
the header updated yet.

29
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.910
I thought we had in Slack sort of farmed each one of them out.

30
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.180
That's

31
00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.319
so I guess that the next, so it looks like

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.980
Thai

33
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.379
put in

34
00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:27.480
some folks it looks like

35
00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:29.269
this looks good.

36
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.989
So that,

37
00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.650
let's see, need support from GTM teams.

38
00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:38.389
So I guess the ask would be,

39
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.970
um,

40
00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:45.430
to work with your GTM team. So, so did, let me ask it,

41
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.099
I saw some slack, I think in our Slack.

42
00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:50.650
But did, did you all, uh,

43
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.110
were you all able to connect with like your GTM teams,

44
00:01:56.839 --> 00:02:00.459
uh, on Slack only and on the issue actually?

45
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.610
Yeah, same, not in, not in real time, but, you know, source feedback.

46
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.540
I got one person to respond so far.

47
00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:09.380
So it may end up Cindy being you and I just picking the

48
00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.809
one that we want to do and then they can back and set up

49
00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.990
um

50
00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.220
If we don't get any more feedback.

51
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.860
Yeah. Do you all um

52
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.039
Does anybody have like a, a regular sink still?

53
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.690
Are those all been canceled or is there

54
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.830
in

55
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.229
case you still have a regular

56
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.589
sick?

57
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.630
-- Yeah, we're on like a two week
-- cadence.

58
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.389
Ok.

59
00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.690
Yeah, GS has been canceled um after the enablement.

60
00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:43.169
Cool. So

61
00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.460
I'm just trying to catch up with the thread.

62
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.149
Um

63
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.320
So it looks like maybe a platform on re invent

64
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.550
C

65
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.460
I CD on Google next and

66
00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:58.399
gets on coupon.

67
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.899
Does that sound right?

68
00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.039
That's where we were last I heard.

69
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.029
Cool. So then I think,

70
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.750
um

71
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.830
I think we can, we can help the Corp events team.

72
00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:15.309
They do, they do a lot of like a cat herding and,

73
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.750
you know, keep on tracking people down.

74
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.630
So I think if, if this team can take the mission to,

75
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.630
like, try to help

76
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.509
track that down. So, if you, you know,

77
00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:30.940
get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, like we're,

78
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.619
we're signing up for a coupon,

79
00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.919
you know, can you comment on the issue that yes, I can commit to this, et

80
00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.759
cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

81
00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.979
you know.

82
00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:40.699
Um

83
00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.350
So that just so that they can get that,

84
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.679
that event support, but that looks good. And I appreciate

85
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.410
uh thanks for the link too, Sonia on the roles

86
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.949
ah

87
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.119
product announcements.

88
00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.770
So I appreciate you Brian for adding this. I uh I probably should have added it, but

89
00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:08.240
I had two questions about that. 11 is over. What time frame are we looking at?

90
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.320
So,

91
00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.089
uh

92
00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:15.559
so in theory, this is this could be the same as the

93
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.260
Gab 14 launch where we're saying basically since 13.0

94
00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:23.440
what has, you know, what kind of big improvements have we made?

95
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.190
Um

96
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.260
Candidly, this is always a little bit tough and I'm and I'm,

97
00:04:31.019 --> 00:04:34.209
I am not totally sure of all of the

98
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.109
kind of the interplay here,

99
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.230
but I think

100
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.190
I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment

101
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.410
is OK, we have commit coming up.

102
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.440
We have some amount of like we have a stage of,

103
00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:49.179
you know, a

104
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.769
metaphorical stage

105
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.779
to say something to the world and we'll get some

106
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.529
amount of press attention because we're having an event,

107
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.450
right?

108
00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:59.619
What kind of announcements do we make?

109
00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:00.529
Um

110
00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:02.000
at git lab, it's really,

111
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.489
really tough to make product announcements because

112
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.769
our entire roadmap is completely public,

113
00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:08.140
yada yada yada.

114
00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.929
So

115
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.380
the thought here is to,

116
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.190
but also because our entire road map is completely

117
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.690
public and because we ship these tiny little NBC S

118
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:20.529
and a new feature will come out, but it'll be

119
00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:21.989
not really usable,

120
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.079
right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year

121
00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.820
and say, OK, like what started in the last year,

122
00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.970
but now is really like a full fledged feature.

123
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.029
What would, what would be coming out of beta,

124
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.910
right?

125
00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.829
Like if we were any other company,

126
00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:41.730
when we started a beta program in this last year, what would we be announcing is G A

127
00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:42.320
at

128
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.260
commit?

129
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.820
That's kind of, that's kind of my thought on it.

130
00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.619
I see a couple of head. Nos. What do you think, Sydney?

131
00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:51.690
Yeah, I think I

132
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.040
was inclined to group some things to say like

133
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.779
vulnerability management because there were tiny little MV CS all the way along.

134
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.279
But if you look at over the course of the year,

135
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.420
we went from this to this,

136
00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:09.309
it makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual

137
00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:10.750
little thing. And then

138
00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.709
the other point was

139
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:19.589
we just had 14.0 can we just, can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here.

140
00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:20.989
Absolutely. Yeah.

141
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.420
Yeah. And vulnerability management was, was one of the,

142
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.510
you know, the features out of we, we looked at 14.0. So I think,

143
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.179
yeah, this is like, let's take the stuff from 14.0

144
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.390
and then maybe add a few more so that we

145
00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.410
can hit kind of different areas of press or give,

146
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.510
give our pr team.

147
00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:42.529
This is kind of like input into our pr team to give them fodder to go out with.

148
00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:45.299
And are we trying to hit three per stage?

149
00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:46.320
I,

150
00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:50.130
yeah, ideally, there's just, you know, three, you know, uh

151
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:52.260
three items per stage.

152
00:06:52.609 --> 00:06:56.380
And then I think y'all made some good notes that OK, we need to add manage.

153
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.200
So I see manage in here. That's excellent.

154
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.470
Um

155
00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:00.899
And

156
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.820
uh integrations we don't,

157
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:07.100
well, actually we have some pretty exciting integration. So we have the,

158
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.609
-- the Jira stuff
-- is pretty good.

159
00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:12.010
There's a couple of things in uh integrations with VS code

160
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:14.089
that could be notable, but

161
00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:21.690
I can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it. And

162
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.100
if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also

163
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.850
kick I was going

164
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.459
Cindy's direction here,

165
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.220
which was uh thinking,

166
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.070
you know, a lot of, and then I call them key iterations, the sort of specific things.

167
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.130
So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations,

168
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.190
but I called them something overall.

169
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.029
So we would have like one thing to call them.

170
00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:44.850
Uh

171
00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:48.559
There's several key iterations aligned with uh giddily cluster,

172
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.079
uh several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like

173
00:07:55.739 --> 00:08:00.940
I, I was shy and calling out UX as, as a bucket except that actually that's,

174
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.290
that's super typical, right?

175
00:08:02.299 --> 00:08:04.769
Like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out,

176
00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:08.049
they almost always have UX as one of their three things and

177
00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:10.899
then they mentioned a laundry list of stuff that aligns to that.

178
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.640
Um So I, I,

179
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.089
you know, forgave myself, uh for doing something.

180
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.910
At first, I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and,

181
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.279
and bucketing some things there.

182
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.079
But actually, when I looked around, that's pretty much how everybody does,

183
00:08:22.549 --> 00:08:23.880
um, a big launch

184
00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:26.420
and in terms of the excitement level that also,

185
00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:28.970
like I went in thinking this is just a two,

186
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.900
I guess part of it is like, I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken

187
00:08:33.058 --> 00:08:36.719
and that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about, but

188
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.640
actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three

189
00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:44.159
excitement level. I wasn't sure exactly where to place things. Um But

190
00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:46.159
I figured I wouldn't,

191
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:49.119
uh like the Cindy's comment have something that's one here anyway.

192
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.400
But I, the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to,

193
00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.840
to bucket them with something.

194
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.039
And, uh, so that's kind of how I came down on it.

195
00:08:59.049 --> 00:09:00.590
I don't know what everyone thinks about that.

196
00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:05.869
Yeah. II, I like that.

197
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:07.849
I

198
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.039
know

199
00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:14.729
I've done a similar, I've taken a similar approach for monitor.

200
00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:18.960
Um, with incident management, there were a bunch of things that we released.

201
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.619
Um, although the core of incident management was part of 12

202
00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:25.320
dot X. I think so.

203
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.280
Um

204
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.830
I did the same over there as well. Yeah,

205
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.700
-- I think that makes
-- sense.

206
00:09:30.989 --> 00:09:31.320
Yeah.

207
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:31.659
And that,

208
00:09:31.669 --> 00:09:35.229
that would help me with the planned stuff as well because there are some

209
00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:39.619
things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they

210
00:09:39.719 --> 00:09:41.700
finally have and that's great. But

211
00:09:42.309 --> 00:09:43.659
um I think, you know, like the

212
00:09:43.859 --> 00:09:45.539
the milestone burn up charts

213
00:09:46.609 --> 00:09:48.039
that that was a two and that's,

214
00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:50.919
that's helpful and I was looking through features and you know,

215
00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:54.909
a actual monthly features that were released in a given month.

216
00:09:54.919 --> 00:09:57.929
I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but it's not very exciting,

217
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.419
but we can bundle that with some other things and,

218
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.039
and, and up level it so that that would be helpful there.

219
00:10:04.049 --> 00:10:06.049
And also Brian about the VS code thing.

220
00:10:06.299 --> 00:10:10.630
One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit

221
00:10:10.789 --> 00:10:14.229
the same month were um community contributions,

222
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.859
which is also kind of cool

223
00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:18.409
is,

224
00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:22.020
is that, is, do we have VS code listed on here?

225
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.440
I didn't add it but I can, I can add that in.

226
00:10:26.719 --> 00:10:27.969
I've got good notes on that.

227
00:10:28.429 --> 00:10:30.679
The extension that had been around for a while

228
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.960
became official was kind of one of the things,

229
00:10:32.969 --> 00:10:35.190
-- but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier
-- than that

230
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.780
and that,

231
00:10:39.669 --> 00:10:41.409
I think that's a, that's a pretty

232
00:10:41.659 --> 00:10:43.690
good note as well. Um

233
00:10:44.419 --> 00:10:47.679
We did that with like our, our terraform module right.

234
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.359
There was like a community module

235
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.679
but now it's officially supported.

236
00:10:51.869 --> 00:10:53.789
So that's, that's the,

237
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.679
you know,

238
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.640
that can be the line, yes or no, whether you can use the thing

239
00:10:58.809 --> 00:11:01.739
uh for a lot of businesses. So I think that's a good one too.

240
00:11:02.239 --> 00:11:06.900
How are we measuring excitement levels? 12 and three is there?

241
00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:10.429
I was, I was looking at

242
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.559
um

243
00:11:11.809 --> 00:11:18.260
maybe MA U as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that

244
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.979
are interested in using that or not.

245
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.650
Uh We probably may not have it for everything,

246
00:11:23.659 --> 00:11:28.460
but at least some of it wherever we have it is it, it's probably something we can,

247
00:11:29.229 --> 00:11:30.479
we can use. Yeah,

248
00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:36.440
but we, of course, we need a benchmark level of what MA U we wanna call. 12 or three.

249
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:37.890
I, I

250
00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:42.159
think it's a little, it's a little bit of a judgment call like um

251
00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:46.280
you know, for example, Cormac was saying, uh

252
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.849
like Epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time.

253
00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:50.929
Now,

254
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.820
depending on how it's asked for, maybe that means it's exciting or it's not, right?

255
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.799
Um

256
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.789
But uh usually when something gets a lot of upvotes

257
00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:02.919
or when there's a lot of demand for it,

258
00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:05.809
then I would, I would bump the excitement level on something like that.

259
00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:07.440
Um,

260
00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.789
certainly if something shipped and a lot of people are using it,

261
00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:14.789
the MA U, that's a, that's another good measure. I don't know that any

262
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.119
one of those needs to kind of be exclusive.

263
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.429
I think it's a bit of a, it's a bit of an individual judgment column just like what is,

264
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.030
what is your feeling based on, you know,

265
00:12:24.419 --> 00:12:26.380
could be anecdotal like you talk to customers

266
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.559
and they're like really hyper excited about this

267
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.099
or,

268
00:12:35.299 --> 00:12:38.099
you know, maybe not, which is, which is OK. I think it's OK.

269
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.299
Um

270
00:12:40.059 --> 00:12:43.059
Harsh responded to my comment about why we

271
00:12:43.219 --> 00:12:46.140
have the low excitement ones and just said something

272
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.880
about ha having him sort of stack ranked.

273
00:12:50.429 --> 00:12:51.780
Yeah, I might,

274
00:12:54.309 --> 00:12:57.630
I might even constrain this is we're not going to highlight lo segments,

275
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.289
but we want to see the full spectrum,

276
00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:02.919
especially in the case we have slim pickings alternately

277
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.830
uh if they are double digit entries, then we can stack rank.

278
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.429
Um

279
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.549
So that's,

280
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.150
that's kind of also helpful there. So

281
00:13:14.479 --> 00:13:18.750
if we have three for all of these that, I mean, it looks like we're gonna get there

282
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.510
and that's gonna be quite a lot of features.

283
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.789
So um

284
00:13:24.659 --> 00:13:26.479
I might constrain it like this.

285
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:28.250
Maybe

286
00:13:28.469 --> 00:13:31.450
you can only give out 112 or three

287
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.270
and, and, and treated as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level.

288
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.799
That doesn't necessarily

289
00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.200
hard to

290
00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:46.080
somebody's one or somebody's 3 may be more important than somebody else's one

291
00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:47.340
depending on the

292
00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:49.030
and I had um

293
00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:51.289
I started by just looking at what was considered

294
00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:54.109
a key feature over the past year uh from,

295
00:13:54.119 --> 00:13:55.030
from create

296
00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:56.190
and,

297
00:13:56.369 --> 00:13:59.359
you know, there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning.

298
00:13:59.669 --> 00:14:01.400
Uh that could be on the list.

299
00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:04.200
Like I could give you 10 things instead of three,

300
00:14:04.729 --> 00:14:08.760
give it, give this just like the rough like pass

301
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.239
and um

302
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.859
like a lot of things recently,

303
00:14:12.869 --> 00:14:16.200
I've been moving between docs and spreadsheets and the spreadsheet to docs.

304
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.409
Uh This, you know, this might,

305
00:14:18.419 --> 00:14:20.739
this might end up or some iteration of this might end up in

306
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.599
a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in pr is like,

307
00:14:23.609 --> 00:14:25.340
OK, out of all of like the,

308
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.419
you know,

309
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:31.380
there's maybe 10 boxes here and three each out of the 30 items which are the top five.

310
00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:32.619
Um

311
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:38.450
Actually, let's just, let's actually just do that, let's just do this like top,

312
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.130
top five overall.

313
00:14:40.539 --> 00:14:44.130
-- We, so this
-- one is apr driven to some degree.

314
00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:47.900
What about like a New and Christie's uh product keynote at commit?

315
00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:50.000
-- Are we that tailing this with
-- that?

316
00:14:50.239 --> 00:14:54.169
So, so this is exactly where this is headed to um

317
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.409
is the idea that um during the product keynote

318
00:14:58.419 --> 00:15:01.500
and then ideally during Kid Sid's keynote as well

319
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.309
that there's some level of like an announcement that we make

320
00:15:05.599 --> 00:15:08.270
that. Then the press cares about that announcement.

321
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.989
Um Again, really tough to do at cl because it's all been around for a while. So this is

322
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:16.929
this is our attempt to head to that area is

323
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.109
to say like these are the announcements of the event

324
00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:20.320
and

325
00:15:20.609 --> 00:15:24.340
yeah, maybe it's some things that have been around for a while, but like now they're

326
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.559
at a level of maturity now, you know, there's,

327
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.559
there's a reason to be excited about this.

328
00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.479
So that's kind of where it's coming from.

329
00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.950
So I put

330
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.109
uh a

331
00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:38.130
top five overall.

332
00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:41.840
Maybe we can just, uh

333
00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:43.909
you know,

334
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.900
we should reserve a spot for plan,

335
00:15:50.909 --> 00:15:54.909
but I'm gonna have to go through and do some aggregating after this.

336
00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:57.599
Just go through the list of what shift in the last 12 months and

337
00:15:57.739 --> 00:15:59.039
re bucket that.

338
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:02.159
So,

339
00:16:02.369 --> 00:16:02.989
uh

340
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.450
maybe we can do like a five minutes kind of like um

341
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.820
just, just time box and uh kind of look at these here.

342
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.219
What do you, what do you all think is a top would be a top five

343
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.250
out of the list of, you know,

344
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.140
20 or 30.

345
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.080
I would say if UX does end up being a, a flag that we fly,

346
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.039
that's an easy one because there's more than just maps

347
00:16:34.049 --> 00:16:37.650
to the created stage that would be considered UX improvement.

348
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.460
OK.

349
00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:47.770
What else

350
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.099
we need to have a security one in there.

351
00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:53.619
We could have either vulnerability management or, um,

352
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.270
I was, what I've been struggling with a little bit is I'd like to kind of group

353
00:16:59.359 --> 00:17:00.739
the, um,

354
00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.280
some of this,

355
00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:04.270
the proprietary scanning,

356
00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:06.130
um,

357
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.569
without making it sound like they're scanning improvements

358
00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.290
because that sounds like they weren't good before.

359
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:15.489
Yeah,

360
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.189
I, let's, let's go with vulnerability management for now.

361
00:17:20.199 --> 00:17:23.530
II, I would agree on that one and I would say that um

362
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:24.939
some of these,

363
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:29.920
we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing.

364
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:30.469
So we might not get

365
00:17:31.239 --> 00:17:31.339
that

366
00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.000
old.

367
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.369
I was,

368
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.560
I mean, we did the fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago.

369
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:41.439
Was it within the past year

370
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.810
for longer?

371
00:17:44.469 --> 00:17:45.209
I thought it was

372
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.229
-- within the past year. I
-- think it was in the last

373
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.380
six, little over six months or

374
00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:50.609
so.

375
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:51.180
It was,

376
00:17:53.219 --> 00:17:55.469
-- it was
-- like last spring or summer and then we

377
00:17:55.479 --> 00:17:59.699
did another set of press around the integration of it because

378
00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:04.329
the pr team liked all the, I mean, we got a lot of attention on the acquisition.

379
00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:06.410
So they had me do a follow up

380
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.449
um on the integration.

381
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.719
-- I just feel like it's kind of worn out
-- now, but

382
00:18:13.189 --> 00:18:16.920
right, that's what I was saying is that the, the fuzzing we already did press on

383
00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.349
so probably will not get another chomp at that.

384
00:18:19.359 --> 00:18:21.439
So I think let's go with Vulnerability management

385
00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:22.449
UN

386
00:18:22.599 --> 00:18:22.839
review,

387
00:18:23.089 --> 00:18:23.119
but

388
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.410
we also have

389
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.599
in terms of proprietary stuff. We've also got,

390
00:18:28.199 --> 00:18:30.989
we replaced one of our scanners with SEM

391
00:18:31.219 --> 00:18:31.609
group

392
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.420
and we did um we have our own proprietary DAS

393
00:18:35.689 --> 00:18:37.760
scanner now that's in,

394
00:18:38.719 --> 00:18:39.969
it's in beta

395
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.500
uh called browser.

396
00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:45.469
So it's our answer to scanning single

397
00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:49.040
page applications which represent a unique challenge.

398
00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:50.000
I think.

399
00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.270
I mean, if I could have to,

400
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.150
it would be vulnerability management and berserker probably.

401
00:18:56.829 --> 00:18:57.300
OK.

402
00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.030
Sere

403
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.699
did get picked up as a line item and a couple of the pieces about get back 14,

404
00:19:08.219 --> 00:19:10.719
which uh between between the,

405
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.339
the proprietary shifts of the vulnerability management,

406
00:19:13.349 --> 00:19:15.280
which would you pick as the number one out of those two?

407
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.890
Probably vulnerability management?

408
00:19:19.369 --> 00:19:19.819
OK.

409
00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:23.939
I'm just kind of scanning the list.

410
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.949
I would probably say like Cooper Net's agent

411
00:19:27.709 --> 00:19:30.160
is something that we've made a lot of investment in.

412
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.750
Although

413
00:19:35.479 --> 00:19:36.339
um I

414
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.729
think the CIN

415
00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:41.660
agent and uh from an integration point of view,

416
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:49.270
uh perhaps the terra farm integration, I think we have a, a lot of customers actually

417
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.829
using that already.

418
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.910
So

419
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.439
I,

420
00:19:52.689 --> 00:19:52.699
I

421
00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:55.180
I'm just gonna call those get

422
00:19:55.489 --> 00:19:55.920
ops

423
00:19:56.949 --> 00:19:59.689
and I'm gonna put like KS agents

424
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:01.520
plus

425
00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.420
has she

426
00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:03.800
for

427
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.089
integrations?

428
00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:10.939
It's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about.

429
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.119
Uh

430
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:13.640
I

431
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.130
Yep,

432
00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:22.449
cool. Well, let's,

433
00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:28.750
you know, let's try to uh this is due Tuesday. I think we wanna try to get this done.

434
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.170
Um

435
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.099
So maybe just uh review this kind of like

436
00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.339
let's just kind of pick top five

437
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.209
maybe something from plant something from C I CD.

438
00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:43.459
-- Uh pipeline
-- editor is definitely an option for C I CD.

439
00:20:43.979 --> 00:20:44.569
Um

440
00:20:45.729 --> 00:20:46.839
Yeah, and there might be a

441
00:20:48.109 --> 00:20:48.390
sorry,

442
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.500
no, sorry. There, there might be a value stream analytics story in there too. Um

443
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.479
If we aggregate it all, it's,

444
00:20:54.489 --> 00:20:58.000
it's a bummer that customizable value stream analytics is 12 dot night.

445
00:20:58.800 --> 00:20:59.329
Um

446
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.410
But uh

447
00:21:01.099 --> 00:21:01.729
yeah, yeah,

448
00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:03.040
there might be

449
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.010
cool. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna ping you on this cormac to add, add

450
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:10.280
a,

451
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:11.650
a top five plan.

452
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.430
Cool.

453
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:20.959
Uh I think

454
00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:26.130
that's a pretty heavy, pretty heavy list just looking at it, you know,

455
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.969
it's pretty cool.

456
00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:28.089
Yeah, that's great.

457
00:21:29.939 --> 00:21:33.910
Yeah, and this is something we don't do, which II I agree. Like we don't,

458
00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.719
we don't often

459
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.260
stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins.

460
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.270
Uh

461
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.020
I was really, I don't, did y'all, did anybody miss uh

462
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.339
what do we call it

463
00:21:47.689 --> 00:21:49.469
assembly, the assembly?

464
00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:52.229
Um

465
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.810
If you missed it, I recommend it.

466
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:58.359
I laughed because like what assembly reminds me of is like when I was in like

467
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.520
a young child in grade school,

468
00:22:00.849 --> 00:22:05.040
you, they'd have this big stack of like carpet, they were like squares of carpet

469
00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:07.640
and you go, like you go into the gym

470
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.160
and you pull off a square of carpet and all the Children

471
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.839
would sit on a square of carpet and that was like you'd have an assembly

472
00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:15.969
so

473
00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:21.910
-- that
-- to put everyone in the gym or like convert the half cafeteria gym,

474
00:22:22.069 --> 00:22:23.910
you know, take away the big barrier

475
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.000
between it so that we can have more room and then

476
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.839
take those carpets that have never been cleaned and just,

477
00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:29.209
you know,

478
00:22:29.489 --> 00:22:31.650
sit on them and it'll be, it'll be great.

479
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.520
Aside, aside from the goofy name, I thought that, um,

480
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.890
and of course we can't talk about any of it on youtube.

481
00:22:38.219 --> 00:22:38.890
But

482
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.150
man, that was like a really awesome look back at like

483
00:22:42.339 --> 00:22:44.810
here's some wins and here's some exciting things that we've done.

484
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.640
Um And so I think we just need to get better at this as a company.

485
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.479
I think this exercise is an opportunity that

486
00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:54.209
um I think we do a little bit of that, but this is doing it more. So,

487
00:22:54.589 --> 00:22:55.430
uh Sonia,

488
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.189
you have some questions here

489
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.339
for elitists.

490
00:23:02.849 --> 00:23:03.780
So,

491
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.699
in the competitive sheet, I was, I mean,

492
00:23:06.709 --> 00:23:12.739
I've already identified the features for CD configure as well as uh monitor.

493
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.109
Uh getting it reviewed from PM.

494
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.900
My guess was,

495
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.239
or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the

496
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.380
same set of competitors that they gonna compare to,

497
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.380
but the right competitors for that particular stage,

498
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.000
right? So for example,

499
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:31.719
for uh for monitor, uh we may not have like a github

500
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.119
or something like that, we would have monitor based competitors

501
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.099
or

502
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:36.829
was

503
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.920
that the understanding because we identified that entire list

504
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.880
of competitors and partners for every single stage?

505
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.439
I thought we were gonna be using those competitors to compare against.

506
00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:55.209
So I just wanted your, your input on what's because I saw uh

507
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.900
some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there.

508
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.099
Um So they may not be relevant, for example,

509
00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:06.099
Cloud be may not be relevant for monitor stage at all.

510
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.040
Um So that's what I wanted to check with you.

511
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.069
Yeah, that's the case. I, I need to go back and look at the spreadsheet.

512
00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:13.930
I mean, if the competitor

513
00:24:14.349 --> 00:24:16.209
does not apply to that particular stage,

514
00:24:16.219 --> 00:24:18.270
they shouldn't be on that tab in the spreadsheet.

515
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.000
So are you saying that you see competitors on

516
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:24.280
that tab for a stage where they don't apply?

517
00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:25.250
Yeah,

518
00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:25.829
I

519
00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.199
think it was

520
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.550
copy

521
00:24:26.739 --> 00:24:27.109
pasted. Each

522
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.920
has the

523
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:28.329
same. Yeah.

524
00:24:28.339 --> 00:24:34.979
So each sheet has uh has uh ad O Atlassian Guitar Jenkins, J Frog and cloud piece,

525
00:24:34.989 --> 00:24:35.400
right?

526
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:35.780
So

527
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.739
that may not be relevant for monitor for configure.

528
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:43.089
It would be a different set of comp competitors that we need to include,

529
00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:45.020
which I think we already identified

530
00:24:45.125 --> 00:24:49.775
a while back. I think we identified top three competitors for every stage.

531
00:24:50.344 --> 00:24:50.714
We,

532
00:24:50.925 --> 00:24:53.645
that's when we tiered them, right? Tier one, tier two, tier three.

533
00:24:53.655 --> 00:24:57.614
So this where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors.

534
00:24:57.625 --> 00:25:00.625
That's probably why I cut and paste them because those are all tier ones.

535
00:25:01.214 --> 00:25:03.094
So we're just focusing on tier one right now.

536
00:25:03.114 --> 00:25:05.255
So if they don't apply to that stage, don't worry about it

537
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:06.810
makes sense.

538
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:10.510
So, just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage.

539
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.550
Right.

540
00:25:12.599 --> 00:25:14.599
So we just use the tier one computers

541
00:25:14.859 --> 00:25:15.790
and if they're not,

542
00:25:16.209 --> 00:25:20.839
if they don't, are not applicable, then we don't have to fill out anything for that.

543
00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.550
-- Yeah,
-- for now. But then we'll move to tier two and tier three, then we'll look at those

544
00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:31.449
and do we need to add a line item for get lab as well? Because I, I think that's

545
00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:32.050
the thing

546
00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:32.790
over here.

547
00:25:33.229 --> 00:25:36.829
-- Yeah, we
-- should add up. I think you asked me that

548
00:25:36.949 --> 00:25:37.930
before. Right.

549
00:25:38.819 --> 00:25:41.469
-- Or someone asked me,
-- I'm just looking at it, Brian

550
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.109
asked

551
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.719
because the way

552
00:25:46.209 --> 00:25:47.219
without it,

553
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.530
you're basically putting all the things that we're better at.

554
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:51.160
Yeah,

555
00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.839
for sure, for sure.

556
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:53.530
Yeah.

557
00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.510
Ideally when we pick like the 10 to 15 features,

558
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.810
those, some of those were like git lab only, some of those were like

559
00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:04.479
git lab didn't have,

560
00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:08.660
well, I thought it was supposed to be not, none of them should be get level only.

561
00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.550
Right. It should be all through the lens of.

562
00:26:11.239 --> 00:26:14.229
Exactly. Yeah, it should be like market lens. So

563
00:26:14.349 --> 00:26:18.790
in an ideal world, most of them are like this is what I'm shopping for this solution.

564
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.650
Some, like some of them might be get level only.

565
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.349
Some of them might be like competitor only

566
00:26:24.589 --> 00:26:26.750
so that it's a, somebody would look at it and be like,

567
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.030
this looks honest and trustworthy and like

568
00:26:29.219 --> 00:26:31.310
a, a accurate assessment of the market.

569
00:26:33.609 --> 00:26:34.859
And then, yeah, I think Sonia

570
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.790
for this just to kind of reiterate for this one.

571
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.709
We're only doing these five competitors. So we'll do the other ones in a later stage.

572
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.510
And then uh

573
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.750
for if, if the

574
00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:49.589
vendor builds like bills themselves as a platform,

575
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.540
then we should specifically call out that they have zero.

576
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.910
So github

577
00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:58.219
Bills itself as a platform, it sells itself that way.

578
00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.660
Um Same with as your Dev

579
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.449
ops. Same with Jay Frog.

580
00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:05.500
Well, they all do for tier one except Jenkins and Clovis

581
00:27:06.739 --> 00:27:07.319
Jenkins. Cloys

582
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.119
does not.

583
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.079
But

584
00:27:09.189 --> 00:27:10.530
what is it? You know, as your dep

585
00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:12.579
you have

586
00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:13.969
uh

587
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.180
Atlassian

588
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.160
and although Atlassian, we still need to figure something out there.

589
00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:21.109
-- As a
-- matter of fact, then I go back and add

590
00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:21.890
Atlassian because I

591
00:27:22.239 --> 00:27:25.890
based on conversation, I think we have to do it. I don't think we can leave them off.

592
00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:27.349
So then I,

593
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:28.130
I don't, I have

594
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:28.650
to look at this.

595
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:29.869
It is

596
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:30.310
Atlassian

597
00:27:30.719 --> 00:27:32.130
-- is on that sheet.
-- Ok.

598
00:27:32.189 --> 00:27:36.550
Yeah, I went back and added them because based on discussion like my, my,

599
00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.229
I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner,

600
00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:41.579
but we can't do that.

601
00:27:41.589 --> 00:27:41.869
So,

602
00:27:42.979 --> 00:27:43.189
so,

603
00:27:43.739 --> 00:27:46.339
so yeah, so for, for those platform,

604
00:27:46.619 --> 00:27:49.739
you know, we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring.

605
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.599
If they have like zero out of 15,

606
00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:53.390
we should call that out.

607
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.780
Um Same with configure stuff for this, you know, any those kind of capabilities,

608
00:28:00.339 --> 00:28:02.530
it be, it be, I think if we took that a step further,

609
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.310
it'd be good to even describe it in a way that doesn't just say our product

610
00:28:05.319 --> 00:28:07.920
stage and use like a value based description

611
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.500
of what monitor and configure mean because otherwise

612
00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:13.810
we're just, no, that's not gonna do any good for us.

613
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.689
Have you guys seen the new infographic that the uh

614
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.199
design team has come up with?

615
00:28:18.339 --> 00:28:19.010
Not yet.

616
00:28:19.939 --> 00:28:20.709
Oh You haven't.

617
00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:21.410
No.

618
00:28:22.119 --> 00:28:23.380
Do we have a link to that

619
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:24.630
quickly? William?

620
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:29.030
-- I don't
-- know or we can throw it in the uh you can throw it in the um notes if you find it.

621
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:29.969
Uh

622
00:28:30.989 --> 00:28:33.160
Let's see who can find it faster.

623
00:28:34.199 --> 00:28:34.209
I

624
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.030
guarantee

625
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.089
you not with the amount of tabs I have open.

626
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.729
Oh my God. That's why I'm like, it probably won't be me.

627
00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.890
So I this is why I send everything to uh Google

628
00:28:46.349 --> 00:28:47.489
uh gmail

629
00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:50.969
because the search is so fast. So I literally

630
00:28:51.579 --> 00:28:54.209
have a folder where all of my get lab pings go

631
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.500
and I can just search for infographic

632
00:28:57.829 --> 00:28:58.030
and

633
00:28:58.199 --> 00:28:58.239
I

634
00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.430
found it. I found it. I

635
00:28:59.619 --> 00:28:59.760
found it.

636
00:29:00.089 --> 00:29:01.530
Who could look at first?

637
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.530
I found it. I found it.

638
00:29:05.079 --> 00:29:05.310
So

639
00:29:06.069 --> 00:29:07.069
this is the one.

640
00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:07.979
So this, there's two,

641
00:29:07.989 --> 00:29:12.479
this is the one for the single to comparison but then for the um but it's gonna look

642
00:29:12.489 --> 00:29:17.199
the same but then here's the one for um I just put it in chat for you guys

643
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.099
and here's the one for the platform players.

644
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:23.890
So,

645
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.260
so we made a,

646
00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.920
we made a couple of decisions along the way. So um

647
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.319
one of the decisions was to just go with stages.

648
00:29:34.849 --> 00:29:35.410
Um

649
00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:39.209
It, it, it would have been like a whole another layer of OK,

650
00:29:39.219 --> 00:29:44.109
if we don't go with just the git lab stages, the 10 stages, what do, what do we use?

651
00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.199
um that has to be determined, reconciled all this kind of stuff

652
00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:48.819
like

653
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:50.900
the, you know,

654
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.250
we kinda,

655
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:56.030
I don't know how long it's been since we updated, those pages have like

656
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.589
not been updated,

657
00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.689
but we kind of are just trying to move towards some sort towards some progress. So

658
00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:02.670
uh

659
00:30:03.229 --> 00:30:04.270
I concur that maybe

660
00:30:04.709 --> 00:30:08.280
configure and monitor is not as descriptive as it could be

661
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.030
but the place where it will. So actually, I'll, I'll share one thing,

662
00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:12.670
it

663
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.290
-- just seems like the right time to do this,
-- right?

664
00:30:15.449 --> 00:30:18.510
Manage is, is even less descriptive than that.

665
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:19.949
So,

666
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.449
so um

667
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.930
the way this is the way this is getting built is off of a data model. So um

668
00:30:27.339 --> 00:30:27.959
in theory,

669
00:30:27.969 --> 00:30:33.069
these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same, right?

670
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.170
Because like we're, we're separating

671
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.069
like like presentation layer from data layer.

672
00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:40.050
Uh

673
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.430
So that's,

674
00:30:41.589 --> 00:30:44.339
it's not gonna be as hard to update in the future as it

675
00:30:44.349 --> 00:30:47.439
currently is where it's a mess of spaghetti code and it's like really,

676
00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:48.650
really difficult to update.

677
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.739
And then the other component is then

678
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.939
not in this iteration, we need to get something live.

679
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:58.250
But in the next iteration you'll click on verify

680
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:01.459
and it'll go down to the list of the 15 features

681
00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.709
and that's where you can describe what the heck of verify is

682
00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.229
-- or what the heck I
-- manage.

683
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.199
So we will have an opportunity because I was

684
00:31:08.209 --> 00:31:09.630
about to say you're gonna hate me for this.

685
00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.420
But like we're,

686
00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:11.819
we're

687
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.430
being cyclical about the same problem we had

688
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.199
there being the audience coming in and

689
00:31:16.209 --> 00:31:18.599
not knowing anything about these specific stages.

690
00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:18.709
That's

691
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:18.920
a

692
00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.660
problem.

693
00:31:20.089 --> 00:31:23.859
That was one of the big things. It's like, OK, 1515 features.

694
00:31:23.869 --> 00:31:26.890
What, what is, what are they? Why do I care? You know?

695
00:31:27.439 --> 00:31:27.859
Yeah,

696
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:28.530
that means

697
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.010
to say that means nothing to me looking at this, this page. Um But quick question.

698
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.400
No, we're on top of it actually, if you read the thread I brought that up,

699
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.660
but she said we can't do it like right now, which I understand

700
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.109
but small thing, what do you guys think about the colors?

701
00:31:45.709 --> 00:31:46.050
Uh

702
00:31:46.479 --> 00:31:47.130
I don't know.

703
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.290
I usually let the designers handle that stuff. They, they,

704
00:31:50.589 --> 00:31:52.239
I, I like,

705
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:52.400
I,

706
00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:56.050
I like the fact that

707
00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.479
there's no red on there.

708
00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.750
Oh You like that?

709
00:31:59.869 --> 00:32:00.560
That's what I was going

710
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:01.449
-- for you.
-- Like

711
00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:05.000
it's not, it's not obviously negative.

712
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.579
Uh So we're saying because it really does lend itself to being a

713
00:32:08.589 --> 00:32:12.199
comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because there's no,

714
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.400
you know, these folks at 37% are in the red and they're terrible.

715
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.040
They just have less green or we would have less green.

716
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:23.439
So it's, it's not, it's not being worse, it's being less good. And I think that,

717
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:25.920
I, I think that lends itself to

718
00:32:26.719 --> 00:32:31.180
working with, you know, all the co opet situations we're talking about,

719
00:32:31.619 --> 00:32:31.790
you know.

720
00:32:32.939 --> 00:32:33.609
Yeah, that's,

721
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.119
that's the goal is we want, we want to generate a helpful asset for the industry.

722
00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:41.880
This is not just like marketing chill, this should be like a helpful page.

723
00:32:42.369 --> 00:32:45.040
Uh So it's like, yeah, the goal is to have a comparison

724
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.069
comparing DEV

725
00:32:46.199 --> 00:32:47.250
ops tool is not a,

726
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.079
you know, this is all of our competitors and why we're better.

727
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:50.640
Yeah.

728
00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.540
Um iiii I think from a competitive mindset and for me, I'm like, let's go hard,

729
00:32:55.579 --> 00:32:57.290
let's put some red on there and

730
00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.520
that's just the way I think, right.

731
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.420
So, but I brought it up and that for now we're gonna stick with the green.

732
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.560
They recommend that we stick with the green and uh see how it goes.

733
00:33:05.569 --> 00:33:06.229
But I don't know,

734
00:33:06.239 --> 00:33:11.930
-- I was feeling the red and yellow too
-- so it is easy on the eyes and um it's, you know,

735
00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:13.339
there's something to be said for that.

736
00:33:13.349 --> 00:33:13.640
So,

737
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:14.890
yeah,

738
00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.160
uh

739
00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:22.050
cool. Well, we're almost up on time but I did wanna share one thing that kind of came in

740
00:33:22.689 --> 00:33:23.390
like

741
00:33:23.579 --> 00:33:24.910
basically Friday,

742
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.969
it was like late Thursday for me.

743
00:33:27.709 --> 00:33:28.650
So this

744
00:33:28.939 --> 00:33:28.949
uh

745
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.569
this is another thing, a lot, a lot of these things,

746
00:33:31.579 --> 00:33:33.349
I don't have like a ton of context on.

747
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.530
Um I just know like we're just trying to up our game.

748
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.729
So like, hey, let's move fast and do the best we can do.

749
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.500
Um

750
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.619
So this is a little bit of a messaging

751
00:33:42.989 --> 00:33:47.180
framework and then the assignment that was given to me was to,

752
00:33:47.189 --> 00:33:49.060
to fill in these boxes here.

753
00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:50.689
So,

754
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.550
uh and then this was the fodder

755
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.380
that I got.

756
00:33:56.339 --> 00:33:58.420
So there was these ones that said like

757
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.589
from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent

758
00:34:02.099 --> 00:34:04.959
and a single source of truth. Countless possibilities.

759
00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:07.920
Honestly, I think this one's really like, really pithy and catchy.

760
00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.228
Uh I really like it. Um

761
00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:15.000
I really liked uh what's the other one that I like? But not everyone does um

762
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.060
all in one for everyone.

763
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.350
So I just uh I don't know, I like, I just think so there's something catchy about that.

764
00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:23.458
Um

765
00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.000
But I know that kind of

766
00:34:25.168 --> 00:34:29.649
catchy is not everyone's cup of tea. All that to say is um

767
00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:31.340
the assignment here was

768
00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:36.530
that I took, it was to write a pithy, few words like

769
00:34:36.708 --> 00:34:38.159
punchy statement

770
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.280
for each of these three things.

771
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.810
Uh So I ended up with a single source of truth. Countless possibilities.

772
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.820
I like that a lot.

773
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.370
Um This one I went with end to end control over your software factory,

774
00:34:50.668 --> 00:34:54.129
not as pithy but or like not as catchy,

775
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:55.250
but

776
00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:55.929
um

777
00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.879
I like it.

778
00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:00.860
So what's the difference between that slide and the

779
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:03.530
-- next one that doesn't have anything under
-- security?

780
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.939
This, this was the um

781
00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:11.780
honestly, so that, so when I first got this, it didn't have this

782
00:35:12.689 --> 00:35:15.159
and it didn't have anything under security. So this, this was

783
00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.399
what I

784
00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:15.669
do

785
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.469
is just your iteration of it.

786
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.050
Yeah, this is, this is mine.

787
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.860
This is I just put here so that I would have like the original statements like,

788
00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:27.689
you know, automate nearly anything, collaborate on everything.

789
00:35:27.899 --> 00:35:29.750
I kind of like that. But I,

790
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:30.979
you know,

791
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.909
this one I hate

792
00:35:33.229 --> 00:35:36.030
scale up, speed up, test up. I don't think anybody tests up.

793
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.800
I think that's really goofy. So

794
00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:38.530
you hate it.

795
00:35:38.939 --> 00:35:40.090
Uh This one I love

796
00:35:40.449 --> 00:35:42.800
that for me. It's I love it or I hate it, right?

797
00:35:43.229 --> 00:35:44.939
-- Um I
-- love, I love how you're just like

798
00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:45.919
uh

799
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.760
so anyway,

800
00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:49.100
the

801
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.020
what I love is just in five minutes now and then

802
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.340
we can just kind of end the call is kind of like

803
00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:55.340
um

804
00:35:56.949 --> 00:35:58.489
anything that you would change this out for,

805
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.209
anything that you would change this out for.

806
00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:02.709
And then actually, let's start here.

807
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:05.449
This one I couldn't pick

808
00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.020
and I'll, I'll tell you why. It's because I, I like things to have parody

809
00:36:10.929 --> 00:36:12.399
in, in their tone,

810
00:36:12.679 --> 00:36:15.179
right? So this is maybe like super nuanced

811
00:36:15.429 --> 00:36:17.780
elements of messaging but I hate it if it's like

812
00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:23.030
a single source of truth, that's like a noun phrase. End to end control.

813
00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.879
That's like a noun

814
00:36:25.649 --> 00:36:29.699
items. So you could say with Git Lab, you get a single source of truth.

815
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.399
With Git lab, you get end to end control.

816
00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:35.429
And you can't say with Git Lab, you get,

817
00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:37.229
move fast with confidence.

818
00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:40.790
-- No,
-- but you can say more speed, less risk. I like that one the best.

819
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.949
I don't like the last one.

820
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.159
I agree.

821
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:47.179
That's, that's why I put this one at top was for that parody.

822
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:52.469
And then so it sounds like kind of y'all's thoughts or that's, that's good as well.

823
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:53.979
Uh Yeah,

824
00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.590
the only thing it might be missing but I

825
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.010
don't know how we do it without over complicating.

826
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.580
It is.

827
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.949
Well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality.

828
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.919
I guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together.

829
00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:10.879
So I, I've talked myself out of not liking that. So, yeah. Good.

830
00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:16.959
Cindy's last blog post had a really good turn of phrase that I stole for for give

831
00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:17.159
out

832
00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.649
14 when she was out,

833
00:37:18.659 --> 00:37:22.879
it was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making it.

834
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.100
-- She said it really elegant
-- and

835
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:25.510
so I just

836
00:37:25.949 --> 00:37:29.379
deliverables, secure the software factory and its deliverables.

837
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.580
-- Yeah,
-- I thought it was good to emphasize both

838
00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:32.280
because they mean

839
00:37:32.949 --> 00:37:32.969
it

840
00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:33.409
was nice.

841
00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:36.719
Yeah.

842
00:37:36.729 --> 00:37:42.120
So you could say um secure and control your software factory and its deliverables.

843
00:37:42.129 --> 00:37:46.040
Maybe that would encompass both thoughts.

844
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:51.189
I'm,

845
00:37:51.409 --> 00:37:52.969
I'm not a big fan of the,

846
00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.570
it's, it's deliverables. Is there, uh, can we say like

847
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.750
your software factory and your software or your, your

848
00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:02.879
software or in your product?

849
00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.340
Product? Sounds like

850
00:38:05.919 --> 00:38:07.030
-- car manufacturer.
-- I

851
00:38:07.429 --> 00:38:07.469
say

852
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.600
IP, here, but it just doesn't sound right.

853
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.020
And that's always, it's always shorthand.

854
00:38:12.699 --> 00:38:12.979
Yeah,

855
00:38:13.729 --> 00:38:14.010
I

856
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.729
like this one better.

857
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.370
Yeah, I think I do too

858
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.459
but,

859
00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:23.889
but I appreciate the thought, Brian.

860
00:38:25.439 --> 00:38:26.020
Uh

861
00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:27.100
And then

862
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:30.959
the last thing I'll say is so this is, this is my attempt to,

863
00:38:30.969 --> 00:38:32.899
to channel my inner Ash withers.

864
00:38:33.629 --> 00:38:36.899
Um I think Ash is like super good at

865
00:38:37.209 --> 00:38:37.850
just

866
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.989
again, just like the the catchier like the turn of phrase element to it.

867
00:38:42.879 --> 00:38:43.540
Um

868
00:38:43.889 --> 00:38:46.699
And so like this kind of idea like single source of truth,

869
00:38:46.709 --> 00:38:50.300
countless possibilities or all in one for everyone.

870
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.439
There's something catchy about this. So, so here I was trying to like

871
00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:57.000
envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity?

872
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:01.139
It's like it's velocity with confidence is what is what you get?

873
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.290
Um

874
00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:07.100
-- I
-- like your move fast with confidence better than increased speed and stay on track.

875
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.120
Yeah, so I was trying to, I was thinking of like,

876
00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:10.929
you know,

877
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.810
if you're like, if you're in a race car

878
00:39:14.169 --> 00:39:14.790
and like

879
00:39:14.939 --> 00:39:18.120
you go like super, super fast, like let's say you're in the bike race, right?

880
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.969
And you're going so fast and somebody holds out the sign

881
00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:23.419
and then like half of the bike race collapses,

882
00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.300
right?

883
00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.070
Um

884
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.179
So it's almost kind of like you can,

885
00:39:28.189 --> 00:39:31.179
you can keep going like faster and faster and faster.

886
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:35.080
And if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack,

887
00:39:35.189 --> 00:39:36.939
you're not gonna get tripped up by it

888
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.790
because get labs, you know,

889
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.320
it's testing is gonna catch that and security is gonna catch that.

890
00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:43.419
Um, all of those elements

891
00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.320
that allow you to move faster,

892
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.260
but to do so with confidence because otherwise you're like

893
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.129
the faster you go then it gets more dangerous.

894
00:39:50.149 --> 00:39:52.770
So trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where I was like,

895
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.090
stay on track, but I, I didn't like it either.

896
00:39:55.689 --> 00:39:55.729
You

897
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:56.310
-- just
-- open

898
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:56.580
the

899
00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:56.919
door

900
00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:57.100
for

901
00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:57.350
NASCAR

902
00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:58.649
Partnership.

903
00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:03.580
Hey NASCAR goes fast and turns left because it get loud.

904
00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:07.229
So,

905
00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:08.629
Ricky

906
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.729
demograph.

907
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:10.909
So yeah.

908
00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:14.040
So I don't think I like that one and then I think between these two,

909
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.120
I like move fast with confidence, but I don't like the,

910
00:40:17.419 --> 00:40:19.679
the verbiage of it because it doesn't have parody.

911
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.959
So that's where I think.

912
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.679
Do you wanna add,

913
00:40:22.919 --> 00:40:25.520
maybe we can add high confidence or more

914
00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.860
confidence at the end of your first statement.

915
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:29.320
So it kind of combines

916
00:40:30.159 --> 00:40:32.310
all of it. So more speed, less risk,

917
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.050
high

918
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.760
confidence,

919
00:40:34.379 --> 00:40:34.550
confidence

920
00:40:34.669 --> 00:40:38.639
-- is kind
-- of overused. Anyway, like I see a lot of competitors and vendors using it.

921
00:40:38.649 --> 00:40:42.750
I really like the first one just more speed, less risk. Bam no trade offs.

922
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.159
You know, just that how it is.

923
00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:45.310
Mm

924
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.290
oh no trade offs.

925
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.820
That's one of my go tos I love that one.

926
00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:54.419
-- This,
-- this gets into the uh

927
00:40:54.939 --> 00:40:56.219
no trade offs.

928
00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:56.989
The en

929
00:40:57.149 --> 00:41:00.780
the engineering me says there's never no tradeoffs.

930
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.110
That's like saying like 100% secure.

931
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:07.139
Like this is why we always say mitigate, right? We always say like

932
00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.060
risk or less risk. You never say no

933
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.530
with messaging, right? I mean, not everything, you know,

934
00:41:14.139 --> 00:41:17.260
-- not
-- just more speed, less risk with confidence.

935
00:41:18.949 --> 00:41:19.370
Mm

936
00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:22.229
But

937
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:22.810
yeah,

938
00:41:24.909 --> 00:41:25.840
more speed.

939
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.580
The Ricky Bobby and me really did like the no trade offs there. Parker.

940
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.010
-- Oh, is that was that from?
-- Uh no, but it could have been.

941
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.419
It's something Ricky Bobby would have said if anyone hasn't seen Talladega Nights,

942
00:41:39.429 --> 00:41:41.620
-- they should, that's
-- the homework for this weekend

943
00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:42.570
to come back

944
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:43.260
and

945
00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:45.860
we talk about it on Monday in our little social.

946
00:41:46.455 --> 00:41:47.564
I often say

947
00:41:47.895 --> 00:41:51.145
thank you little £8.05 ounce baby

948
00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:52.574
with the golden diapers.

949
00:41:53.135 --> 00:41:55.754
I say that so often that I just think everybody has seen

950
00:41:55.764 --> 00:41:58.834
Talladega Nights but then I realize that people that haven't are like

951
00:41:58.945 --> 00:42:00.165
is really weird.

952
00:42:00.294 --> 00:42:00.754
And then,

953
00:42:01.094 --> 00:42:03.475
and then next week we'll watch Step Brothers.

954
00:42:03.935 --> 00:42:06.955
-- That's another great one. So much room for
-- activities.

955
00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:13.919
Ok. Um I'm gonna go with uh more speed, less risk and

956
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:14.899
um

957
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.540
I think this is due at the end of the day. So any additional thoughts

958
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.129
I'm actually gonna un tag.

959
00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:24.419
It's strong. All those are, you know,

960
00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.449
cool.

961
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.479
-- Those
-- are good.

962
00:42:26.939 --> 00:42:27.520
Awesome.

963
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:31.989
Well, uh, this was kind of fun to do a little bit of like working together session

964
00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:32.929
and, uh,

965
00:42:33.929 --> 00:42:34.389
keep it,

966
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.149
keep it rocking.

967
00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:40.229
Good to see everybody. See you soon.
