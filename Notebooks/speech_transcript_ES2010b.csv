0.0,27.220000000000002,SPEAKER_03," So sorry, I got the the floor now? Which one is it? Yes, it was. Third one? Do you want us to do it really fast?"
27.220000000000002,31.32,SPEAKER_03, I think it is a pretty quick one.
50.26,52.26,SPEAKER_02, I'm gonna put it in the middle.
52.26,54.26,SPEAKER_02, That was quite good.
54.26,56.26,," Yeah, that was quite good."
56.26,57.26,, Okay.
57.26,58.26,, Okay.
58.26,59.26,, Okay.

70.25999999999999,71.25999999999999,, Okay.
71.25999999999999,72.25999999999999,SPEAKER_04, Okay.
72.25999999999999,73.25999999999999,SPEAKER_04, Okay.
73.25999999999999,74.25999999999999,SPEAKER_04, There we go.
74.25999999999999,75.25999999999999,SPEAKER_04, Okay.
75.26,77.26,, Okay.
77.26,78.26,, Okay.
78.26,79.26,, Okay.
79.26,80.26,, Okay.
80.26,81.26,, Okay.
81.26,82.26,, Okay.
82.26,83.26,, Okay.
83.26,85.26,SPEAKER_02," Um, welcome to our second meeting."
85.26,86.26,SPEAKER_02, This is the functional design meeting.
86.26,89.26,SPEAKER_02, And I hope you all have a good individual working time.
89.26,90.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
90.26,91.26,SPEAKER_02, Let's get started.
91.26,92.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
92.26,93.26,SPEAKER_02, Here's the agenda for the meeting.
93.26,96.26,SPEAKER_02," After the opening, um, I am going to the clear the role of secretary."
96.26,97.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
97.26,98.26,SPEAKER_02, Then we're going to have three presentations from each of you.
98.26,99.26,SPEAKER_02, Then we're going to discuss some new project requirements.
99.26,105.26,SPEAKER_02," Um, going to come to decision on the functions of their mode control and then we're going to close up the meeting."
105.26,107.26,SPEAKER_02, And we're going to do the some of that for minutes.
107.26,108.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
108.26,109.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
109.26,113.26,SPEAKER_02," First, I want to discuss the goals of this meeting."
113.26,116.26,SPEAKER_02," Um, I'm going to go to the next meeting."
116.26,117.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
117.26,118.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
118.26,121.26,SPEAKER_02," First, I want to discuss the goals of this meeting."
121.26,122.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
122.26,123.26,, Okay.
123.26,127.26,SPEAKER_02," First, I want to discuss the goals of this meeting."
127.26,137.26,SPEAKER_02," First, we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be filled by this remote control."
137.26,141.26,SPEAKER_02, And then we're going to determine the technical functions.
141.26,143.26,SPEAKER_02," What is the effect of the app, Radis?"
143.26,146.26,SPEAKER_02, What actually is it supposed to do?
146.26,151.26,SPEAKER_02, What do people pick up a remote and use it for?
151.26,155.26,SPEAKER_02," And then lastly, we're going to determine its working design."
155.26,157.26,SPEAKER_02, How exactly will it perform its functions?
157.26,160.26,SPEAKER_02, That's the whole technical side of.
160.26,161.26,, Okay.
161.26,168.26,SPEAKER_02, I'm just giving it because it's like making some notes.
168.26,169.26,, Okay.
169.26,170.26,SPEAKER_04, Oh.
170.26,177.26,SPEAKER_02," Well, let's go ahead and take a look at that."
177.26,178.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
178.26,183.26,SPEAKER_02, So what I want to do right now is hear from all three of you on your research.
183.26,184.26,SPEAKER_02, Say you just did.
184.26,187.26,SPEAKER_02, Who would like to start us off?
187.26,190.26,SPEAKER_00," Oh, no, my good."
190.26,191.26,SPEAKER_00, First.
191.26,192.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
192.26,194.26,SPEAKER_02, Do you have a PowerPoint or no?
194.26,195.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
195.26,196.26,SPEAKER_00, It should be in the.
196.26,198.26,SPEAKER_01, Do you want us to do our PowerPoint now?
198.26,199.26,SPEAKER_00," No, you can."
199.26,201.26,SPEAKER_00, You can see it yourself actually.
201.26,202.26,SPEAKER_03," Oh, did you send it?"
202.26,205.26,SPEAKER_03, Put it in the project documents.
205.26,206.26,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
206.26,207.26,, Okay.
207.26,208.26,, Okay.
208.26,209.26,, Okay.
209.26,210.26,, Okay.
210.26,211.26,, Okay.
211.26,212.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
212.26,213.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
213.26,214.26,, Okay.
214.26,215.26,, Okay.
215.26,216.26,, Okay.
216.26,217.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
217.26,218.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
218.26,219.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
219.26,220.26,, Great.
220.26,221.26,, Okay.
221.26,222.26,SPEAKER_00, Great.
222.26,230.26,SPEAKER_00," Um, well, the function of a remote control as what we've been informed by."
230.26,231.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
231.26,232.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
232.26,233.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
233.26,234.26,SPEAKER_00, Great.
234.26,239.26,SPEAKER_00," So, we've been informed is basically to send messages to the television set."
239.26,240.26,SPEAKER_00," For example, switch it on."
240.26,241.26,SPEAKER_00, Switch it off.
241.26,242.26,SPEAKER_00, Go to this channel.
242.26,243.26,SPEAKER_00, Go to channel nine.
243.26,250.26,SPEAKER_00," Turn the volume up, et cetera."
250.26,263.26,SPEAKER_00," Some of the considerations is just, for example, what it needs to include is the numbers, you know, zero to nine so you can move to channel the power button on slash off."
263.26,265.26,SPEAKER_00, The channel going up and down.
265.26,269.26,SPEAKER_00, Volume going up and down and then mute.
269.26,271.26,SPEAKER_00, I mute function.
271.26,281.26,SPEAKER_00," And then functions for VHS DVD, for example, play, rewind, fast forward stop pause, enter, and enter would be for like, you know, the menus."
281.26,293.26,SPEAKER_00," And then other menus for DB as well as TV, whether that means like, we can go and decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of the menus."
293.26,296.26,SPEAKER_00, And we can decide if that's what we want in it.
296.26,302.26,SPEAKER_00," So, if we want to include that on the remote or if that's something that would stay on the TV itself, for example."
302.26,303.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
303.26,305.26,SPEAKER_00, These are two examples.
305.26,309.26,SPEAKER_00, And you can see on the left it's got a lot more buttons.
309.26,312.26,SPEAKER_00," And I don't know if you can read it, but it says step."
312.26,315.26,SPEAKER_00, Go to freeze.
315.26,316.26,SPEAKER_00, Slow.
316.26,317.26,SPEAKER_00, Repeat.
317.26,318.26,SPEAKER_00, Program.
318.26,319.26,SPEAKER_00, mute.
319.26,321.26,SPEAKER_00, And so there's some of the buttons.
321.26,323.26,SPEAKER_00, And so it gives you an idea of one example.
323.26,325.26,SPEAKER_00," And then on the right, it's a lot more simpler."
325.26,326.26,SPEAKER_00, It's got volume.
326.26,330.26,SPEAKER_00," It's got the play, like circle set, which is play, rewind."
330.26,335.26,SPEAKER_00," But it's also, what is fast forward is also like next on a menu."
335.26,339.26,SPEAKER_00, So you have functions that are duplicating.
339.26,342.26,SPEAKER_00, And you have a mute button in the numbers and the eject and the power buttons.
342.26,347.26,SPEAKER_00," Like it's YouTube, different kinds of more complex and more simple version."
347.26,348.26,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
348.26,352.26,SPEAKER_00," And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider."
352.26,358.26,SPEAKER_00, Like what functions do we want it to include and how simple complex it should be?
358.26,362.26,SPEAKER_00, And what functions it needs to complete?
362.26,365.26,SPEAKER_00, What are needed to complete the inflation process?
365.26,372.26,SPEAKER_00," Because something that also has to be considered and it's going to be hopefully a one-time thing when you set it up, it should be set to go."
372.26,376.26,SPEAKER_00, But we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up in the first place.
376.26,380.26,SPEAKER_00, And so that's it.
380.26,381.26,SPEAKER_02, All right.
381.26,382.26,SPEAKER_02, Very good presentation.
382.26,383.26,SPEAKER_02, Thank you.
383.26,386.26,SPEAKER_02, I'll speak with such authority on that.
386.26,387.26,SPEAKER_02, Mm.
387.26,388.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
388.26,391.26,SPEAKER_02, Who would like to follow that one up?
391.26,392.26,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, but we can go."
392.26,393.26,SPEAKER_02, I think so.
393.26,394.26,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
394.26,397.26,SPEAKER_02, Do you want me to run it or you can make sure that it's okay?
397.26,398.26,, Okay.
398.26,399.26,SPEAKER_02, You do.
399.26,401.26,SPEAKER_02, Functional requirements?
401.26,402.26,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
402.26,403.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
403.26,410.26,, Okay.
410.26,411.26,SPEAKER_02, All right.
411.26,414.26,SPEAKER_02, Now we have Courtney with the function requirements.
414.26,415.26,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
415.26,416.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
416.26,429.26,SPEAKER_01, So we tested 100 subjects in our lab and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls.
429.26,431.26,SPEAKER_01, 75% think they're ugly.
431.26,436.26,SPEAKER_01, 80% want they are willing to spend more which is good news for us.
436.26,449.26,SPEAKER_01, If we make it look fancier and basically we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there but they need it needs to be snazzy and but yet simple.
449.26,451.26,SPEAKER_01, So that's really what we need to do.
451.26,452.26,SPEAKER_01, Wait.
452.26,455.26,SPEAKER_01, And we need we need it to be simple yet.
455.26,457.26,SPEAKER_01, It needs to be high tech looking.
457.26,458.26,SPEAKER_00, So that really what?
458.26,463.26,SPEAKER_01, Like they like I guess use the buttons a lot.
463.26,464.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
464.26,465.26,, Yeah.
465.26,466.26,SPEAKER_01, I don't know.
466.26,467.26,SPEAKER_01, It's from my research.
467.26,468.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
468.26,470.26,SPEAKER_01, My team wasn't very.
470.26,471.26,SPEAKER_01, Oh sorry.
471.26,478.26,SPEAKER_02, What do you mean by the current remote controls not match well the operating behavior of the user.
478.26,481.26,SPEAKER_01, I think it's like the engineering versus user.
481.26,482.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
482.26,486.26,SPEAKER_01, Whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex.
486.26,491.26,SPEAKER_01, And users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained more.
491.26,492.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
492.26,494.26,SPEAKER_01, Because they only use 10% of the buttons really.
494.26,495.26,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
495.26,496.26,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
496.26,497.26,SPEAKER_03, I'm going to use 10% of her brains.
497.26,498.26,SPEAKER_01, Good point.
498.26,499.26,SPEAKER_03, It works.
499.26,500.26,SPEAKER_01, It's unnecessary.
500.26,501.26,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
501.26,502.26,SPEAKER_01, Right.
502.26,503.26,SPEAKER_01, That's the next slide.
503.26,513.26,SPEAKER_01, And so people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know because you probably lose your remote control all the time much like any small place like cellphone.
513.26,523.26,SPEAKER_01, And they we need something simple because most people well 34% say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one.
523.26,528.26,SPEAKER_01, And we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote.
528.26,531.26,SPEAKER_01, I mean they do need to be able to identify it.
531.26,534.26,SPEAKER_01, And RSI I'm not very sure what that is.
534.26,535.26,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
535.26,538.26,SPEAKER_01, It is important for the rocket control world.
538.26,539.26,SPEAKER_00, Wait.
539.26,542.26,SPEAKER_00, Is that like your ergonomics like your hand movement or something?
542.26,543.26,SPEAKER_00, It could be.
543.26,548.26,SPEAKER_03, It possibly really needs to provide more information about RSI.
548.26,549.26,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
549.26,550.26,SPEAKER_01, That's what my website said.
550.26,551.26,SPEAKER_01, I don't know why.
551.26,553.26,SPEAKER_02, I think that's a pretty good guess though.
553.26,554.26,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
554.26,555.26,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to assume so.
555.26,556.26,SPEAKER_01, I think we're too cool.
556.26,558.26,SPEAKER_01, No as remote control experts.
558.26,566.66,SPEAKER_01, But also so the channel the volume and the power buttons are most important on our company website.
566.66,571.66,SPEAKER_01, You can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used.
571.66,574.66,SPEAKER_01, But those are the definitely the top ones.
574.66,575.66,SPEAKER_04, Okay.
575.66,576.66,SPEAKER_01, Next slide.
576.66,577.66,SPEAKER_01, Yes.
577.66,583.66,SPEAKER_01, And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design but it really needs to be simple.
583.66,594.66,SPEAKER_01, So saying from your side your presentation the engineering versus the user specified or modes I think that we should go with something that's more user friendly.
594.66,596.66,SPEAKER_01, We're the engineering ones.
596.66,600.66,SPEAKER_01, The boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is.
600.66,608.66,SPEAKER_01, The functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons we really need on it.
608.66,612.66,SPEAKER_01, And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers.
612.66,621.66,SPEAKER_01, So even though we need a small number of buttons we also need to take in like our most people going to be using it for a DVD player or a Tivo.
621.66,626.66,SPEAKER_01, What exactly are we using it for as well as the age range.
626.66,632.66,SPEAKER_01, So we need a hip but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product.
632.66,638.66,SPEAKER_01, And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing.
638.66,641.66,SPEAKER_01, They really consumers are really interested in it.
641.66,648.66,SPEAKER_01, And since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for our remote for it to be more high class.
648.66,649.66,SPEAKER_01, And so just consider it.
649.66,654.66,SPEAKER_02, Just to clarify by speech recognition you may say channel five.
654.66,655.66,SPEAKER_01, So yeah.
655.66,656.66,SPEAKER_00, Okay.
656.66,658.66,SPEAKER_00, I would just say where are you?
658.66,659.66,SPEAKER_00, I think beats.
659.66,660.66,SPEAKER_00, You know?
660.66,661.66,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
661.66,662.66,SPEAKER_01, I guess we can interpret it.
662.66,666.66,SPEAKER_01, Like we can just try out different types of speech recognition with an arm.
666.66,667.66,SPEAKER_02, Didn't they?
667.66,673.66,SPEAKER_02, Didn't their rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on TV
673.66,677.66,SPEAKER_00, and it would promote with beats so that if you're like the remote phone used to do.
677.66,678.66,SPEAKER_02, Oh yeah.
678.66,680.66,SPEAKER_00, You know like go to the link.
680.66,682.66,SPEAKER_02, Thanks. Yeah.
682.66,683.66,SPEAKER_02, If it's where they are.
683.66,684.66,, Okay.
684.66,687.66,SPEAKER_02, I'm ready for our last presentation.
687.66,688.66,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
688.66,689.66,SPEAKER_03, I'm just trying to move it.
689.66,690.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
690.66,691.66,, Okay.
691.66,700.66,SPEAKER_03, I think it should be there.
700.66,701.66,SPEAKER_03, Working design.
701.66,702.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
702.66,709.66,SPEAKER_03, I didn't get a chance to complete this one.
709.66,710.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
710.66,711.66,SPEAKER_03, So I'm going to go to the next one.
711.66,712.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
712.66,713.66,SPEAKER_03, So I'm going to go to the next one.
713.66,714.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
714.66,715.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
715.66,716.66,SPEAKER_03, So.
716.66,717.66,SPEAKER_03, Method.
717.66,718.66,SPEAKER_03, Method of our design.
718.66,723.66,SPEAKER_03, I think I just started listing some of the things that we actually need to put into this.
723.66,724.66,SPEAKER_03, We need a power source.
724.66,729.66,SPEAKER_03, We're going to need a smart chip if we're going to make it multifunctional.
729.66,733.66,SPEAKER_03, Extra functions will probably need an additional chip.
733.66,738.66,SPEAKER_03, Either that or this smart chip will have to be extremely smart.
739.66,741.66,SPEAKER_01, What exactly is a smart chip?
741.66,748.66,SPEAKER_03, Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed in design so that it can complete a fair range of functions.
748.66,751.66,SPEAKER_00," Well, how much extra would the additional chip be?"
751.66,754.66,SPEAKER_00, Is that going to push this over a production process?
754.66,760.66,SPEAKER_03, I wouldn't think so because we could probably get it from like a bulb from a newer company.
760.66,763.66,SPEAKER_03, They tend to sell their chips pretty cheap.
763.66,764.66,, Okay.
764.66,765.66,, Yep.
765.66,766.66,SPEAKER_03, Nothing here.
766.66,767.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
767.66,768.66,SPEAKER_03, Power source.
768.66,773.66,SPEAKER_03, I figured batteries because they're easily available.
773.66,780.66,SPEAKER_03, Typically remote has either two double A's or four triple A's sometimes three.
780.66,785.66,SPEAKER_03, It really kind of depends on the size of the actual remote itself.
785.66,792.66,SPEAKER_03," A large on-off button demographically, we're moving towards an older generation of people."
792.66,796.66,SPEAKER_03, So a large on-off button would probably be good.
796.66,798.66,SPEAKER_03, Selection button for various entertainment devices.
798.66,807.66,SPEAKER_03, So you want something that will permit you to select the DVD player or the TV or the stereo system.
807.66,812.66,SPEAKER_03," Smart chip that permits, sorry, universal application."
812.66,817.66,SPEAKER_03," Again, something that will allow us to skip over between devices."
817.66,820.66,SPEAKER_03, That's kind of it.
820.66,827.66,SPEAKER_03, This is my 52nd design.
827.66,829.66,SPEAKER_03, Power source over here.
829.66,833.66,SPEAKER_03, We're going to have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it.
833.66,835.66,SPEAKER_03, You're going to need the switch.
835.66,842.66,SPEAKER_03, Extra bulb could just be for flashiness.
842.66,847.66,SPEAKER_03," Subcomponent, which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of it."
847.66,855.66,SPEAKER_03," The device, the chip, and of course the infrared bulb, so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to."
855.66,856.66,SPEAKER_01, So what exactly are we looking at?
856.66,858.66,SPEAKER_01, It's like the front of the ...
858.66,860.66,SPEAKER_01, This is just like a rough schematic.
860.66,862.66,SPEAKER_03, So this is the internal workings.
862.66,864.66,SPEAKER_02, So the red would be the front of the remote though.
864.66,868.66,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, that's going to be what's communicating with the TV, but the other bullet thing is good."
868.66,870.66,SPEAKER_00, It's just to indicate I'm doing something.
870.66,872.66,SPEAKER_00, Sort of like a ...
872.66,873.66,SPEAKER_00, Like a string of batteries.
873.66,882.66,SPEAKER_03," You don't have to stare at that infrared because when the battery starts dying on your remote, currently you have to actually stare at that bulb and go, okay, but I push this button."
882.66,883.66,SPEAKER_03, Is that okay?
883.66,884.66,SPEAKER_03, We can skip that.
884.66,885.66,SPEAKER_02, We can skip that.
885.66,886.66,SPEAKER_03, We'll see right?
886.66,887.66,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
887.66,888.66,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
888.66,889.66,SPEAKER_03, So you can put it in the dark.
889.66,890.66,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, that's good."
890.66,892.66,SPEAKER_03, We should make it go in the dark.
892.66,893.66,SPEAKER_03, Definitely.
893.66,894.66,SPEAKER_02," Hey, next."
894.66,896.66,SPEAKER_02," Yeah, that's it."
896.66,897.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
897.66,901.66,SPEAKER_02, Anything you want to add for personal preferences though?
901.66,904.66,SPEAKER_02," You said I already that we need a large enough button, you think?"
904.66,909.66,SPEAKER_03," I think that that's a good idea because, you know, that's one of the most important buttons."
909.66,910.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
910.66,912.66,SPEAKER_00," Well, it should be larger buttons in general."
912.66,914.66,SPEAKER_00, Like the examples that I had there is quite small.
914.66,918.66,SPEAKER_00, So should we try and go for something that has larger buttons?
918.66,919.66,SPEAKER_01, I think we should.
919.66,924.66,SPEAKER_01," Like I think that would be in for the design, sorry."
924.66,927.66,SPEAKER_01, I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote.
927.66,929.66,SPEAKER_01, Because most of our modes have small square buttons.
929.66,932.66,SPEAKER_01, I think we should do something like a bigger and round.
932.66,933.66,SPEAKER_01," Like, yeah."
933.66,934.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
934.66,935.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
935.66,941.66,SPEAKER_02," Let's talk about all of our, we'll come to a decision later about all the components that we need to include."
941.66,944.66,SPEAKER_02, Let's wrap up this one.
944.66,952.66,SPEAKER_02," And I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint because we need to discuss the new project requirements, which you might have already seen flashed up on the screen bit earlier."
952.66,953.66,SPEAKER_02, Wait.
953.66,954.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
954.66,955.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
955.66,956.66,, Okay.
956.66,957.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
957.66,958.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
958.66,959.66,SPEAKER_02, All right.
959.66,960.66,SPEAKER_02, Here we go.
960.66,961.66,SPEAKER_02, View product requirements.
961.66,964.66,SPEAKER_02," First, it's only going to be a TV remote."
964.66,967.66,SPEAKER_02, We're trying not to overcomplicate things.
967.66,970.66,SPEAKER_02," So no DVD, no TV, no stereo."
970.66,973.66,SPEAKER_02, That can be multifunctional.
973.66,974.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
974.66,978.66,SPEAKER_02, And we need to promote our company more.
978.66,983.66,SPEAKER_02, So we need to somehow include our color and our company slowly.
983.66,986.66,SPEAKER_02, And on the remote.
986.66,991.66,SPEAKER_02, We're trying to get our name out there in the world.
991.66,992.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
992.66,995.66,SPEAKER_02, And you know what teletext is?
995.66,996.66,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
996.66,997.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
997.66,998.66,SPEAKER_02, And states we don't have it.
998.66,1002.66,SPEAKER_02, But it's like they just have this channel where it just has news and weather kind of sports.
1002.66,1005.66,SPEAKER_02, It's very bland looking.
1005.66,1007.66,SPEAKER_02, It's just text down the screen.
1007.66,1008.66,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1008.66,1009.66,SPEAKER_02," Not even, yeah."
1009.66,1011.66,SPEAKER_02," Just like, black with running along the bottom."
1011.66,1012.66,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1012.66,1014.66,SPEAKER_03, And we also get the kind of the TV guys.
1014.66,1018.66,SPEAKER_01, Or we just like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom.
1018.66,1019.66,SPEAKER_01, Kind of the entire screen.
1019.66,1020.66,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1020.66,1024.6599999999999,SPEAKER_03, The screen is just running information at random.
1024.6599999999999,1027.6599999999999,SPEAKER_00, You can see more of the secret pics in the news.
1027.6599999999999,1030.6599999999999,SPEAKER_00, So it's like a separate channel from like way to watching.
1030.6599999999999,1032.6599999999999,SPEAKER_02, But it's becoming outdated now because of the internet.
1032.6599999999999,1036.6599999999999,SPEAKER_02, Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news.
1036.6599999999999,1038.6599999999999,SPEAKER_02, And we have 24 hour news channels now too.
1038.6599999999999,1041.6599999999999,SPEAKER_02, So those are our new product requirements.
1041.66,1042.66,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1042.66,1045.66,SPEAKER_03, So do we have to include the company color within that?
1045.66,1046.66,SPEAKER_02, Yes.
1046.66,1048.66,SPEAKER_02, It's kind of the logo.
1048.66,1049.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1049.66,1052.66,SPEAKER_02, I'm going to go over here.
1052.66,1053.66,SPEAKER_02, Yellow.
1053.66,1065.66,SPEAKER_02, What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do.
1065.66,1067.66,SPEAKER_02, And then we'll close up the meeting.
1067.66,1068.66,SPEAKER_02, So.
1068.66,1069.66,SPEAKER_02, All right.
1069.66,1076.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1076.66,1090.66,SPEAKER_02, So our target group is you mentioned older people.
1090.66,1093.66,SPEAKER_02, Would it just be universal for everyone you think?
1093.66,1104.66,SPEAKER_02," Because I think even if something has large buttons as long as they're not childishly large, like, even technically non-tactically challenged people are going to use it."
1104.66,1106.66,SPEAKER_02," I mean, they want something user friendly."
1106.66,1115.66,SPEAKER_03," So well, even if we kept the regular standard size of remote, if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra."
1115.66,1117.66,SPEAKER_03, Because they're saying they only use 10% of them.
1117.66,1118.66,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1118.66,1122.66,SPEAKER_03, Then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent size buttons.
1122.66,1123.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1123.66,1134.66,SPEAKER_02," So we want for our target group, would we say, I mean, young and old, all age ranges all not kids, obviously, right?"
1134.66,1138.66,SPEAKER_01," No, kids need to know these are most of the things."
1138.66,1141.66,SPEAKER_01," They've got a picture between Disney Channel, Cartoon Network."
1141.66,1142.66,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1142.66,1143.66,SPEAKER_02, So we're going to go anymore.
1143.66,1144.66,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1144.66,1148.66,SPEAKER_02, I think we need to adult in the age range.
1148.66,1159.66,SPEAKER_02," What about technical specifications, like how technically literate eye these people who are going to be using our vote?"
1159.66,1162.66,SPEAKER_01," I would say we should say, dumber than the average person."
1162.66,1163.66,SPEAKER_01, Appreciate it.
1163.66,1165.66,SPEAKER_02, Go for the lowest denominator.
1165.66,1166.66,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1166.66,1167.66,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1167.66,1168.66,SPEAKER_03, Okay.
1168.66,1169.66,SPEAKER_03, High school age.
1169.66,1171.66,SPEAKER_03, So they need no technical experience to operate.
1171.66,1177.66,SPEAKER_03, I'm a little to no because there's no way that you're going to be able to make it no.
1177.66,1178.66,, Okay.
1178.66,1196.66,SPEAKER_02," And we also need to determine the specific functions of this, just to get it all out on paper."
1196.66,1203.66,SPEAKER_02," So we said it needs to send messages to the TV, needs to change the channel, turn on and off."
1203.66,1205.66,SPEAKER_02, Just basic simple stuff like this.
1205.66,1210.66,SPEAKER_02," Look if you have something, just say it and why it's my mean minutes."
1210.66,1213.66,SPEAKER_00, Close channel.
1213.66,1216.66,SPEAKER_00, On off button volume volume.
1216.66,1217.66,SPEAKER_00, Me and channel.
1217.66,1218.66,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1218.66,1220.66,SPEAKER_01, Those are most important ones.
1220.66,1221.66,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1221.66,1225.66,SPEAKER_02," And we want to keep, I'll make a note here that we want to keep the number of buttons down."
1225.66,1226.66,SPEAKER_02, Correct?
1226.66,1227.66,SPEAKER_02, Because people need 10%.
1227.66,1228.66,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1228.66,1229.66,, Okay.
1229.66,1230.66,, Okay.
1230.66,1231.66,, Okay.
1231.66,1232.66,, Good.
1232.66,1233.66,SPEAKER_04, Good.
1233.66,1234.66,SPEAKER_04, Okay.
1234.66,1235.66,, Good.
1235.66,1236.66,, Good.
1236.66,1237.66,, Okay.
1237.66,1238.66,, Good.
1238.66,1239.66,, Okay.
1239.66,1240.66,, Good.
1240.66,1241.66,, Okay.
1241.66,1242.66,SPEAKER_03, Good.
1242.66,1249.66,SPEAKER_03," Um, do we want this thing to be able to be found easily?"
1249.66,1250.66,SPEAKER_03, I think so.
1250.66,1251.66,SPEAKER_03, What are you?
1251.66,1252.66,, Sure.
1252.66,1253.66,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1253.66,1254.66,SPEAKER_01," Sorry, but."
1254.66,1255.66,SPEAKER_01," Uh, finding."
1255.66,1256.66,SPEAKER_01," I mean, we need a like, holding the box."
1256.66,1257.66,SPEAKER_01," Like, holding the box."
1257.66,1258.66,SPEAKER_03, I'm not thinking.
1258.66,1259.66,SPEAKER_03, What are you going to do?
1259.66,1266.66,SPEAKER_03, How are we going to accommodate the quick ability to finding?
1266.66,1271.66,SPEAKER_01," Because people really are looking for a more, that's more high tech."
1271.66,1282.38,SPEAKER_03," What if we gave it a charger and on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and you gotta leave your phone somewhere, you push the button to find it."
1282.38,1283.38,SPEAKER_03, It finds.
1283.38,1287.14,SPEAKER_03, Do you think people really go for that though?
1287.14,1289.14,SPEAKER_03, It's useful for the remote phone.
1289.14,1290.14,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1290.14,1293.14,SPEAKER_02," When that add to our cost, I wonder."
1293.14,1295.14,SPEAKER_01, I would think so because you'd have to develop a base.
1295.14,1296.14,SPEAKER_01, Right.
1296.14,1300.14,SPEAKER_00," Well, if you have a base, you can start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery."
1300.14,1301.14,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1301.14,1302.14,, Hmm.
1302.14,1306.14,SPEAKER_03, Rechargeable battery is a cheaper machine.
1306.14,1307.14,SPEAKER_03, Yeah.
1307.14,1308.14,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1308.14,1310.14,SPEAKER_02, I think we can make a decision about that later.
1310.14,1313.14,SPEAKER_02, We'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss.
1313.14,1319.38,SPEAKER_02," So that would include battery source, power source rather."
1319.38,1324.8200000000002,SPEAKER_02, Is it going to have a charger or is it going to be run strictly after batteries?
1324.8200000000002,1330.3400000000001,SPEAKER_02, And we asked the need to deal with the issue that you mentioned of speech recognition if you want.
1330.3400000000001,1337.8200000000002,SPEAKER_00, Do we have a speech recognition that we can start aiming at like another kind of more handicapped?
1337.8200000000002,1339.8600000000001,SPEAKER_00, Disabled demographic?
1340.86,1344.86,SPEAKER_01," Well, there's the people who desire speech recognition."
1344.86,1348.86,SPEAKER_01, There's the different demographics have different desires.
1348.86,1350.86,SPEAKER_01, I don't know if you guys can.
1350.86,1351.86,SPEAKER_02, You could.
1351.86,1360.86,SPEAKER_01," It wouldn't copy onto the the things it's black, but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition."
1360.86,1364.86,SPEAKER_01, So basically older people don't really care.
1364.86,1367.86,SPEAKER_01, It's really the people 25 to 35.
1367.86,1370.86,SPEAKER_01, I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though.
1370.86,1375.86,SPEAKER_01, The ones I get addicted to soap operas and sitcoms and stuff.
1375.86,1379.86,SPEAKER_02," If we introduce it when they're this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote"
1379.86,1387.86,SPEAKER_00," that has. So then do you put voice recognition, do you put the like a receiver on the actual television in the base or in the actual mode?"
1387.86,1391.86,SPEAKER_00, Because then you've already got the motor and then hand while you're just going to speak to remote.
1391.86,1392.86,SPEAKER_00, Right.
1392.86,1397.86,SPEAKER_00, Whereas if you just speak and done on you don't have to have the remote in your hand like to talk about it.
1397.86,1398.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1398.86,1402.86,SPEAKER_02, And the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too.
1402.86,1403.86,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1403.86,1406.86,SPEAKER_02," We say find remote, locate remote or something."
1406.86,1410.86,SPEAKER_02, That certain phrase that it could be.
1410.86,1412.86,SPEAKER_02, Just throwing it out there.
1412.86,1417.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1417.86,1422.86,SPEAKER_00, Well.
1422.86,1426.86,SPEAKER_00, I'm going to give you 15 minutes.
1426.86,1427.86,, Okay.
1427.86,1429.86,SPEAKER_02, Anything else you want to discuss?
1429.86,1434.86,SPEAKER_00," Well, do we want to include the numbers like 0 through 9?"
1434.86,1437.86,SPEAKER_00, Can we conceive of leaving them out?
1437.86,1438.86,SPEAKER_01, Wait.
1438.86,1439.86,SPEAKER_01, On the remote at tell?
1439.86,1440.86,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1440.86,1442.86,SPEAKER_00," Like you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0."
1442.86,1444.86,SPEAKER_01," Well, we definitely need to help you out."
1444.86,1445.86,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1445.86,1446.86,SPEAKER_00," Well, I don't know."
1446.86,1449.86,SPEAKER_00," I mean, if you can think of it's like, well, I don't know."
1449.86,1451.86,SPEAKER_00, This is the way of leaving them out.
1451.86,1453.86,SPEAKER_03, I think people would find that too foreign.
1453.86,1454.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1454.86,1455.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1455.86,1456.86,SPEAKER_02, That's true.
1456.86,1457.86,SPEAKER_02, Definitely.
1457.86,1460.86,SPEAKER_02, Also remember that in this day of age we need like 100 button too.
1460.86,1464.86,SPEAKER_02, I used to have remote that's not even go up past like 50.
1464.86,1469.86,SPEAKER_02, So I can whenever I got cable I had to get me to meet.
1469.86,1472.86,SPEAKER_02, That's when you get to the sideline.
1472.86,1473.86,SPEAKER_02," Yes, I can."
1473.86,1474.86,SPEAKER_02, Or digital cable.
1474.86,1475.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1475.86,1476.86,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1476.86,1484.86,SPEAKER_02, I guess we're going to discuss the project financing later.
1484.86,1493.86,SPEAKER_02, Making sure that we can fit all the stuff that we want to on our budget.
1493.86,1497.86,SPEAKER_03," Yeah, because I don't have any material parsing information available to me at the moment."
1497.86,1503.86,SPEAKER_02, So don't forget we need to include the color of our company and the logo.
1503.86,1505.86,SPEAKER_02, The color being yellow.
1505.86,1507.86,SPEAKER_02, I'm guessing.
1507.86,1508.86,SPEAKER_02, How do you like it?
1508.86,1509.86,SPEAKER_01, I feel yellow.
1509.86,1510.86,SPEAKER_01, I feel yellow.
1510.86,1511.86,SPEAKER_01, I'm going to be too garish.
1511.86,1512.86,SPEAKER_01, We could just have to make it a little bit.
1512.86,1513.86,SPEAKER_02, I don't know.
1513.86,1515.86,SPEAKER_02, Or maybe yellow light for the key.
1515.86,1516.86,SPEAKER_01, I'll put like stripes.
1516.86,1517.86,SPEAKER_01," Oh, yeah, yellow."
1517.86,1518.86,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1518.86,1521.86,SPEAKER_03, Yellow could be and it doesn't have to be huge.
1521.86,1522.86,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1522.86,1525.86,SPEAKER_00," Well, if you have like a, I know."
1525.86,1528.86,SPEAKER_00, You have the sort of strip kind of down at the bottom.
1528.86,1531.86,SPEAKER_00, The base of it is just like yellow with the R.
1531.86,1532.86,SPEAKER_04, Right.
1532.86,1541.86,SPEAKER_02," So we've simplified, we don't need all those play fast forward in mind."
1541.86,1542.86,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1542.86,1543.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1543.86,1544.86,SPEAKER_02," You know, many buttons."
1544.86,1555.86,SPEAKER_02, So we've pretty much paired it down to on off volume mute channel up down on the numbers.
1555.86,1558.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1558.86,1567.86,SPEAKER_02," Can we go back to, I'm going to look really quickly back at those two examples."
1567.86,1568.86,SPEAKER_02, Examples.
1568.86,1569.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1569.86,1571.86,SPEAKER_02, Let's see if there's anything which one was your technical functions.
1571.86,1572.86,SPEAKER_02," Oh, so yeah."
1572.86,1573.86,SPEAKER_02, Yeah.
1573.86,1574.86,SPEAKER_01, Yeah.
1574.86,1576.86,SPEAKER_01, Audio settings and screen settings.
1576.86,1582.86,SPEAKER_01," We need those like audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness color."
1582.86,1585.86,SPEAKER_01, Or do we just want that access access from the television itself?
1585.86,1586.86,SPEAKER_02, I think that that's fine.
1586.86,1587.86,SPEAKER_02, Just in the TV.
1587.86,1591.86,SPEAKER_02," I mean, how often does they have a GZ to get that kind of stuff?"
1591.86,1596.86,SPEAKER_00," Well, the other ops is sort of like down at the bottom like farther away."
1596.86,1600.86,SPEAKER_00, You just have the sort of box in that where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much.
1600.86,1602.86,SPEAKER_00, But occasionally you will use.
1602.86,1603.86,SPEAKER_00," Yeah, because we did."
1603.86,1610.86,SPEAKER_01, We definitely need to have buttons for like sub titles and things like that is because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff.
1610.86,1614.86,SPEAKER_01," And like on television, like I know, living in Los Angeles."
1614.86,1617.86,SPEAKER_01, It's tons of Spanish network television.
1617.86,1620.86,SPEAKER_01," If it has English subtitles, it's definitely helpful."
1620.86,1622.86,SPEAKER_02, Can we do that off here with a button?
1622.86,1623.86,SPEAKER_02, I don't know if it will.
1623.86,1629.86,SPEAKER_02," I'm any button that pops up with a menu on TV that says, you know, audio, video, whatever, language, you know."
1629.86,1630.86,SPEAKER_02, Right.
1630.86,1632.86,SPEAKER_01, So we need up down inside the side buttons.
1632.86,1633.86,SPEAKER_01," Well, that would be a minute."
1633.86,1637.86,SPEAKER_00, We could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.
1637.86,1638.86,SPEAKER_00, That's true.
1638.86,1639.86,SPEAKER_00, Yeah.
1639.86,1641.86,SPEAKER_00, The channel is just up and down.
1641.86,1642.86,SPEAKER_01, Okay.
1642.86,1649.86,SPEAKER_00," And then something that such as, yeah, the one, you know, going over there on the left, the"
1649.86,1650.86,SPEAKER_01, engineering center.
1650.86,1651.86,SPEAKER_04, Right.
1651.86,1658.86,SPEAKER_00," Right. So we just have like add a menu button then for the various things needed, including voice recognition."
1658.86,1664.86,SPEAKER_00," If we have any like settings for voice recognition though, included in the menu."
1664.86,1665.86,SPEAKER_01, Yep.
1665.86,1672.86,SPEAKER_01, We just got an idea for just how I'm good.
1672.86,1683.86,SPEAKER_02, Anybody have anything else I'd like to bring up?
1683.86,1684.86,SPEAKER_02, You just need it.
1684.86,1687.86,SPEAKER_03, I had something but I forgot.
1687.86,1688.86,, Okay.
1688.86,1689.86,, Okay.
1689.86,1690.86,, Here.
1690.86,1697.86,SPEAKER_02, Let's go back to the main closure then and see what we need to do next.
1697.86,1704.86,SPEAKER_02, All right.
1704.86,1711.86,SPEAKER_02," After this meeting, we're going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again, which we need to apply to that email."
1711.86,1712.86,SPEAKER_02, And then we're going to have lunch break.
1712.86,1716.86,SPEAKER_02," And after lunch, 30 minutes of individual work time."
1716.86,1717.86,SPEAKER_02, I'm going to put the minutes.
1717.86,1722.86,SPEAKER_02, I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the product documents folder if you'd like to review them.
1722.86,1726.86,SPEAKER_02, And I'm going to type up the minutes for this one as well.
1726.86,1728.86,SPEAKER_02, Here's what we're each going to do.
1728.86,1732.86,SPEAKER_02, The ID is going to work on the components concept.
1732.86,1737.86,SPEAKER_02," UID, the user interface concept and you're going to do some turn-watching."
1737.86,1738.86,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1738.86,1742.86,SPEAKER_02, Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.
1742.86,1746.86,SPEAKER_02," And if anybody has anything they would like to add, no?"
1746.86,1747.86,SPEAKER_02, Okay.
1747.86,1750.86,SPEAKER_02," Well, this meeting is officially over."
1750.86,1751.86,SPEAKER_02, Thank you all.
