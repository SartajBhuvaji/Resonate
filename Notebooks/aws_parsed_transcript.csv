spk_0,0.00015,1.1903166666666667,"I can record and we dont have a ton of items to get to, uh and I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time. Um So corporate events, uh they, I think I saw a little, I put this in, in slack and I saw a little bit of uh kind of noise around it, which was good. Um You know, the, the nutshell here is as weve kind of restructured and tried different things. Um The event support that we need isnt as nailed down as it needs to be. Uh So the current tactic that were going with is go to market team signs up and kind of s sponsors that event. So you support as a PM M, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Uh I dont see anyone in the uh maybe there are comments in the issue. I dont see the, the header updated yet."
spk_1,1.2034833333333332,1.2651666666666666,I thought we had in Slack sort of farmed each one of them out.
spk_0,1.2776666666666667,1.9018333333333333,"Thats so I guess that the next, so it looks like Thai put in some folks it looks like this looks good. So that, lets see, need support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would be, um, to work with your GTM team. So, so did, let me ask it, I saw some slack, I think in our Slack. But did, did you all, uh, were you all able to connect with like your GTM teams,"
spk_2,1.9473166666666664,2.00765,"uh, on Slack only and on the issue actually?"
spk_3,2.014333333333333,2.2703333333333333,"Yeah, same, not in, not in real time, but, you know, source feedback. I got one person to respond so far. So it may end up Cindy being you and I just picking the one that we want to do and then they can back and set up um If we dont get any more feedback."
spk_0,2.3095,2.4448333333333334,"Yeah. Do you all um Does anybody have like a, a regular sink still? Are those all been canceled or is there"
spk_4,2.48,2.5098166666666666,in case you still have a regular sick?
spk_5,2.5225,2.5605," Yeah, were on like a two week
 cadence."
spk_0,2.5646666666666667,2.57315,Ok.
spk_2,2.5829833333333334,2.6615,"Yeah, GS has been canceled um after the enablement."
spk_0,2.70465,2.9983166666666667,Cool. So Im just trying to catch up with the thread. Um So it looks like maybe a platform on re invent C I CD on Google next and gets on coupon. Does that sound right?
spk_3,3.0254833333333333,3.05065,Thats where we were last I heard.
spk_0,3.0668166666666665,4.012833333333333,"Cool. So then I think, um I think we can, we can help the Corp events team. They do, they do a lot of like a cat herding and, you know, keep on tracking people down. So I think if, if this team can take the mission to, like, try to help track that down. So, if you, you know, get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, like were, were signing up for a coupon, you know, can you comment on the issue that yes, I can commit to this, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you know. Um So that just so that they can get that, that event support, but that looks good. And I appreciate uh thanks for the link too, Sonia on the roles ah product announcements. So I appreciate you Brian for adding this. I uh I probably should have added it, but"
spk_1,4.039483333333333,4.137333333333333,I had two questions about that. 11 is over. What time frame are we looking at?
spk_0,4.159816666666667,5.810316666666667,"So, uh so in theory, this is this could be the same as the Gab 14 launch where were saying basically since 13.0 what has, you know, what kind of big improvements have we made? Um Candidly, this is always a little bit tough and Im and Im, I am not totally sure of all of the kind of the interplay here, but I think I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment is OK, we have commit coming up. We have some amount of like we have a stage of, you know, a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and well get some amount of press attention because were having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make? Um at git lab, its really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire roadmap is completely public, yada yada yada. So the thought here is to, but also because our entire road map is completely public and because we ship these tiny little NBC S and a new feature will come out, but itll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say, OK, like what started in the last year, but now is really like a full fledged feature. What would, what would be coming out of beta, right? Like if we were any other company, when we started a beta program in this last year, what would we be announcing is G A at commit? Thats kind of, thats kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of head. Nos. What do you think, Sydney?"
spk_1,5.837816666666667,6.326483333333333,"Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say like vulnerability management because there were tiny little MV CS all the way along. But if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this, it makes more sense to me to highlight that than in any individual little thing. And then the other point was we just had 14.0 can we just, can we reuse some of those things and plug them in here."
spk_0,6.32965,6.708816666666666,"Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And vulnerability management was, was one of the, you know, the features out of we, we looked at 14.0. So I think, yeah, this is like, lets take the stuff from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or give, give our pr team. This is kind of like input into our pr team to give them fodder to go out with."
spk_1,6.7149833333333335,6.754983333333334,And are we trying to hit three per stage?
spk_0,6.766483333333333,7.143483333333333,"I, yeah, ideally, theres just, you know, three, you know, uh three items per stage. And then I think yall made some good notes that OK, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here. Thats excellent. Um And uh integrations we dont, well, actually we have some pretty exciting integration. So we have the,  the Jira stuff
 is pretty good."
spk_5,7.14365,9.009833333333331,"Theres a couple of things in uh integrations with VS code that could be notable, but I can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it. And if someone hasnt done it, maybe thatll also kick I was going Cindys direction here, which was uh thinking, you know, a lot of, and then I call them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations, but I called them something overall. So we would have like one thing to call them. Uh Theres several key iterations aligned with uh giddily cluster, uh several that roll up to a research based user experience. And I was thinking like I, I was shy and calling out UX as, as a bucket except that actually thats, thats super typical, right? Like Windows 11 or anybody whos rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things and then they mentioned a laundry list of stuff that aligns to that. Um So I, I, you know, forgave myself, uh for doing something. At first, I was kind of like shy about calling out UX and, and bucketing some things there. But actually, when I looked around, thats pretty much how everybody does, um, a big launch and in terms of the excitement level that also, like I went in thinking this is just a two, I guess part of it is like, I feel like were almost fixing something thats broken and thats not something you want to shout from the rooftops about, but actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level. I wasnt sure exactly where to place things. Um But I figured I wouldnt, uh like the Cindys comment have something thats one here anyway. But I, the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to, to bucket them with something. And, uh, so thats kind of how I came down on it. I dont know what everyone thinks about that."
spk_4,9.073483333333334,9.097816666666668,"Yeah. II, I like that."
spk_2,9.130666666666666,9.511666666666668,"I know Ive done a similar, Ive taken a similar approach for monitor. Um, with incident management, there were a bunch of things that we released. Um, although the core of incident management was part of 12 dot X. I think so. Um I did the same over there as well. Yeah,  I think that makes
 sense."
spk_4,9.516483333333332,10.264316666666666,"Yeah. And that, that would help me with the planned stuff as well because there are some things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they finally have and thats great. But um I think, you know, like the the milestone burn up charts that that was a two and thats, thats helpful and I was looking through features and you know, a actual monthly features that were released in a given month. I mean, that was one of the more important ones, but its not very exciting, but we can bundle that with some other things and, and, and up level it so that that would be helpful there. And also Brian about the VS code thing. One other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month were um community contributions, which is also kind of cool"
spk_0,10.29765,10.367,"is, is that, is, do we have VS code listed on here?"
spk_5,10.397,10.5865,"I didnt add it but I can, I can add that in. Ive got good notes on that. The extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of the things,  but theres some other stuff thats a little juicier
 than that"
spk_0,10.636833333333334,11.028983333333333,"and that, I think thats a, thats a pretty good note as well. Um We did that with like our, our terraform module right. There was like a community module but now its officially supported. So thats, thats the, you know, that can be the line, yes or no, whether you can use the thing uh for a lot of businesses. So I think thats a good one too."
spk_2,11.037316666666667,11.607333333333331,"How are we measuring excitement levels? 12 and three is there? I was, I was looking at um maybe MA U as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. Uh We probably may not have it for everything, but at least some of it wherever we have it is it, its probably something we can, we can use. Yeah, but we, of course, we need a benchmark level of what MA U we wanna call. 12 or three."
spk_0,11.625,12.654983333333334,"I, I think its a little, its a little bit of a judgment call like um you know, for example, Cormac was saying, uh like Epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time. Now, depending on how its asked for, maybe that means its exciting or its not, right? Um But uh usually when something gets a lot of upvotes or when theres a lot of demand for it, then I would, I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Um, certainly if something shipped and a lot of people are using it, the MA U, thats a, thats another good measure. I dont know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive. I think its a bit of a, its a bit of an individual judgment column just like what is, what is your feeling based on, you know, could be anecdotal like you talk to customers and theyre like really hyper excited about this or, you know, maybe not, which is, which is OK. I think its OK. Um"
spk_1,12.66765,12.814666666666668,Harsh responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about ha having him sort of stack ranked.
spk_0,12.840483333333331,13.64665,"Yeah, I might, I might even constrain this is were not going to highlight lo segments, but we want to see the full spectrum, especially in the case we have slim pickings alternately uh if they are double digit entries, then we can stack rank. Um So thats, thats kind of also helpful there. So if we have three for all of these that, I mean, it looks like were gonna get there and thats gonna be quite a lot of features. So um I might constrain it like this. Maybe you can only give out 112 or three and, and, and treated as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level. That doesnt necessarily"
spk_1,13.651983333333334,13.789,hard to somebodys one or somebodys 3 may be more important than somebody elses one depending on the
spk_5,13.80065,14.07,"and I had um I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year uh from, from create and, you know, there are at least a dozen things that Im not mentioning. Uh that could be on the list. Like I could give you 10 things instead of three,"
spk_0,14.078816666666668,14.7355,"give it, give this just like the rough like pass and um like a lot of things recently, Ive been moving between docs and spreadsheets and the spreadsheet to docs. Uh This, you know, this might, this might end up or some iteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in pr is like, OK, out of all of like the, you know, theres maybe 10 boxes here and three each out of the 30 items which are the top five. Um Actually, lets just, lets actually just do that, lets just do this like top, top five overall.  We, so this
 one is apr driven to some degree."
spk_5,14.735666666666669,14.833333333333334,"What about like a New and Christies uh product keynote at commit?  Are we that tailing this with
 that?"
spk_0,14.837316666666666,15.731816666666669,"So, so this is exactly where this is headed to um is the idea that um during the product keynote and then ideally during Kid Sids keynote as well that theres some level of like an announcement that we make that. Then the press cares about that announcement. Um Again, really tough to do at cl because its all been around for a while. So this is this is our attempt to head to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event and yeah, maybe its some things that have been around for a while, but like now theyre at a level of maturity now, you know, theres, theres a reason to be excited about this. So thats kind of where its coming from. So I put uh a top five overall. Maybe we can just, uh you know,"
spk_4,15.819833333333332,15.983983333333333,"we should reserve a spot for plan, but Im gonna have to go through and do some aggregating after this. Just go through the list of what shift in the last 12 months and re bucket that."
spk_0,16.025,16.402333333333335,"So, uh maybe we can do like a five minutes kind of like um just, just time box and uh kind of look at these here. What do you, what do you all think is a top would be a top five out of the list of, you know, 20 or 30."
spk_5,16.448,16.641,"I would say if UX does end up being a, a flag that we fly, thats an easy one because theres more than just maps to the created stage that would be considered UX improvement. OK."
spk_1,16.779983333333334,17.238166666666668,"What else we need to have a security one in there. We could have either vulnerability management or, um, I was, what Ive been struggling with a little bit is Id like to kind of group the, um, some of this, the proprietary scanning, um, without making it sound like theyre scanning improvements because that sounds like they werent good before."
spk_0,17.250166666666665,17.522316666666665,"Yeah, I, lets, lets go with vulnerability management for now. II, I would agree on that one and I would say that um some of these, we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing. So we might not get that"
spk_1,17.529333333333334,17.642666666666667,"old. I was, I mean, we did the fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago."
spk_0,17.667666666666666,17.803816666666666,"Was it within the past year for longer? I thought it was  within the past year. I
 think it was in the last"
spk_2,17.808833333333332,17.839666666666666,"six, little over six months or"
spk_3,17.841483333333333,17.924483333333335,"so. It was,  it was
 like last spring or summer and then we"
spk_1,17.92465,18.211983333333333,"did another set of press around the integration of it because the pr team liked all the, I mean, we got a lot of attention on the acquisition. So they had me do a follow up um on the integration.  I just feel like its kind of worn out
 now, but"
spk_0,18.219816666666667,18.357316666666662,"right, thats what I was saying is that the, the fuzzing we already did press on so probably will not get another chomp at that. So I think lets go with Vulnerability management"
spk_3,18.37265,18.40683333333333,"UN review, but we also have"
spk_1,18.416666666666668,18.93583333333333,"in terms of proprietary stuff. Weve also got, we replaced one of our scanners with SEM group and we did um we have our own proprietary DAS scanner now thats in, its in beta uh called browser. So its our answer to scanning single page applications which represent a unique challenge. I think. I mean, if I could have to, it would be vulnerability management and berserker probably."
spk_0,18.94715,18.967166666666667,OK. Sere
spk_5,18.973333333333333,19.04498333333333,"did get picked up as a line item and a couple of the pieces about get back 14,"
spk_0,19.136983333333333,19.254666666666665,"which uh between between the, the proprietary shifts of the vulnerability management, which would you pick as the number one out of those two?"
spk_1,19.286,19.314833333333333,Probably vulnerability management?
spk_0,19.322816666666668,19.60565,OK. Im just kind of scanning the list. I would probably say like Cooper Nets agent is something that weve made a lot of investment in. Although um I
spk_2,19.613166666666668,19.878316666666667,"think the CIN agent and uh from an integration point of view, uh perhaps the terra farm integration, I think we have a, a lot of customers actually using that already. So I, I"
spk_0,19.901816666666665,20.724316666666667,"Im just gonna call those get ops and Im gonna put like KS agents plus has she for integrations? Its like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about. Uh I Yep, cool. Well, lets, you know, lets try to uh this is due Tuesday. I think we wanna try to get this done. Um So maybe just uh review this kind of like lets just kind of pick top five maybe something from plant something from C I CD.  Uh pipeline
 editor is definitely an option for C I CD."
spk_3,20.732983333333333,20.742816666666663,Um
spk_4,20.76215,20.78065,"Yeah, and there might be a"
spk_3,20.801816666666667,20.8065,"sorry,"
spk_4,20.8135,21.050666666666668,"no, sorry. There, there might be a value stream analytics story in there too. Um If we aggregate it all, its, its a bummer that customizable value stream analytics is 12 dot night. Um But uh yeah, yeah, there might be"
spk_0,21.1005,21.349316666666667,"cool. Im just gonna, Im gonna ping you on this cormac to add, add a, a top five plan. Cool. Uh I think"
spk_3,21.376316666666668,21.46815,"thats a pretty heavy, pretty heavy list just looking at it, you know, its pretty cool. Yeah, thats great."
spk_0,21.49898333333333,22.365166666666667,"Yeah, and this is something we dont do, which II I agree. Like we dont, we dont often stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins. Uh I was really, I dont, did yall, did anybody miss uh what do we call it assembly, the assembly? Um If you missed it, I recommend it. I laughed because like what assembly reminds me of is like when I was in like a young child in grade school, you, theyd have this big stack of like carpet, they were like squares of carpet and you go, like you go into the gym and you pull off a square of carpet and all the Children would sit on a square of carpet and that was like youd have an assembly so  that
 to put everyone in the gym or like convert the half cafeteria gym,"
spk_3,22.367816666666663,22.5275,"you know, take away the big barrier between it so that we can have more room and then take those carpets that have never been cleaned and just, you know, sit on them and itll be, itll be great."
spk_0,22.53383333333333,23.00565,"Aside, aside from the goofy name, I thought that, um, and of course we cant talk about any of it on youtube. But man, that was like a really awesome look back at like heres some wins and heres some exciting things that weve done. Um And so I think we just need to get better at this as a company. I think this exercise is an opportunity that um I think we do a little bit of that, but this is doing it more. So, uh Sonia, you have some questions here for elitists."
spk_2,23.04748333333333,24.150666666666663,"So, in the competitive sheet, I was, I mean, Ive already identified the features for CD configure as well as uh monitor. Uh getting it reviewed from PM. My guess was, or my understanding was that we wouldnt have the same set of competitors that they gonna compare to, but the right competitors for that particular stage, right? So for example, for uh for monitor, uh we may not have like a github or something like that, we would have monitor based competitors or was that the understanding because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage? I thought we were gonna be using those competitors to compare against. So I just wanted your, your input on whats because I saw uh some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there. Um So they may not be relevant, for example, Cloud be may not be relevant for monitor stage at all. Um So thats what I wanted to check with you."
spk_6,24.155,24.43048333333333,"Yeah, thats the case. I, I need to go back and look at the spreadsheet. I mean, if the competitor does not apply to that particular stage, they shouldnt be on that tab in the spreadsheet. So are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they dont apply? Yeah, I"
spk_3,24.4335,24.4425,think it was copy
spk_2,24.44565,24.82958333333333,"pasted. Each has the same. Yeah. So each sheet has uh has uh ad O Atlassian Guitar Jenkins, J Frog and cloud piece, right? So that may not be relevant for monitor for configure. It would be a different set of comp competitors that we need to include, which I think we already identified a while back. I think we identified top three competitors for every stage."
spk_6,24.839066666666668,25.1135,"We, thats when we tiered them, right? Tier one, tier two, tier three. So this where we are right now is were looking at just tier one competitors. Thats probably why I cut and paste them because those are all tier ones. So were just focusing on tier one right now. So if they dont apply to that stage, dont worry about it makes sense."
spk_3,25.125333333333334,25.175166666666662,"So, just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage."
spk_2,25.183666666666667,25.613816666666665,"Right. So we just use the tier one computers and if theyre not, if they dont, are not applicable, then we dont have to fill out anything for that.  Yeah,
 for now. But then well move to tier two and tier three, then well look at those and do we need to add a line item for get lab as well? Because I, I think thats the thing over here.  Yeah, we
 should add up. I think you asked me that"
spk_6,25.615816666666667,25.69115,"before. Right.  Or someone asked me,
 Im just looking at it, Brian"
spk_1,25.698666666666668,25.842166666666667,"asked because the way without it, youre basically putting all the things that were better at."
spk_6,25.850666666666665,25.892166666666668,"Yeah, for sure, for sure. Yeah."
spk_0,25.92933333333333,26.07465,"Ideally when we pick like the 10 to 15 features, those, some of those were like git lab only, some of those were like git lab didnt have,"
spk_3,26.097316666666668,26.175833333333333,"well, I thought it was supposed to be not, none of them should be get level only. Right. It should be all through the lens of."
spk_0,26.187316666666668,27.040816666666668,"Exactly. Yeah, it should be like market lens. So in an ideal world, most of them are like this is what Im shopping for this solution. Some, like some of them might be get level only. Some of them might be like competitor only so that its a, somebody would look at it and be like, this looks honest and trustworthy and like a, a accurate assessment of the market. And then, yeah, I think Sonia for this just to kind of reiterate for this one. Were only doing these five competitors. So well do the other ones in a later stage. And then uh for if, if the vendor builds like bills themselves as a platform, then we should specifically call out that they have zero. So github Bills itself as a platform, it sells itself that way. Um Same with as your Dev ops. Same with Jay Frog."
spk_6,27.047816666666662,27.091666666666665,"Well, they all do for tier one except Jenkins and Clovis"
spk_0,27.11231666666667,27.351816666666668,"Jenkins. Cloys does not. But what is it? You know, as your dep you have uh Atlassian and although Atlassian, we still need to figure something out there.  As a
 matter of fact, then I go back and add"
spk_6,27.35365,27.4775,"Atlassian because I based on conversation, I think we have to do it. I dont think we can leave them off. So then I, I dont, I have to look at this."
spk_2,27.48433333333333,27.5355,"It is Atlassian  is on that sheet.
 Ok."
spk_6,27.536483333333333,27.697816666666668,"Yeah, I went back and added them because based on discussion like my, my, I wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner, but we cant do that. So,"
spk_0,27.716316666666668,27.963,"so, so yeah, so for, for those platform, you know, we should call out the fact that they dont have any monitoring. If they have like zero out of 15, we should call that out. Um Same with configure stuff for this, you know, any those kind of capabilities,"
spk_3,28.00565,28.230166666666666,"it be, it be, I think if we took that a step further, itd be good to even describe it in a way that doesnt just say our product stage and use like a value based description of what monitor and configure mean because otherwise were just, no, thats not gonna do any good for us."
spk_6,28.2385,28.483833333333333,"Have you guys seen the new infographic that the uh design team has come up with? Not yet. Oh You havent. No. Do we have a link to that quickly? William?  I dont
 know or we can throw it in the uh you can throw it in the um notes if you find it."
spk_0,28.499316666666665,28.552666666666667,Uh Lets see who can find it faster.
spk_3,28.569983333333333,28.61815,I guarantee you not with the amount of tabs I have open.
spk_6,28.631666666666668,28.76483333333333,"Oh my God. Thats why Im like, it probably wont be me. So I this is why I send everything to uh Google"
spk_0,28.772483333333334,28.97065,uh gmail because the search is so fast. So I literally have a folder where all of my get lab pings go and I can just search for infographic and I
spk_6,28.973333333333333,28.996,found it. I found it. I found it.
spk_0,29.001483333333333,29.0255,Who could look at first?
spk_6,29.053,29.368316666666665,"I found it. I found it. So this is the one. So this, theres two, this is the one for the single to comparison but then for the um but its gonna look the same but then heres the one for um I just put it in chat for you guys and heres the one for the platform players."
spk_0,29.39033333333333,30.2005,"So, so we made a, we made a couple of decisions along the way. So um one of the decisions was to just go with stages. Um It, it, it would have been like a whole another layer of OK, if we dont go with just the git lab stages, the 10 stages, what do, what do we use? um that has to be determined, reconciled all this kind of stuff like the, you know, we kinda, I dont know how long its been since we updated, those pages have like not been updated, but we kind of are just trying to move towards some sort towards some progress. So uh I concur that maybe configure and monitor is not as descriptive as it could be but the place where it will. So actually, Ill, Ill share one thing,"
spk_3,30.210833333333333,30.25483333333333,"it  just seems like the right time to do this,
 right?"
spk_4,30.257483333333333,30.3085,"Manage is, is even less descriptive than that."
spk_0,30.325,31.103816666666667,"So, so um the way this is the way this is getting built is off of a data model. So um in theory, these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same, right? Because like were, were separating like like presentation layer from data layer. Uh So thats, its not gonna be as hard to update in the future as it currently is where its a mess of spaghetti code and its like really, really difficult to update. And then the other component is then not in this iteration, we need to get something live. But in the next iteration youll click on verify and itll go down to the list of the 15 features and thats where you can describe what the heck of verify is  or what the heck I
 manage."
spk_3,31.11133333333333,31.327666666666666,"So we will have an opportunity because I was about to say youre gonna hate me for this. But like were, were being cyclical about the same problem we had there being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages. Thats a problem."
spk_6,31.334816666666665,31.73515,"That was one of the big things. Its like, OK, 1515 features. What, what is, what are they? Why do I care? You know? Yeah, that means to say that means nothing to me looking at this, this page. Um But quick question. No, were on top of it actually, if you read the thread I brought that up, but she said we cant do it like right now, which I understand but small thing, what do you guys think about the colors?"
spk_3,31.761816666666668,31.838166666666663,"Uh I dont know. I usually let the designers handle that stuff. They, they,"
spk_4,31.84315,31.97465,"I, I like, I, I like the fact that theres no red on there."
spk_6,31.985666666666667,32.02415,"Oh You like that? Thats what I was going  for you.
 Like"
spk_4,32.03081666666667,32.529833333333336,"its not, its not obviously negative. Uh So were saying because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because theres no, you know, these folks at 37% are in the red and theyre terrible. They just have less green or we would have less green. So its, its not, its not being worse, its being less good. And I think that, I, I think that lends itself to working with, you know, all the co opet situations were talking about, you know."
spk_0,32.54898333333333,32.83465,"Yeah, thats, thats the goal is we want, we want to generate a helpful asset for the industry. This is not just like marketing chill, this should be like a helpful page. Uh So its like, yeah, the goal is to have a comparison comparing DEV ops tool is not a, you know, this is all of our competitors and why were better."
spk_6,32.842333333333336,33.19883333333333,"Yeah. Um iiii I think from a competitive mindset and for me, Im like, lets go hard, lets put some red on there and thats just the way I think, right. So, but I brought it up and that for now were gonna stick with the green. They recommend that we stick with the green and uh see how it goes. But I dont know,  I was feeling the red and yellow too
 so it is easy on the eyes and um its, you know,"
spk_3,33.19898333333333,33.24816666666667,"theres something to be said for that. So, yeah,"
spk_0,33.25866666666667,34.96465,"uh cool. Well, were almost up on time but I did wanna share one thing that kind of came in like basically Friday, it was like late Thursday for me. So this uh this is another thing, a lot, a lot of these things, I dont have like a ton of context on. Um I just know like were just trying to up our game. So like, hey, lets move fast and do the best we can do. Um So this is a little bit of a messaging framework and then the assignment that was given to me was to, to fill in these boxes here. So, uh and then this was the fodder that I got. So there was these ones that said like from roadmap to company vision, we are transparent and a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. Honestly, I think this ones really like, really pithy and catchy. Uh I really like it. Um I really liked uh whats the other one that I like? But not everyone does um all in one for everyone. So I just uh I dont know, I like, I just think so theres something catchy about that. Um But I know that kind of catchy is not everyones cup of tea. All that to say is um the assignment here was that I took, it was to write a pithy, few words like punchy statement for each of these three things. Uh So I ended up with a single source of truth. Countless possibilities. I like that a lot. Um This one I went with end to end control over your software factory, not as pithy but or like not as catchy, but um I like it."
spk_1,34.96965,35.05883333333333,"So whats the difference between that slide and the  next one that doesnt have anything under
 security?"
spk_0,35.06033333333333,36.679833333333335,"This, this was the um honestly, so that, so when I first got this, it didnt have this and it didnt have anything under security. So this, this was what I do is just your iteration of it. Yeah, this is, this is mine. This is I just put here so that I would have like the original statements like, you know, automate nearly anything, collaborate on everything. I kind of like that. But I, you know, this one I hate scale up, speed up, test up. I dont think anybody tests up. I think thats really goofy. So you hate it. Uh This one I love that for me. Its I love it or I hate it, right?  Um I
 love, I love how youre just like uh so anyway, the what I love is just in five minutes now and then we can just kind of end the call is kind of like um anything that you would change this out for, anything that you would change this out for. And then actually, lets start here. This one I couldnt pick and Ill, Ill tell you why. Its because I, I like things to have parody in, in their tone, right? So this is maybe like super nuanced elements of messaging but I hate it if its like a single source of truth, thats like a noun phrase. End to end control. Thats like a noun items. So you could say with Git Lab, you get a single source of truth. With Git lab, you get end to end control. And you cant say with Git Lab, you get, move fast with confidence.  No,
 but you can say more speed, less risk. I like that one the best."
spk_1,36.68,36.69915,I dont like the last one.
spk_0,36.7125,36.87448333333333,"I agree. Thats, thats why I put this one at top was for that parody. And then so it sounds like kind of yalls thoughts or thats, thats good as well."
spk_4,36.89333333333333,37.18131666666667,"Uh Yeah, the only thing it might be missing but I dont know how we do it without over complicating. It is. Well, I guess less risk also implies higher quality. I guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together. So I, Ive talked myself out of not liking that. So, yeah. Good."
spk_5,37.20381666666667,37.41833333333334,"Cindys last blog post had a really good turn of phrase that I stole for for give out 14 when she was out, it was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that youre making it.  She said it really elegant
 and"
spk_1,37.42133333333334,37.52633333333333,"so I just deliverables, secure the software factory and its deliverables.  Yeah,
 I thought it was good to emphasize both"
spk_5,37.528983333333336,37.55681666666667,because they mean it was nice.
spk_1,37.60833333333333,37.76733333333333,Yeah. So you could say um secure and control your software factory and its deliverables. Maybe that would encompass both thoughts.
spk_0,37.84583333333333,37.94283333333333,"Im, Im not a big fan of the, its, its deliverables. Is there, uh, can we say like"
spk_4,37.958333333333336,38.047983333333335,"your software factory and your software or your, your software or in your product?"
spk_1,38.06316666666667,38.11716666666667,"Product? Sounds like  car manufacturer.
 I"
spk_3,38.12381666666667,38.20033333333333,"say IP, here, but it just doesnt sound right. And thats always, its always shorthand."
spk_0,38.21165,38.26215,"Yeah, I like this one better."
spk_1,38.317166666666665,38.39815,"Yeah, I think I do too but, but I appreciate the thought, Brian."
spk_0,38.42398333333333,39.9385,"Uh And then the last thing Ill say is so this is, this is my attempt to, to channel my inner Ash withers. Um I think Ash is like super good at just again, just like the the catchier like the turn of phrase element to it. Um And so like this kind of idea like single source of truth, countless possibilities or all in one for everyone. Theres something catchy about this. So, so here I was trying to like envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity? Its like its velocity with confidence is what is what you get? Um  I
 like your move fast with confidence better than increased speed and stay on track. Yeah, so I was trying to, I was thinking of like, you know, if youre like, if youre in a race car and like you go like super, super fast, like lets say youre in the bike race, right? And youre going so fast and somebody holds out the sign and then like half of the bike race collapses, right? Um So its almost kind of like you can, you can keep going like faster and faster and faster. And if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack, youre not gonna get tripped up by it because get labs, you know, its testing is gonna catch that and security is gonna catch that. Um, all of those elements that allow you to move faster, but to do so with confidence because otherwise youre like the faster you go then it gets more dangerous. So trying to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where I was like, stay on track, but I, I didnt like it either. You  just
 open"

spk_0,40.17633333333333,40.34931666666667,"So yeah. So I dont think I like that one and then I think between these two, I like move fast with confidence, but I dont like the, the verbiage of it because it doesnt have parody. So thats where I think."
spk_2,40.35866666666666,40.64398333333333,"Do you wanna add, maybe we can add high confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement. So it kind of combines all of it. So more speed, less risk, high confidence, confidence  is kind
 of overused. Anyway, like I see a lot of competitors and vendors using it."
spk_3,40.64415,40.75516666666667,"I really like the first one just more speed, less risk. Bam no trade offs. You know, just that how it is. Mm"
spk_1,40.766666666666666,40.78816666666667,oh no trade offs.
spk_3,40.81283333333333,40.906983333333336,"Thats one of my go tos I love that one.  This,
 this gets into the uh"
spk_0,40.91565,41.2255,"no trade offs. The en the engineering me says theres never no tradeoffs. Thats like saying like 100% secure. Like this is why we always say mitigate, right? We always say like risk or less risk. You never say no with messaging, right? I mean, not everything, you know,"
spk_3,41.23565,41.28766666666667," not
 just more speed, less risk with confidence."

spk_4,41.41515,41.52633333333333,more speed. The Ricky Bobby and me really did like the no trade offs there. Parker.

 Uh no, but it could have been."

 activities."
