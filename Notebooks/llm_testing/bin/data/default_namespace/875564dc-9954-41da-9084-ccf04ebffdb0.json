    "meeting_summary": "The meeting was about the performance of the D-goal. The team was reminded that they had to be very careful about the quality of their work. The professor thought that they should make sure that their work was up to standard and that they were doing a good job of it. The group also discussed how they could make their work better. The final meeting ended with a group discussion about the future directions of the project, including the future direction of the team and future work on the project."
