SocialMedia,HarmedTeens,What is a common recommendation regarding the age limit for children on social media platforms?,Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.
SocialMedia,HarmedTeens,What was discussed about cyberbullying?,"My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?"
SocialMedia,HarmedTeens,Did they talk about social media and eating disorder?,"you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do."
SocialMedia,HarmedTeens,Does social media make people antisocial?,"Um I sat down here saying that social media makes people antisocial. But hearing Alexa and Alex speak, it makes me remember that um social media isnt just, you know, the whole tiktok scene. Its also schools, theres clubs and stuff. Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near. I do see how social media can be bad, but I, I like to think of it in a positive light."
SocialMedia,HarmedTeens,Who is a pro social media user?,"Hi, Im Alex. Im 16. Im on Instagram, tiktok and a little bit of youtube and I am pro social media because it helped me meet a lot of other trans kids when I was struggling."
SocialMedia,RuinsYourLife,How does Google trick us?,"youtube, its not necessarily bad for you. Uh Remember this is a statistical distribution. So for some percentage of people, itll have an effect of making them uh crankier around election time and feeling needier around the time they might be making a purchase and so forth. And the way it works is that all the data Google can get on you much of which comes from um just your email or, or whatever else it might be is fed into an engine that compares you with other people who share some similar traits and youtubes ordering of videos that are presented to you is designed to on the one hand maximize your engagement. So you wont stop watching, but thats achieved not just by observing you, but by a multitude of people who are similar to you. And then when you do get an ad, its contextualized in a way that has been shown to be effective, not only for you but for this whole population. So its this giant statistical thing and its bad for you because it leaches your free will. It makes you cranky. It, it makes the world a little darker because youre not perceiving reality clearly anymore. Youre be, its being, uh, manipulated, its being, uh, tricked in a way. Uh, and, uh, it, uh, the, the people who are paying or maybe not paying just using the system to, uh, in a clever way to get at you are not necessarily, um, pleasant people. Theyre, theyre, theyre sort of the worst actors in some cases."
SocialMedia,RuinsYourLife,What was talked about social media and the Russian involment?,"There are 21 of them is for your own good and the other is for societys good for your own good. Its because youre being subtly manipulated by algorithms that are watching everything you do constantly and then sending you changes in your media feed in your diet that are calculated to adjust you slightly to the liking of some unseen advertiser. And so if you get off that you can have a chance to experience a clearer view of yourself and your life. Uh But then the, the reason for society might be even more important. Society has been gradually darkened by this scheme in which everyone is under surveillance all the time and everyone is under this mild version of behavior modification all the time. Its made people jittery and cranky. Its made uh teens especially depressed, which can be quite severe. But its made our politics kind of unreal and strange where were not sure if elections are real anymore. Were not sure how much the Russians affected Brexit. We do know that it was a crankier affair than it might have been. Otherwise"
HR,OfficeRelocation1,Do people need a reading room?,"Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning."
HR,OfficeRelocation1,Is the room which is in the opposite of the north east more sunny?,"we have. So it does mean that the three piece room which is in the opposite of the north east is the more sunny one. This one, lets say that"
HR,OfficeRelocation1,Whats the maximum capacity of the rooms?,"yeah, thats a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, its quite, then everyone has an office, right? Cause its maximum 18. So take away three spaces and youre down to your 15 and youre right. If we do have a stagger or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose."
HR,OfficeRelocation1,Is the office building facing South?,"we face the old town now? And were facing north east, north east sunrise? Okay. So this is east, north east. We, we have sun in the morning only.
"
HR,OfficeRelocation2,Do Martin and Andre share the same office room?,Ok. And we have right No. Do you think its a good idea to put Martin and Andre together since theyre working on the Sa Me project? Yeah
HR,OfficeRelocation2,Is there a coffee machine on the sixth floor of the office?,"Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine."
HR,OfficeRelocation2,Is there air conditioning in the office?,"And do we know if there will be air conditioning? ""Is there actually a smoking area somewhere?  No, not  for non smoking  building."" Yeah, but we, okay. We have the terrace still on the building
"
HR,OfficeRelocation2,Which office room was allocated to Nancy?,So David and Nichols its done. And so where were we? Uh and Nancy Andre and Nancy maybe we can put pet and her T 22 phd students into one room.
HR,OfficeRelocation2,Who has reception hours?,this having quite a un avant situation because there a re Marian and Bruno who a re having reception hours. But thats so if you can
HR,OfficeRelocation3,What are the constrainfs in terms of furniture?,"we have some constraints in terms of furniture. Uh theyre here. So, um well, your, your person, your, your question actually is answered maybe by the third item. So each person should get. Um Well, its a sort of desk, its made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with, of course, a chair, uh, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk. Uh, and, well, we can put hanging shelves over the, the desks. So Im not really sure. Its possible to get 33 desks in a two person office. But, um, we could try whats, what should be said here. I dont know if, well, you, I, I will maybe distribute now documents if you dont have them, maybe its easier. Do you need something, Martin? We can keep this for you. Uh So its, its, yeah, you have a copy, Susan, you to David. I think so. In fact, there a re more places than people. So we wont be that constrained uh as you know, some of us and some of you here actually Martin David a re part time. So it, its for the moment, quite comfortable. Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for, you know, temporary people coming to work on uh on projects. Uh Yeah, I uh yeah, I counted so we have um 15 pers physical persons and about uh 16, I think uh persons or actually 18 persons in the offices,"
HR,OfficeRelocation3,Does Maggie receive a lot of student visits in her office?,"Well, certainly we have to ask, uh, and, uh, and Maggie since theyre not here because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do. And so thats another consideration too."
HR,OfficeRelocation3,Is smoking allowed in the office space?,"Ok. Yeah, thats true. So, smoking is now no longer a constrain. Well, except for maybe you dont want anybody smoking on your balcony. So, is it allowed to smoke inside an office if its one person? Not anymore? No, its in principle, its a, its a no smoking building, you can smoke outside so you can go outside onto the, not even
"
HR,OfficeRelocation3,Which office would the foreign researcher take?,"I mean, you have, you have a for foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put, put him in the admin office."
HR,OfficeRelocation3,Is there coffee in the reading room of the office?,There is no coffee in the reading room.
HR,OfficeRelocation4,Who is switching office space with Gisela?,have a suggestion to put Gisela to switch Nancy and Gisela.
HR,OfficeRelocation4,Would Susan like her own office?,"Okay. Then let me um explain very briefly, the, the rationale for, for this. So its the sa me uh schema that, you know, in red you have the uh uh oh excuse me. Thats quite uh annoying. Excuse me. Um Hello. Oh, yeah. Um Can, can I call you a bit later in about half an hour? Im just in the middle of a meeting and Im talking. Oh, okay. Thank you. Bye bye. Um Sorry for this. Fortunately we were just uh the four of us. Um Okay, so let me get back to, to the proposal after a brief interruption. Um So the NA Mes A rein red now. Um well, one of the reasons a t least for me for doing this was to more or less group people uh with within projects because I, I think that sometimes they, they just discuss together and uh its easier if theyre in the SA ME office and um which is quite happy. Actually, I, I also thought that some professors might enjoy or a t least uh dont, dont say anything about being with their assistant. So I was happy to hear Susan um saying that Maggie and Bruno could go on well together and Pierrette and uh Marian Inin the Sa Me office. Um So what I can say is uh that I also understood that Susan would be rather in favour of uh well having her own office. So uh its, its, its working like this. I put the lounge in the middle. Its also one of the rooms with the fewer uh the fewest uh windows. So I think thats not a problem because youre not going to just stay there and stare outside. Uh But its, its nicer to have a nicer view from your office. I guess"
HR,OfficeRelocation4,Who does not like having printers in their office?,Gisela will not be very happy about that. Uh We tried that and Gisela really didnt like to have the printer and people in and out.
HR,OfficeRelocation4,Who would switch offices with Gisela?,have a suggestion to put Gisela to switch Nancy and Gisela.
HR,OfficeRelocation4,Would they put the printer in the lounge area in the office?,putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge.
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffKickOff,What is the goal of the new diffs architecture document?,"The goal of the new diffs architecture document is to create a design document covering the architecture for diffs from start to finish, in order to support a better way of doing diffs. This document will cover all scenarios where diffs are used around GitLab and will be designed for reusability."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffKickOff,What is the scope of the effort to rethink the addressability of comments on diffs?,"The effort aims to explore the possibility of attaching comments to different elements within a diff, beyond just lines of code. This could include things like code objects, commit messages, or specific structures within the code. The goal is to improve the flexibility and expressiveness of code reviews. While the initial focus is on replicating current functionality, the design should be open to future possibilities."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffKickOff,Should we have an issue to discuss and define the goals of the project together?,"Yes, we can create an issue with an example of what the goals could look like, then everyone can participate in defining them together."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffKickOff,Should we use Google Drive or GitLab for the documentation and artifacts?,It depends on the purpose. Use Google Drive for drafts and temporary storage of artifacts like audits. Use GitLab for final documentation and linking larger artifacts from Google Drive. Consider using a public wiki for wider visibility and collaboration.
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiff,Do the new flow charts from Patrick include the Gitaly side of things?,"No, the flow charts currently only show the ""RB that we call"" from Italy. They do not include the Gitaly client ""Tiff Stitcher"". There will be a separate call to discuss these differences once all the charts are available."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiff,Does the current front-end mermaid chart include the file-by-file A/B mode logic?,"No, the current chart does not include the file-by-file A/B mode logic. It mainly focuses on components. While a separate chart for data flow is also suggested, the priority is to first convert the existing chart to Mermaid and then iterate from there. The goal is to have a comprehensive understanding of the front-end logic, including comparisons to source code and potential for unification."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiff,"Should we create two separate lists for priorities: one for binary ""do or don't"" options and another for things on a scale?","Maybe. Accessibility might still be a spectrum depending on compliance levels, but the core idea is good. The goal is to clarify different factors like perceived performance, accessibility, developer experience, and coverage, and how they can sometimes have opposing goals. It's important to discuss when it's okay to sacrifice one for the other based on specific contexts like feature adoption or performance impact."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiff,"Should we add accessibility to the priority list, and if so, where should it be placed?","Accessibility should be considered part of the ""meaningful metrics"" that define a complete feature, rather than a separate item on the priority list. This means that a feature is not considered finished until it meets accessibility standards. However, there are different levels of accessibility compliance (AAA, AA, A), and the specific level for a feature can be determined and documented in the meaningful metrics."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffWeekly,Should the A P A call time be changed to 1 AM UTC to accommodate people in America?,"No, 1 AM UTC would still be too late for Americas. The speaker proposes changing the time to midnight UTC and see if that works better."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffWeekly,"Should we highlight all the files in a diff at once, or just highlight a few initially and highlight the rest on demand?","The answer is not directly given in the transcript, but the speaker suggests investigating if it's possible to only highlight a few files initially and highlight the rest on demand to save processing power. This would be especially useful for diffs with many files changed."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffWeekly,Is it possible to only highlight a few files initially and highlight the rest on demand to improve performance?,"The answer is no, not currently. Highlighting all files at once is necessary because the backend fetches the whole content of the files and highlights them before sending them to the frontend. However, the speaker suggests investigating alternative approaches like fetching only the necessary parts of the files or postponing highlighting until the user scrolls to them. A dedicated discussion about highlighting optimization is planned."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffWeekly,What should be included in the workflow document and how will it be used?,"The workflow document will include all implementation details, like what needs to be done and how it will be done. It will also link to other relevant issues and documents. The goal is to have a clear and concise document that guides the project implementation."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffWeekly,What is the status of the code review for the back end?,Several MRs are being merged/reviewed into the back end page. It is recommended to take a look at the diagrams to understand the changes better.
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffBlueprint,Who is now the coach for the team?,Finna is now our coach.
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffBlueprint,What is the best time for the APA call considering the timezones of the participants?,There is no perfect time for the APA call that works for everyone due to timezone differences. Moving the call earlier would benefit Patrick but conflict with the front end weekly meeting. Moving it later would benefit the front end folks but prevent Patrick and potentially others from attending.
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffBlueprint,What are the target users for the technical performance metrics?,"There is no consensus on who the target users for the technical performance metrics should be. Thomas believes it should be users on low-power devices with unreliable networks, while Stanislav points out that most performance complaints come from users reviewing large measure quests. Ultimately, the decision of who to target will depend on further discussion and input from others."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffBlueprint,Should the chart added to the docs about the Diffs App be reviewed for completeness?,"Yes, the chart about the Diffs App added to the docs should be reviewed for completeness. While it includes the component tree, it might be missing views and data aspects."
Architecture,ArchDesignNewDiffBlueprint,Should the features of each component be documented in a spreadsheet or a markdown table?,"The features of each component should be documented in a spreadsheet or a markdown table. It is not necessary to have everything in one diagram, and a spreadsheet or markdown table would be a more suitable format for listing out all of the features and their applicability to different contexts."
Architecture,BackdropWeeklyDevMeet,Should the issue about the CKEditor dialogue bug be filed against D2B or Core?,"The answer is not directly mentioned in the transcript. Irene asks whether the issue should be filed against D2B or Core, but Nate does not answer her question."
Architecture,BackdropWeeklyDevMeet,Should the new hook for field schema modifications be included in the 127 release or a later release?,"The new hook for field schema modifications (issue 6208) will be included in the 127 release. John brought it up and Nate confirmed it is in the bug fix milestone. Nate mentioned this is because it is a missing feature from Drupal that would cause upgrade issues, so it is considered a bug fix."
Architecture,BackdropWeeklyDevMeet,What is the best way to refresh an outdated pull request that is not yours?,"Tim asks for the best way to refresh an outdated pull request that is not his own. Nate suggests using the ""Rebase"" button within the GitHub UI if it is his own pull request. However, since it is someone else's pull request, Tim cannot use that button. Nate suggests creating a new pull request with the updated code or opening a new pull request on top of the existing one, but does not explicitly recommend which is the best approach."
Architecture,BackdropWeeklyDevMeet,What are change records and how do I create them?,"Tim asks what change records are and how to create them. Nate says there isn't much documentation but there is a link on the docs.backdropcms.org homepage under appendix/reference called ""Change Records"". This page lists all of the API changes and breaks since Drupal seven. However, Nate says there aren't many issues that actually need change records because if the issue is closed, the change record has already been written. He clarifies that there is a label for ""needs change record"" but not for ""has change record"". So, if an issue is closed but has the ""needs change record"" label, it means it needs to be written. There are a couple of open issues that are marked this way, but they are open because the change record isn't written yet, not because the code isn't in."
Architecture,BackdropWeeklyDevMeet,What is the next step to make the next release of the D2B module happen?,"The next step to make the next release of the D2B module happen is to create an issue requesting a new release. This can be done through Zulip or by creating an issue in the Drupal project management system. It is important to note that if there are any bugs in the module, it is still recommended to release it as it is still under development and the bugs can be fixed in future releases."
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff1,What is the first theme that Vi Chetta will be covering in her presentation?,The first theme that Vi Chetta will be covering in her presentation is the world-class DevSecOps experience. She will be discussing two new features that are aligned with this theme: the ability to persist user settings in the web ID and multiple version support for GitLab Pages.
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff1,What is one of the new features in the SEC section?,One of the new features in the SEC section is a new AI experiment to resolve vulnerabilities. This experiment will be available on the vulnerability details page and will allow users to automatically generate a merge request or get a recommendation to resolve the vulnerability.
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff1,What is one of the improvements being made to group-level dependency lists?,One of the improvements being made to group-level dependency lists is the addition of a new filter for projects. This will allow users to more easily see the dependencies for specific projects within a group.
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff1,What is one of the new features planned for Duo Chat?,One of the new features planned for Duo Chat is the ability to ask questions about code as you use chat in GitLab vs code IDE. This will be achieved by introducing code file context to chat.
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff1,What is one new feature planned for GitLab's code search?,"One new feature planned for GitLab's code search is the ability to index all projects with Google searches. This will allow for quicker and more complete search results. Additionally, the autosuggest feature in the search box will be preloaded, making the overall UI feel more responsive."
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff2,What is one new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8?,"One new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8 is the ability to have multiple deployments. This will allow users to easily make changes and see what those changes are without affecting the production deployment. Additionally, a new way to add DNS to GitLab Pages without a wildcard will be available, opening up more options for users."
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff2,What will Threat Insights team be doing in this milestone?,"The Threat Insights team will be spending the milestone on a bug bash, focusing on fixing new issues and improving performance. They will also be using this time to set themselves up for the next year."
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff2,What are the improvements planned for the pipeline execution group in milestone 16.8?,"The pipeline execution group plans to add a keyword to after scripts, allowing them to recognize canceling statuses. This will be helpful for situations like running tests on device farms or having blocked Terraform scripts."
Architecture,GitlabMonthlyReleaseKickoff2,What are the two main improvements planned for GitLab Duo Chat in this milestone?,"The two main improvements planned for GitLab Duo Chat in this milestone are: Bringing GitLab Duo Chat to self-managed and dedicated instances, mirroring the experience for .com users (excluding support for questions about GitLab documentation). Introducing streaming into GitLab Duo Chat and IDE to receive responses faster and allow you to read them as they come in."
Architecture,ProductMarketingMeeting,How are we measuring excitement levels for the product announcements?,"It's a judgment call based on various factors like upvotes, customer demand, MAU (Monthly Active Users), and anecdotal feedback. There's no single metric and it can be a 1, 2, or 3 ranking, representing low, medium, or high excitement. It might be limited to 3 per stage and treated as a stack rank rather than raw level."
Architecture,ProductMarketingMeeting,What is the goal of selecting a top 5 list from the 20-30 features list?,"The goal is to identify the top 5 most exciting announcements for the product keynote at the Commit event. These announcements should be newsworthy and generate interest from the press. While some of the features may have been around for a while, they should now be at a level of maturity or have new integrations that make them more exciting."
Architecture,ProductMarketingMeeting,"Does each stage in the competitive sheet need to have the same 5 listed competitors, or should the competitors be specific to that stage?","The competitors listed in the competitive sheet should be specific to each stage, not the same for all stages. While initially tier one competitors were copied across all stages, this is incorrect. Only competitors relevant to the specific stage should be included, even if that means leaving some competitor slots blank."
Architecture,ProductMarketingMeeting,"Should the competitor analysis use the same 5 competitors for each stage, or should they be specific to each stage?","Competitors in the analysis should be specific to each stage, not the same for all stages. While initially tier one competitors were copied across all stages, this is incorrect. Only relevant competitors for the specific stage should be included, even if some competitor slots are left blank. For example, ""platform"" competitors like Atlassian might only be relevant for the ""configure"" stage and not others."
Architecture,ProductMarketingMeeting,"Should the messaging use the same colors as the competitor analysis (red, yellow, green), or should they be different?","The messaging should not use the same colors as the competitor analysis. While the competitor analysis uses red, yellow, and green to show different levels of performance, the messaging should be helpful and avoid negativity. Instead, it should use colors that are easy on the eyes and lend itself to being a comparison rather than a competition piece."
RemoteControl,MixHeadset_1,"What are the main components required for a remote control to function, as discussed in the meeting?","he basic components are an energy source (usually batteries), a user interface (buttons), a chip, and a sender (usually infrared)."
RemoteControl,MixHeadset_1,How does the sender of the remote control work?,The sender interprets which button you press and then sends the appropriate message to the television.
RemoteControl,MixHeadset_1,"What considerations were made regarding the design of the remote control?


","There was a preference for a simple design with big buttons and clear labeling, incorporating the corporate color scheme and logo.
"
RemoteControl,MixHeadset_2,What are some potential features for the new remote control?,"Some potential features discussed include speech recognition, a ""whistle back"" function for locating the remote, and a menu system controlled by buttons."
RemoteControl,MixHeadset_2,What considerations are there for incorporating speech recognition technology?,There's concern about the cost of implementing speech recognition and the potential for the TV to interpret background noise as commands. There's also discussion about whether a whistle or clap function might be simpler and more universal
RemoteControl,MixHeadset_2,How might the menu system work for the remote control?,The menu system could involve using numbered buttons along with a menu function to access various features such as adjusting brightness and contrast. It's suggested that instructions could be provided alongside the buttons to make navigation easier for users.
