What is a common recommendation regarding the age limit for children on social media platforms?,"[ContentBlock(text='Based on the context provided, a common recommendation is that children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media platforms. Some key points:\n\n- Organizations are advocating for kids to get access to social media at an older age, not as young as 13.\n\n- There are concerns that kids at a young age like 13 may post inappropriate content without fully understanding the consequences, as one speaker noted ""Kids are dumb and if you give kids a platform to do whatever they want, they\'re gonna be dumb.""\n\n- Even if age restrictions are put in place, kids may still find ways to get around them and lie about their age to access social media. \n\n- Rather than just restricting access, some suggest the focus should be on education, such as having ""tech ed"" classes in school to teach responsible use of technology and social media.\n\nSo in summary, while a specific age limit is debated, a common view is that children younger than 13 are not mature enough for social media, and there should be more education and guidance provided around appropriate use of these platforms.', type='text')]",Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.,"00:15:35 - spk_6: social media has changed your
00:15:36 - spk_0: life 100%? I dont think I would be the person I am if it wasnt for social media. I first came out on Tik Tok and my parents didnt even know thats how they found out. Actually,
00:15:47 - spk_6: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.
00:15:58 - spk_5: Well, um its kind of funny because I talked to a lot of organizations with log off. And the main point that they try to get across is that theyre trying to advocate for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at an older age. Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said thats really stupid. Thats like the drug talk, like, dont do drugs, dont be on social media. Im not gonna listen to that. But then after years of kind of self reflection, I wish someone would have said you dont need Instagram to have a social  life
 if I go back to like my 13 year old self and like,
00:16:25 - spk_2: I didnt have all the experiences I had and I just kind of knew like, oh, its a good place I would be posting God knows what right. Kids are dumb and if you give kids a platform to do whatever they want, theyre gonna be dumb.
00:16:51 - spk_4: You know, I just feel like its almost, its just unrealistic when I was 13, I was fully on social media making videos every single day. So I just feel like if anything, it helped me more when I was 13, like it really allowed me to just know what things were and not be so what is going on.  Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things
 because like, I was on social media,
00:17:07 - spk_0: like 11 years old, like I was a child and on social media and my, my dad told me he was like, you know, but youre also trans and youre also like LGBT, you know, you need to be able to meet people because your bubble that you would know of trans people would be zero.
00:17:21 - spk_1: Heres the thing we, we, I think were underestimating Children. Theyre relentless. We put an age limit on Instagram or an age limit on like um an adult type website. Theyre still gonna get through.
00:17:30 - spk_3: I didnt have social media. I was probably like the last couple of people out of my like friends because my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet is. You cant control what other people are posting and you cant control what your kids are seeing. But I believe that like other kids mature at different ages and we cant really rest like restrict certain people from going on this platform when its public.
00:17:51 - spk_5: Its difficult because I, I do think what you said is true where if I was 13 and someone said you have to be 13 to get on this app or you or like you have to be older, I would have lied about my, my age and I know there are millions of kids like that that are like, he, he, he break the system and be, like, put in a different age.  See,
 thats the thing with any problem.
00:18:11 - spk_1: You cant just take the problem and move it over here. Its all about the education. It should be a class, like how sex ed is,  there should be like tech ed, like
 computer lab days exist.

One participant mentioned being bullied by their dance team members, who would include them in photos only to later make fun of them on Instagram.\n\n4. Cyberbullying can have severe consequences, with some participants mentioning that it made them feel like they wanted to kill themselves or that it deeply upset them.\n\n5. Strategies to deal with cyberbullying were discussed, such as blocking the bullies, not engaging with their content, and realizing that the bullying will eventually stop if not given attention.\n\n6.

So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute?

Like if youre searching anything on, like if youre searching something up on safari and you go onto your computer onto Chrome, the ads will probably be the same, you know, its just,  its just technology,
 you know.
00:09:17 - spk_1: Um I sat down here saying that social media makes people antisocial. But hearing Alexa and Alex speak, it makes me remember that um social media isnt just, you know, the whole tiktok scene. Its also schools, theres clubs and stuff. Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near. I do see how social media can be bad, but I, I like to think of it in a positive light.
00:09:55 - spk_6: I have been bullied on social media.
00:10:01 - spk_4: Mhm I know you guys remember like those musically days, I feel like that was my biggest bullying because its like when you, its just like entering a whole different society, its just like when youre going out, youre making videos, you dont really know what you wanna post or what you wanna do or what you wanna look like. So it is gonna be cringy at first and its not gonna be great.  Musically
 was definitely a dark time.
00:10:22 - spk_0: Um More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram. They um like told me to kill myself and told me that like, because I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself. And that I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really, really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know, like, theyre only making fun of me because Im giving them attention about it. So I just had to, like, block them from all my accounts and block all the people they were following and block all the people that were following them and then I just had to stop looking. And if I dont look at it,  then I dont know what theyre saying.
 Right. And thats the thing.
00:10:56 - spk_4: Its just like, once you stop looking into it, its, you just stop beating the fire and it will die eventually because  you just dont even pay it. No mind.
 I dont have a big following.
00:11:04 - spk_3: So its mostly, mostly people I know usually its Tik Toks and its not with my name in it, but you can tell that its implied towards me and I try not to comment but like, theres some points where theyre coming out and saying like, completely false things about me posting and hating on someone through the internet is completely different from in person because its there forever. You dont have control over that because its up to them to delete it.
00:11:27 - spk_5: So I have had rude comments been made about me, but Ive never been like, heavily cyberbullied because I dont really have a big following and because of the community that Im in, Ive just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like, felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were getting.

 it.

00:13:28 - spk_2: I have this one photo thats so vivid in my memory and like Im at like an aquarium and Im leaning against like one of the fish tanks and my dad and my dad and my brother are next to me and Im like half my brothers height, my face sagging my body like my clothes dont fit on me. And Im like, at that time I didnt realize how depressed I was and how, how much these, like, these, like, dance photos were ruining me. Thats kind of when I knew like, social media is not something I like, Im not safe here, you know, and so an excuse I can make for not pleasing people online is that I dont use it and then Ill be ok.
00:18:25 - spk_2: when you practice typing, like, instead of just practicing typing, practice how to not be an idiot online and, like, how to, like, learn and understand, like, the harm of it because, like, if I had that education, I know that, like, I would have, like, at least braced myself for it once COVID kinda hit I realized like, I need social media or else I cant, like, find anyone. I know some people that kind of think, like, when I say that I dont use social media a lot, theyre like, oh, do you think youre cooler than us because you dont need, like, social media validation?

00:19:02 - spk_6: Social media more than my school heart.
00:19:10 - spk_3: Yes. I know all schools they dont talk about some deep topics that social media brings to light and it teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it and how to do it without talking to your family if you are uncomfortable and without talking to the school because sometimes schools dont have that education in place.  My
 teacher told everyone
00:19:29 - spk_0: that Rupauls drag race was a good example of trans people. Of course, like I got in trouble for like, correcting him or whatever, but it was like, I could not let him spread fake information like that. Those are not trans people, those are drag queens. And that is a totally different topic. Im very far in my transition for 16 and it social media definitely helped me a lot.
00:19:51 - spk_1: And then the fact that you even got in trouble for that shows that school is that like, you know, theyre lacking,  you
 know, personal experience is how you learn the most, you know,
00:19:58 - spk_4: you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do.
00:20:10 - spk_5: I wanna preface it with. I am kind of like, Im very lucky. Um The school that I go to Altamont is like a private school in Alabama and theyre very, very good with kind of integrating these conversations into the academic dialogue. I, I totally agree with everything yall have said. Ive learned how to Rainbow Loom and Ive done a bunch of different things on social media but Ive also looked up like election and theres been misinformation after misinformation and with COVID. So for yall that answered, how do you, how you kind of outweigh like the chance to learn a bunch of new things, but also the chance of seeing a lot of stuff that isnt necessarily true.  I
 think you just have to look for credible websites.
00:20:44 - spk_4: I mean, its just like when youre doing an essay, you wouldnt believe. I, I just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff. It is easy to get a lot of misinformation, but its also easy to see that this information is fake.  Like, but
 what about like a young kid that cant really discern that?

Do people need a reading room?,"[ContentBlock(text='Yes, based on the provided context, it seems that people do want a reading room. A few key points:\n\n1.

At 00:04:02, Speaker 2 also brings up the reading room, indicating it is a point of discussion.\n\nSo while there may be some debate about the relative importance of comfortable offices vs a comfortable reading room, it does appear that providing a reading room is a desire that has been expressed by many people in the group. The conversation suggests allocating space for a reading room is part of the office planning process.', type='text')]","Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.","00:04:09 - spk_2: So we only get one printer for 15 people.
00:04:12 - spk_1: Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer. Gisella has one. Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out. But just in case and theres just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The, the three person room on the right. Yeah.
00:05:16 - spk_0: And do we need a room? Like a reading room?

00:04:07 - spk_0:  But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading or more,
 I, I
00:04:10 - spk_2: you, I mean uh I think everybody is supposed to spend more time in the office than in the reading room. So we might think that its better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room. I dont know, it changed the plan of the morning. Im sorry, but I just realise that stupid architect put on the one windows who built this building. Do we know that? I dont know. I dunno, do you think?  I
 dunno, we spent

 good.

Does the current front-end mermaid chart include the file-by-file A/B mode logic?,"[ContentBlock(text='Based on the provided context, it seems that the current front-end mermaid chart does not include the detailed file-by-file A/B mode logic.
