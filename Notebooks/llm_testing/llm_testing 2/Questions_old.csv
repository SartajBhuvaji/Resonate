Social Media,What is a common recommendation regarding the age limit for children on social media platforms?,Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.
Social Media,What was discussed about cyberbullying?,"My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?"
Social Media,Did they talk about social media and eating disorder?,"you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do."
HR,Do people need a reading room?,"Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning."
HR,Whats the maximum capacity of the rooms?,"yeah, thats a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, its quite, then everyone has an office, right? Cause its maximum 18. So take away three spaces and youre down to your 15 and youre right. If we do have a stagger or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose."
HR,Is there a coffee machine on the sixth floor of the office?,"Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine."
HR,Is there air conditioning in the office?,"And do we know if there will be air conditioning? ""Is there actually a smoking area somewhere?  No, not  for non smoking  building."" Yeah, but we, okay. We have the terrace still on the building
"
Architecture,Should we have two calls per week to accommodate different time zones? One on Tuesday and one on Thursday.,"Yes, this is the plan for now. The times are not final and can be adjusted based on feedback. The goal is to be inclusive and allow everyone to participate, even if they can't attend both calls. You can watch recordings and add points for discussion asynchronously. If the calls are not well attended, we may switch back to one call per week."
Architecture,Do the new flow charts from Patrick include the Gitaly side of things?,"No, the flow charts currently only show the ""RB that we call"" from Italy. They do not include the Gitaly client ""Tiff Stitcher"". There will be a separate call to discuss these differences once all the charts are available."
Architecture,Does the current front-end mermaid chart include the file-by-file A/B mode logic?,"No, the current chart does not include the file-by-file A/B mode logic. It mainly focuses on components. While a separate chart for data flow is also suggested, the priority is to first convert the existing chart to Mermaid and then iterate from there. The goal is to have a comprehensive understanding of the front-end logic, including comparisons to source code and potential for unification."
Architecture,What is one new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8?,"One new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8 is the ability to have multiple deployments. This will allow users to easily make changes and see what those changes are without affecting the production deployment. Additionally, a new way to add DNS to GitLab Pages without a wildcard will be available, opening up more options for users."
