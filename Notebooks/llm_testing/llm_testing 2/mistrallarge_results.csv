Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near.

So it is gonna be cringy at first and its not gonna be great.  Musically\n was definitely a dark time.\n00:10:22 - spk_0: Um More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram. They um like told me to kill myself and told me that like, because I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself. And that I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really, really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know, like, theyre only making fun of me because Im giving them attention about it. So I just had to, like, block them from all my accounts and block all the people they were following and block all the people that were following them and then I just had to stop looking. And if I dont look at it,  then I dont know what theyre saying.\n Right. And thats the thing.\n00:10:56 - spk_4: Its just like, once you stop looking into it, its, you just stop beating the fire and it will die eventually because  you just dont even pay it. No mind.\n I dont have a big following.\n00:11:04 - spk_3: So its mostly, mostly people I know usually its Tik Toks and its not with my name in it, but you can tell that its implied towards me and I try not to comment but like, theres some points where theyre coming out and saying like, completely false things about me posting and hating on someone through the internet is completely different from in person because its there forever. You dont have control over that because its up to them to delete it.\n00:11:27 - spk_5: So I have had rude comments been made about me, but Ive never been like, heavily cyberbullied because I dont really have a big following and because of the community that Im in, Ive just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like, felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were getting. And I just remember like, there were nights when I,  I would cry and Id be so upset because I couldnt really do anything about\n it.\n00:11:50 - spk_2: My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?\n00:13:01 - spk_6:  Social media can cause young people to hurt\n themselves.\n00:13:10 - spk_5: Instagram, tiktok. Everything is the highlight reel.

I know all schools they dont talk about some deep topics that social media brings to light and it teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it and how to do it without talking to your family if you are uncomfortable and without talking to the school because sometimes schools dont have that education in place.  My\n teacher told everyone\n00:19:29 - spk_0: that Rupauls drag race was a good example of trans people.

I\n think you just have to look for credible websites.\n00:20:44 - spk_4: I mean, its just like when youre doing an essay, you wouldnt believe. I, I just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff.

I know some people that kind of think, like, when I say that I dont use social media a lot, theyre like, oh, do you think youre cooler than us because you dont need, like, social media validation? But its more like Im afraid of if I search for that validation that Im not gonna get it.\n00:19:02 - spk_6: Social media more than my school heart.\n00:19:10 - spk_3: Yes. I know all schools they dont talk about some deep topics that social media brings to light and it teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it and how to do it without talking to your family if you are uncomfortable and without talking to the school because sometimes schools dont have that education in place.  My\n teacher told everyone\n00:19:29 - spk_0: that Rupauls drag race was a good example of trans people. Of course, like I got in trouble for like, correcting him or whatever, but it was like, I could not let him spread fake information like that. Those are not trans people, those are drag queens. And that is a totally different topic. Im very far in my transition for 16 and it social media definitely helped me a lot.\n00:19:51 - spk_1: And then the fact that you even got in trouble for that shows that school is that like, you know, theyre lacking,  you\n know, personal experience is how you learn the most, you know,\n00:19:58 - spk_4: you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do.\n00:20:10 - spk_5: I wanna preface it with. I am kind of like, Im very lucky. Um The school that I go to Altamont is like a private school in Alabama and theyre very, very good with kind of integrating these conversations into the academic dialogue. I, I totally agree with everything yall have said. Ive learned how to Rainbow Loom and Ive done a bunch of different things on social media but Ive also looked up like election and theres been misinformation after misinformation and with COVID. So for yall that answered, how do you, how you kind of outweigh like the chance to learn a bunch of new things, but also the chance of seeing a lot of stuff that isnt necessarily true.  I\n think you just have to look for credible websites.\n00:20:44 - spk_4: I mean, its just like when youre doing an essay, you wouldnt believe. I, I just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff.

And I just remember like, there were nights when I,  I would cry and Id be so upset because I couldnt really do anything about\n it.\n00:11:50 - spk_2: My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?\n00:13:01 - spk_6:  Social media can cause young people to hurt\n themselves.\n00:13:10 - spk_5: Instagram, tiktok. Everything is the highlight reel. My Instagram, Im not gonna post the ugliest picture of me when I scroll to my friends, I in the back of my head, I should know that that, thats the same for them yet. Im like, they look so pretty. Why do I not look like that? And I think for younger generations its really scary  that theyre gonna have to deal with\n this.\n00:13:28 - spk_2: I have this one photo thats so vivid in my memory and like Im at like an aquarium and Im leaning against like one of the fish tanks and my dad and my dad and my brother are next to me and Im like half my brothers height, my face sagging my body like my clothes dont fit on me. And Im like, at that time I didnt realize how depressed I was and how, how much these, like, these, like, dance photos were ruining me.
