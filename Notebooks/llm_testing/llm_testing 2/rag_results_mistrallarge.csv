What is a common recommendation regarding the age limit for children on social media platforms?,"The common recommendation is that children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media platforms. However, some people argue that social media can have positive effects for children, especially in terms of helping them connect with others and learn about the world. Ultimately, the decision about when a child is ready for social media depends on their maturity level and ability to use technology responsibly. Education about online safety and appropriate use of technology can also be helpful in preparing children for social media use at an older age.",Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.,"00:15:35 - spk_6: social media has changed your
00:15:36 - spk_0: life 100%? I dont think I would be the person I am if it wasnt for social media. I first came out on Tik Tok and my parents didnt even know thats how they found out. Actually,
00:15:47 - spk_6: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.
00:15:58 - spk_5: Well, um its kind of funny because I talked to a lot of organizations with log off. And the main point that they try to get across is that theyre trying to advocate for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at an older age. Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said thats really stupid. Thats like the drug talk, like, dont do drugs, dont be on social media. Im not gonna listen to that. But then after years of kind of self reflection, I wish someone would have said you dont need Instagram to have a social  life
 if I go back to like my 13 year old self and like,
00:16:25 - spk_2: I didnt have all the experiences I had and I just kind of knew like, oh, its a good place I would be posting God knows what right. Kids are dumb and if you give kids a platform to do whatever they want, theyre gonna be dumb.
00:16:51 - spk_4: You know, I just feel like its almost, its just unrealistic when I was 13, I was fully on social media making videos every single day. So I just feel like if anything, it helped me more when I was 13, like it really allowed me to just know what things were and not be so what is going on.  Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things
 because like, I was on social media,
00:17:07 - spk_0: like 11 years old, like I was a child and on social media and my, my dad told me he was like, you know, but youre also trans and youre also like LGBT, you know, you need to be able to meet people because your bubble that you would know of trans people would be zero.
00:17:21 - spk_1: Heres the thing we, we, I think were underestimating Children. Theyre relentless. We put an age limit on Instagram or an age limit on like um an adult type website. Theyre still gonna get through.
00:17:30 - spk_3: I didnt have social media. I was probably like the last couple of people out of my like friends because my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet is. You cant control what other people are posting and you cant control what your kids are seeing. But I believe that like other kids mature at different ages and we cant really rest like restrict certain people from going on this platform when its public.
00:17:51 - spk_5: Its difficult because I, I do think what you said is true where if I was 13 and someone said you have to be 13 to get on this app or you or like you have to be older, I would have lied about my, my age and I know there are millions of kids like that that are like, he, he, he break the system and be, like, put in a different age.  See,
 thats the thing with any problem.
00:18:11 - spk_1: You cant just take the problem and move it over here. Its all about the education. It should be a class, like how sex ed is,  there should be like tech ed, like
 computer lab days exist.

What was discussed about cyberbullying?,"Several speakers in the conversation shared their experiences with cyberbullying on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Musically. They talked about how it can be emotionally distressing and harmful, leading some to feel low self-esteem and even consider suicide. Speakers mentioned that cyberbullying can be particularly challenging because once the harmful comments are posted, they can be seen by a large audience and are permanent. Some speakers noted that they tried to ignore the bullying by not looking at it or blocking the bullies, but it was not always easy to do so. Others mentioned that they had been bullied for their appearance, weight, or race. Overall, the conversation highlighted the negative impacts of cyberbullying on young people and the need to deal with it in a healthy and supportive way.","My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?","00:09:05 - spk_0: Even if youre not on social media, you know, its gonna do that anyway. Like if youre searching anything on, like if youre searching something up on safari and you go onto your computer onto Chrome, the ads will probably be the same, you know, its just,  its just technology,
 you know.
00:09:17 - spk_1: Um I sat down here saying that social media makes people antisocial. But hearing Alexa and Alex speak, it makes me remember that um social media isnt just, you know, the whole tiktok scene. Its also schools, theres clubs and stuff. Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near. I do see how social media can be bad, but I, I like to think of it in a positive light.
00:09:55 - spk_6: I have been bullied on social media.
00:10:01 - spk_4: Mhm I know you guys remember like those musically days, I feel like that was my biggest bullying because its like when you, its just like entering a whole different society, its just like when youre going out, youre making videos, you dont really know what you wanna post or what you wanna do or what you wanna look like. So it is gonna be cringy at first and its not gonna be great.  Musically
 was definitely a dark time.
00:10:22 - spk_0: Um More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram. They um like told me to kill myself and told me that like, because I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself. And that I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really, really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know, like, theyre only making fun of me because Im giving them attention about it. So I just had to, like, block them from all my accounts and block all the people they were following and block all the people that were following them and then I just had to stop looking. And if I dont look at it,  then I dont know what theyre saying.
 Right. And thats the thing.
00:10:56 - spk_4: Its just like, once you stop looking into it, its, you just stop beating the fire and it will die eventually because  you just dont even pay it. No mind.
 I dont have a big following.
00:11:04 - spk_3: So its mostly, mostly people I know usually its Tik Toks and its not with my name in it, but you can tell that its implied towards me and I try not to comment but like, theres some points where theyre coming out and saying like, completely false things about me posting and hating on someone through the internet is completely different from in person because its there forever. You dont have control over that because its up to them to delete it.
00:11:27 - spk_5: So I have had rude comments been made about me, but Ive never been like, heavily cyberbullied because I dont really have a big following and because of the community that Im in, Ive just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like, felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were getting. And I just remember like, there were nights when I,  I would cry and Id be so upset because I couldnt really do anything about
 it.
00:11:50 - spk_2: My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram.

00:13:01 - spk_6:  Social media can cause young people to hurt
 themselves.
00:13:10 - spk_5: Instagram, tiktok. Everything is the highlight reel. My Instagram, Im not gonna post the ugliest picture of me when I scroll to my friends, I in the back of my head, I should know that that, thats the same for them yet. Im like, they look so pretty. Why do I not look like that? And I think for younger generations its really scary  that theyre gonna have to deal with
 this.


"
Did they talk about social media and eating disorder?,"Yes, they did discuss social media and eating disorders. Speaker 1 mentioned that they had come across someone talking about an eating disorder on social media and giving real advice. Speaker 5 also touched on the topic of social media and misinformation related to eating disorders and COVID.","you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do.","00:11:27 - spk_5: So I have had rude comments been made about me, but Ive never been like, heavily cyberbullied because I dont really have a big following and because of the community that Im in, Ive just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like, felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were getting.

I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?
00:13:01 - spk_6:  Social media can cause young people to hurt
 themselves.
00:13:10 - spk_5: Instagram, tiktok. Everything is the highlight reel. My Instagram, Im not gonna post the ugliest picture of me when I scroll to my friends, I in the back of my head, I should know that that, thats the same for them yet. Im like, they look so pretty. Why do I not look like that? And I think for younger generations its really scary  that theyre gonna have to deal with
 this.
00:13:28 - spk_2: I have this one photo thats so vivid in my memory and like Im at like an aquarium and Im leaning against like one of the fish tanks and my dad and my dad and my brother are next to me and Im like half my brothers height, my face sagging my body like my clothes dont fit on me. And Im like, at that time I didnt realize how depressed I was and how, how much these, like, these, like, dance photos were ruining me. Thats kind of when I knew like, social media is not something I like, Im not safe here, you know, and so an excuse I can make for not pleasing people online is that I dont use it and then Ill be ok.
00:18:25 - spk_2: when you practice typing, like, instead of just practicing typing, practice how to not be an idiot online and, like, how to, like, learn and understand, like, the harm of it because, like, if I had that education, I know that, like, I would have, like, at least braced myself for it once COVID kinda hit I realized like, I need social media or else I cant, like, find anyone. I know some people that kind of think, like, when I say that I dont use social media a lot, theyre like, oh, do you think youre cooler than us because you dont need, like, social media validation? But its more like Im afraid of if I search for that validation that Im not gonna get it.
00:19:02 - spk_6: Social media more than my school heart.
00:19:10 - spk_3: Yes. I know all schools they dont talk about some deep topics that social media brings to light and it teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it and how to do it without talking to your family if you are uncomfortable and without talking to the school because sometimes schools dont have that education in place.  My
 teacher told everyone
00:19:29 - spk_0: that Rupauls drag race was a good example of trans people. Of course, like I got in trouble for like, correcting him or whatever, but it was like, I could not let him spread fake information like that. Those are not trans people, those are drag queens. And that is a totally different topic. Im very far in my transition for 16 and it social media definitely helped me a lot.
00:19:51 - spk_1: And then the fact that you even got in trouble for that shows that school is that like, you know, theyre lacking,  you
 know, personal experience is how you learn the most, you know,
00:19:58 - spk_4: you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do.
00:20:10 - spk_5: I wanna preface it with. I am kind of like, Im very lucky. Um The school that I go to Altamont is like a private school in Alabama and theyre very, very good with kind of integrating these conversations into the academic dialogue. I, I totally agree with everything yall have said. Ive learned how to Rainbow Loom and Ive done a bunch of different things on social media but Ive also looked up like election and theres been misinformation after misinformation and with COVID. So for yall that answered, how do you, how you kind of outweigh like the chance to learn a bunch of new things, but also the chance of seeing a lot of stuff that isnt necessarily true.  I
 think you just have to look for credible websites.
00:20:44 - spk_4: I mean, its just like when youre doing an essay, you wouldnt believe. I, I just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff. It is easy to get a lot of misinformation, but its also easy to see that this information is fake.  Like, but
 what about like a young kid that cant really discern that?


"
Do people need a reading room?,"Based on the information provided, yes, people have expressed a desire for a reading room. However, it seems that there are concerns about the size of the rooms and the availability of space for all team members, especially since some are only present in the office half the time. Additionally, there is a suggestion that people might spend more time in the office than in the reading room. The team also discusses the possibility of having a coffee machine in the reading room or in the sixth floor hall.","Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.","00:04:09 - spk_2: So we only get one printer for 15 people.
00:04:12 - spk_1: Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer. Gisella has one. Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out. But just in case and theres just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The, the three person room on the right. Yeah.
00:05:16 - spk_0: And do we need a room? Like a reading room?
00:05:19 - spk_1: Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.
00:06:01 - spk_0: Mhm. The first split we can do is between administration and researcher. Yeah, I know. Its completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration. And then,



00:03:52 - spk_0: but it may be more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people. Yeah.
00:03:59 - spk_3: Yeah, it would be nicer.
00:04:02 - spk_2: And what about the reading room?
00:04:07 - spk_0:  But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading or more,
 I, I
00:04:10 - spk_2: you, I mean uh I think everybody is supposed to spend more time in the office than in the reading room. So we might think that its better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room. I dont know, it changed the plan of the morning. Im sorry, but I just realise that stupid architect put on the one windows who built this building. Do we know that? I dont know. I dunno, do you think?  I
 dunno, we spent
00:25:27 - spk_3: heart of the,
00:25:29 - spk_2: and since you n you will meet the administrator. Can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere
00:25:37 - spk_3:  in the reading room? That would be
 good.
00:25:39 - spk_2: Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine.
00:25:44 - spk_0: Its, you mean like  a little machine
 or a vending


"
Whats the maximum capacity of the rooms?,"Based on the information provided, there are rooms with a capacity of 22 people (rooms with three windows) and 32 people (rooms with no mention of the number of windows). Additionally, there are rooms with a capacity of two people. Therefore, the maximum capacity of the rooms varies depending on the size of the room.","yeah, thats a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, its quite, then everyone has an office, right? Cause its maximum 18. So take away three spaces and youre down to your 15 and youre right. If we do have a stagger or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose.","00:26:13 - spk_3: Ok, good. So,
00:26:19 - spk_0: so how many rooms and how many  places do we
 have? So we have reserved now to
00:26:27 - spk_3:  why dont I
 change it on here as well?
00:26:33 - spk_1: So thats Gisela
00:14:37 - spk_1: Yeah, I think everybody agrees on that. One person will be too small. Anyways. How about, how about this room?
00:14:44 - spk_2: The bottom? Yeah, a t the bottom in the middle with, due to the mountains? Yeah,  it has three windows. So I think its, uh,
 22. Well, which
00:14:53 - spk_1: w theres 32 person rooms,
00:14:55 - spk_2: the, the middle one  that
 has two windows. Yeah,
00:14:59 - spk_1: its, which is fine.  Its still a
 big room. Big black stripe is the windows.
00:25:56 - spk_1: Uh The building design is pretty much the same as the one we have. Now were just getting more space this way because we couldnt move in the other building because it was occupied by the other departments.



00:05:12 - spk_3: Well, lets uh how we can uh fill the three person rooms.
00:05:18 - spk_2: What, what, what, uh,
00:05:20 - spk_3: how we can, who we gonna put in the three person rooms. I mean, we have now, uh, 23 person rooms left. And, um,
00:05:32 - spk_2: no, no, but the main problem, we have the sa me number of places and the sa me number of people now. So everyone has to go somewhere. Yeah. And, uh, I just noticed that we have these two people room, we
00:05:46 - spk_0: have one  room with two windows. I
 dont mind going into this office


"

I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine.","00:25:25 - spk_1: Is the heart of the
00:25:27 - spk_3: heart of the,
00:25:29 - spk_2: and since you n you will meet the administrator. Can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere

00:25:49 - spk_2: a vending machine?



00:31:25 - spk_1:  We can bring your coffee in the reading
 room and
00:31:28 - spk_2: buying the coffee machine.
00:31:29 - spk_1: So, so since maybe youre part time here and part time, part time. A tepfl there a reat least two coffee machines in the building. One A T the third floor, one A T the first floor and we can close our coffee, no uh automatic uh coffee machine. Ok. So uh yeah,  no, theres
 the cafeterias downstairs

00:24:26 - spk_0: You know, because with mountain mountains and old town its not. No, sorry. But
00:24:32 - spk_1: Im very bad at orienting. Whereas North in Geneva, I always get it wrong. But I just assumed Nicos was talking with orientation here. Sunrise and sunshine is quite



00:05:20 - spk_3: how we can, who we gonna put in the three person rooms. I mean, we have now, uh, 23 person rooms left. And, um,
00:05:32 - spk_2: no, no, but the main problem, we have the sa me number of places and the sa me number of people now. So everyone has to go somewhere. Yeah. And, uh, I just noticed that we have these two people room, we
00:05:46 - spk_0: have one  room with two windows. I
 dont mind going into this office
00:05:50 - spk_2: you dont mind to have. Okay. So Nikos and you have to sign. Yeah, you have to find somebody agree to come with you and its not a question of you. Its a question of windows. Who would you put with you? Lets put a 50%. So,
00:06:13 - spk_1: oh, why not?
00:26:19 - spk_2: for the afternoon? Yeah, because with strong coffee, I dont sleep

Should we have two calls per week to accommodate different time zones? One on Tuesday and one on Thursday.,"Based on the information provided, it appears that there is a proposal to have two calls per week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday, in order to accommodate different time zones. This plan is open for further discussion and the specific times for the calls have not been decided yet. Therefore, it is up to the team to consider this proposal and make a decision based on any objections or considerations they may have. If there are no objections, then they may move forward with the plan while adjusting the times as needed before the next iteration of the calls.","Yes, this is the plan for now. The times are not final and can be adjusted based on feedback. The goal is to be inclusive and allow everyone to participate, even if they can't attend both calls. You can watch recordings and add points for discussion asynchronously. If the calls are not well attended, we may switch back to one call per week.","00:01:57 - spk_0: accommodate all time zones.
00:01:58 - spk_0: Um
00:02:00 - spk_0: So we were thinking about it and we were thinking about having a two times per week,
00:02:04 - spk_0: alternating time slots.
00:02:06 - spk_0: And the idea here is that we have one on a Tuesday, one on a Thursday.
00:02:11 - spk_0: And if eventually some tasks come out of Tuesday,
00:02:13 - spk_0: they could be presented the outcomes on a Thursday or vice versa.
00:06:22 - spk_0: um
00:06:24 - spk_0: unless anybody has any objections,
00:06:26 - spk_0: we would go forward with the plan of having two calls,
00:06:30 - spk_0: but the specific times still open for discussion and we
00:06:33 - spk_0: can tweak them before the next iteration of those calls.

Do the new flow charts from Patrick include the Gitaly side of things?,"Based on the provided context information, it is unclear if the new flow charts from Patrick include the Gitaly side of things. The conversation seems to focus more on whether the flow charts can be accessed from the repository and if mermaid charts are also a requirement. There is no explicit mention of Gitaly in the conversation.","No, the flow charts currently only show the ""RB that we call"" from Italy. They do not include the Gitaly client ""Tiff Stitcher"". There will be a separate call to discuss these differences once all the charts are available.","00:07:30 - spk_1: press page.
00:07:32 - spk_1: So I open an Mr to add some
00:07:34 - spk_1: basic flow charts
00:07:36 - spk_1: and
00:07:37 - spk_1: they will be
00:09:52 - spk_0: is it also achievable from the repository
00:09:56 - spk_0: to have this sort of um
00:09:58 - spk_0: flow charts?
00:10:01 - spk_3: -- Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be done. It's gonna
-- be done.
00:10:03 - spk_0: I know you, I know you're trying to squint to kind of see what's in there.
00:13:57 - spk_0: But is the target to also have a mermaid chart created out of that
00:14:01 - spk_0: ex college
00:14:02 - spk_0: flow chart?
00:14:04 - spk_2: I think Amy wanted me to make one but like I thought like me mermaid. So
00:14:09 - spk_2: didn't fancy me.

Does the current front-end mermaid chart include the file-by-file A/B mode logic?,"Based on the provided context, it appears that the current front-end mermaid chart does not include the file-by-file A/B mode logic. Speaker 0 mentions that converting the current flow chart to Mermaid might involve creating a separate Mermaid chart for the file loading logic, suggesting that these two aspects of the system are distinguished in the design.","No, the current chart does not include the file-by-file A/B mode logic. It mainly focuses on components. While a separate chart for data flow is also suggested, the priority is to first convert the existing chart to Mermaid and then iterate from there. The goal is to have a comprehensive understanding of the front-end logic, including comparisons to source code and potential for unification.","00:13:50 - spk_0: OK. We could keep uh we could give that to Thomas to cover that part of the, the flow.
00:13:56 - spk_0: Um
00:13:57 - spk_0: But is the target to also have a mermaid chart created out of that
00:14:01 - spk_0: ex college
00:14:02 - spk_0: flow chart?
00:16:17 - spk_4: Um
00:16:19 - spk_4: Right.
00:16:20 - spk_4: Did you want just to convert this to Mermaid for
00:16:23 - spk_4: the next Tuesday meeting or do you want the,
00:16:25 - spk_4: the whole front end Ds as a Mermaid?
00:16:57 - spk_0: um It reduces a lot of the logic.
00:16:59 - spk_0: It just, it's the way that the files are loaded and, and stuff like that.
00:17:03 - spk_0: Um So it might just be a separate Mermaid chart altogether.
00:17:06 - spk_0: Um
00:17:07 - spk_0: So this is a nice start to have. So

What is one new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8?,"One new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8 is the enabling of the web ID E extension marketplace for GitLab.com SAS users only in January, with plans to add it for self-managed users after that. This will allow for the use of third-party extensions within the web ID E for GitLab Pages. Additionally, improvements are being made to support slash commands.","One new feature planned for GitLab Pages in 16.8 is the ability to have multiple deployments. This will allow users to easily make changes and see what those changes are without affecting the production deployment. Additionally, a new way to add DNS to GitLab Pages without a wildcard will be available, opening up more options for users.","00:07:04 - spk_0: Um
00:07:06 - spk_0: Last week we started discussing about documenting the current implementation of
00:07:09 - spk_0: DS across Git lab
00:07:11 - spk_0: and Patrick just sort of like a status.
00:07:14 - spk_0: You have uh an update here.



00:04:55 - spk_1: We're also working on enabling the web ID E extension marketplace
00:04:59 - spk_1: uh for uh third party extensions within the web ID E.
00:05:03 - spk_1: Uh This will be enabled for GIT lab.com uh
00:05:06 - spk_1: SAS users only in January and we'll be working on
00:05:10 - spk_1: adding it for self manage users uh after that. Uh
00:25:14 - spk_5: to read those responses as they're streaming in.
00:25:16 - spk_5: This will help chat feel more performant and faster at responding to questions.
00:25:21 - spk_5: This will mirror how this works in the git lab
00:25:24 - spk_5: uh dot com U I. Today,
00:25:26 - spk_5: we're also working on improving support for slash commands
