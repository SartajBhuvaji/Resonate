And the main point that they try to get across is that theyre trying to advocate for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at an older age. Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said thats really stupid. Thats like the drug talk, like, dont do drugs, dont be on social media. Im not gonna listen to that. But then after years of kind of self reflection, I wish someone would have said you dont need Instagram to have a social  life\n",

      "00:16:51 - spk_4: You know, I just feel like its almost, its just unrealistic when I was 13, I was fully on social media making videos every single day. So I just feel like if anything, it helped me more when I was 13, like it really allowed me to just know what things were and not be so what is going on.  Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things\n",

      "00:17:21 - spk_1: Heres the thing we, we, I think were underestimating Children. Theyre relentless. We put an age limit on Instagram or an age limit on like um an adult type website. Theyre still gonna get through.\n",
      "00:17:30 - spk_3: I didnt have social media. I was probably like the last couple of people out of my like friends because my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet is. You cant control what other people are posting and you cant control what your kids are seeing. But I believe that like other kids mature at different ages and we cant really rest like restrict certain people from going on this platform when its public.\n",
      "00:17:51 - spk_5: Its difficult because I, I do think what you said is true where if I was 13 and someone said you have to be 13 to get on this app or you or like you have to be older, I would have lied about my, my age and I know there are millions of kids like that that are like, he, he, he break the system and be, like, put in a different age.  See,\n",

Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near.

So it is gonna be cringy at first and its not gonna be great.  Musically\n",

They um like told me to kill myself and told me that like, because I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself. And that I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really, really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know, like, theyre only making fun of me because Im giving them attention about it. So I just had to, like, block them from all my accounts and block all the people they were following and block all the people that were following them and then I just had to stop looking. And if I dont look at it,  then I dont know what theyre saying.\n",

You dont have control over that because its up to them to delete it.\n",
      "00:11:27 - spk_5: So I have had rude comments been made about me, but Ive never been like, heavily cyberbullied because I dont really have a big following and because of the community that Im in, Ive just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like, felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were getting.

So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?\n",

      "00:04:12 - spk_1: Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer. Gisella has one. Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out. But just in case and theres just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The, the three person room on the right. Yeah.\n",
      "00:05:16 - spk_0: And do we need a room? Like a reading room?\n",
      "00:05:19 - spk_1: Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.\n",

So we might think that its better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room. I dont know, it changed the plan of the morning.
