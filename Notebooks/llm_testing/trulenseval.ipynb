Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said thats really stupid. Thats like the drug talk, like, dont do drugs, dont be on social media. Im not gonna listen to that.

      "Query: What is a common recommendation regarding the age limit for children on social media platforms?\n",
      "Answer: A common recommendation regarding the age limit for children on social media platforms is that children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media. Some individuals believe that children should be older before they are given access to cell phones, technology, and social media platforms. However, others argue that children are relentless and will find a way to access social media regardless of age restrictions. Ultimately, the discussion highlights the importance of education and teaching children about responsible technology use.\n",
      "Context: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media. \n",
      "Ground Truth: 00:15:35 - spk_6: social media has changed your\n",
      "00:15:36 - spk_0: life 100%? I dont think I would be the person I am if it wasnt for social media. I first came out on Tik Tok and my parents didnt even know thats how they found out. Actually,\n",
      "00:15:47 - spk_6: Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media.\n",
      "00:15:58 - spk_5: Well, um its kind of funny because I talked to a lot of organizations with log off. And the main point that they try to get across is that theyre trying to advocate for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at an older age. Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said thats really stupid. Thats like the drug talk, like, dont do drugs, dont be on social media. Im not gonna listen to that. But then after years of kind of self reflection, I wish someone would have said you dont need Instagram to have a social  life\n",
      " if I go back to like my 13 year old self and like,\n",
      "00:16:25 - spk_2: I didnt have all the experiences I had and I just kind of knew like, oh, its a good place I would be posting God knows what right. Kids are dumb and if you give kids a platform to do whatever they want, theyre gonna be dumb.\n",
      "00:16:51 - spk_4: You know, I just feel like its almost, its just unrealistic when I was 13, I was fully on social media making videos every single day. So I just feel like if anything, it helped me more when I was 13, like it really allowed me to just know what things were and not be so what is going on.  Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things\n",
      " because like, I was on social media,\n",
      "00:17:07 - spk_0: like 11 years old, like I was a child and on social media and my, my dad told me he was like, you know, but youre also trans and youre also like LGBT, you know, you need to be able to meet people because your bubble that you would know of trans people would be zero.\n",
      "00:17:21 - spk_1: Heres the thing we, we, I think were underestimating Children. Theyre relentless. We put an age limit on Instagram or an age limit on like um an adult type website. Theyre still gonna get through.\n",
      "00:17:30 - spk_3: I didnt have social media. I was probably like the last couple of people out of my like friends because my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet is. You cant control what other people are posting and you cant control what your kids are seeing. But I believe that like other kids mature at different ages and we cant really rest like restrict certain people from going on this platform when its public.\n",

      "Answer: The discussion about cyberbullying included personal experiences of being bullied on social media, such as being told to kill oneself, being called names, and being made fun of for physical appearance. Participants shared how they dealt with cyberbullying, such as blocking the perpetrators, not giving them attention, and trying not to let it affect them. Some mentioned the long-lasting impact of cyberbullying, with stories of feeling suicidal and being deeply upset by rude comments. The discussion also highlighted the difference between online and in-person bullying, as well as the pressure to present a perfect image on social media platforms.\n",

And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself.

Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near.

And that I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really, really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know, like, theyre only making fun of me because Im giving them attention about it.

Some individuals mentioned wanting a reading room, and it was also noted that there should be a space left for it in the planning. Additionally, the idea of having a comfortable office versus a comfortable reading room was discussed, but ultimately, the need for a reading room was acknowledged. Therefore, it can be inferred that people do need a reading room in this context.\n",
      "Context: Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time.

Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out.

This way, tasks and outcomes can be presented on different days to ensure that all participants have the opportunity to participate and stay updated.\n",
      "Context: Yes, this is the plan for now. The times are not final and can be adjusted based on feedback. The goal is to be inclusive and allow everyone to participate, even if they can't attend both calls. You can watch recordings and add points for discussion asynchronously. If the calls are not well attended, we may switch back to one call per week. \n",

The conversation mainly focuses on creating basic flow charts and potentially using mermaid charts, but there is no specific mention of including the Gitaly side of things in the flow charts.\n",

      "Answer: Based on the provided context information, it seems that the current front-end mermaid chart does not include the file-by-file A/B mode logic. The discussion indicates that the file loading and logic are separate and may require a separate Mermaid chart altogether.\n",
      "Context: No, the current chart does not include the file-by-file A/B mode logic. It mainly focuses on components. While a separate chart for data flow is also suggested, the priority is to first convert the existing chart to Mermaid and then iterate from there.
