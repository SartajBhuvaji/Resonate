Well, the building is too small for our group. So were moving to a new building. Uh its gonna be the building across the street and were actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know whos going to be in what office in the new building and where were gon were gonna put things like the printer, the fax machine, all the big equip ment and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people in equip ment and they want to know where were going to do all of this by November 2nd. So that means basically next Tuesday. And since we dont really have any other time, we have to make these decisions today, what were getting is nine rooms for a maximum of 18 people, which is okay cause theres only 15 of us and all the rooms have windows luckily. So theres no fights about who gets a window and who doesnt. Um theres two views either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms of various sizes theres 23 people rooms, 52 person rooms, which a re on the corners of the building. So you actually get windows on two walls and 21 person rooms. Thats pretty much what the building looks like. Um, and then you have the number of people per room, the courtyard, because were on the sixth floor, you can actually go out to it, but just means that the windows look out onto open space. Um You can see the bathrooms, the elevators, a re sort of further down the hall, the purple bar, a t the bottom sort of on the right is the mail boxes, all of the windows open. You can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building. And the equipment that we have to put somewhere a re like I said, the photocopier, which is really big, a fax machine which is not so big and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack, no cupboards like we have in the current offices and each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk. So like the, the ones that we have now, um, a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small, I mean, theyre about that tall and one sort of hanging shelf. So we dont get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf thats attached to the wall and the people that we have to place. Uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organise people, whether we want to do it by rank or by project or, I dont know, put all the phd students together, all the professors together, that sort of thing. So the idea is that we come up with a plan, theres another group whos gonna be working on the same plan later this week. And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second. So I have to come up with a plan possibly if we have time, a presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best. OK. All right. So anyone have any ideas or I guess,\\n00:03:34 - spk_0: uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hole in terms of security stuff if we can?  I mean, my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hole.\\n Yeah. Um\\n00:03:49 - spk_1: I think its, the security is sort of the sa me as it is in the current building. So as long as the things a re physically attached to the wall so they cant be removed, then it should be OK to leave them in the hall. Its just a question of whether youre printing sensitive documents or whatever.\\n00:04:09 - spk_2: So we only get one printer for 15 people.\\n00:04:12 - spk_1: Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer. Gisella has one. Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out. But just in case and theres just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The, the three person room on the right. Yeah.\\n00:05:16 - spk_0: And do we need a room? Like a reading room?\\n00:05:19 - spk_1: Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.\\n00:06:01 - spk_0: Mhm. The first split we can do is between administration and researcher. Yeah, I know. Its completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration. And then,\\n00:06:18 - spk_1: yeah, but Gisela is really the only\\n00:06:22 - spk_0: administrator, a t least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other because I was thinking uh Gisela is quite, I mean, Gil Gisela s work is quite noisy because its secretary. So you get lots of phone call and stuff like that and shes always moving around. So you wont share an office with Gisela unless you a re 50% and not the 50% Gisela is working. Yeah, which is another condition  which\\n I dont know if we can assume that\\n00:06:49 - spk_1:  there isnt going to be any overlap between\\n them.\\n00:13:05 - spk_0: So we might be, it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people.  Yeah.\\n But if there a re people coming in, I mean,\\n00:13:23 - spk_3: we have these people working for two months who comes in the summer time or something. I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too. So um\\n00:13:35 - spk_1: yeah, thats a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, its quite, then everyone has an office, right? Cause its maximum 18. So take away three spaces and youre down to your 15 and youre right. If we do have a stagger or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose.\\n00:13:59 - spk_0: So the other solution is to say, OK, we use a three person room but only with two person each time and leave a spare space for. But avoiding having three person full time in the SA me room could be a good idea, I think\\n00:14:21 - spk_1: or again, find people who dont work the SA me hours. Yeah, it doesnt completely solve the problem. But\\n00:14:34 - spk_0: so for the reading room, we will have a two person room.\\n00:14:37 - spk_1: Yeah, I think everybody agrees on that. One person will be too small. Anyways. How about, how about this room?\\n00:14:44 - spk_2: The bottom? Yeah, a t the bottom in the middle with, due to the mountains? Yeah,  it has three windows. So I think its, uh,\\n 22. Well, which\\n00:14:53 - spk_1: w theres 32 person rooms,\\n00:14:55 - spk_2: the, the middle one  that\\n has two windows. Yeah,\\n00:14:59 - spk_1: its, which is fine.  Its still a\\n big room. Big black stripe is the windows.\\n00:17:35 - spk_0: or maybe right on the board. I dunno.\\n00:17:37 - spk_1: Um actually thats a good idea. Just put it up.\\n00:17:41 - spk_0: So we have the map and\\n00:17:49 - spk_1: so this really isnt to scale but oh well um thats really not to scale. Alright,  good\\n enough. Um so weve got an office there, theres two and 13. Yeah. Is that? Yeah. Yeah. Oh\\n00:18:33 - spk_0:  so ok,\\n so this is\\n00:18:38 - spk_1: that and this becomes the reading room, right?\\n00:18:41 - spk_0: Ok. Is that a? Yes. Okay.\\n00:18:59 - spk_3: And then,\\n00:19:02 - spk_0: yeah, should we decide also the administration stuff? And  so we exclude the, the thing we a re quite sure. And then we discuss\\n there,\\n00:19:12 - spk_2: I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisela into this three person office because we, we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes. Then we could have Gisela and the 2 50% people sharing the three personal\\n00:19:29 - spk_0: thats really noisy to be in the sa me office  as the administration.\\n But if\\n\\n\\n\\nConversations in meeting 'office_relocation_2':\\n00:03:40 - spk_3: Its quite dark.\\n00:03:41 - spk_0: What about moving Gisela in there? If shes in there half the time she can have her desk near the window and, ok, shes not near the mailbox but,\\n00:03:51 - spk_2: and near the photocopy,\\n00:03:52 - spk_0: but it may be more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people. Yeah.\\n00:03:59 - spk_3: Yeah, it would be nicer.\\n00:04:02 - spk_2: And what about the reading room?\\n00:04:07 - spk_0:  But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading or more,\\n I, I\\n00:04:10 - spk_2: you, I mean uh I think everybody is supposed to spend more time in the office than in the reading room. So we might think that its better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room. I dont know, it changed the plan of the morning. Im sorry, but I just realise that stupid architect put on the one windows who built this building. Do we know that? I dont know. I dunno, do you think?  I\\n dunno, we spent\\n00:04:42 - spk_1: quite some time a t the last meeting and to decide this\\n00:04:47 - spk_2: just took attention a t this one windows problem and I think it is one problem,\\n00:04:53 - spk_1: of course, but everybody had the documents before so you could have studied them. I\\n00:16:46 - spk_3: Yeah. So its quite a traffic there. I would say.\\n00:16:51 - spk_0: So what if we switch? No,\\n00:16:56 - spk_1: w will there be wireless in the building? I mean, if there a re reception hours so somebody could move to the reading room and have people,  you\\n have to have a computer with wireless. Well, isnt this the case? Doesnt everybody have  one?\\n Well, most of us, first of all have desktop computers.\\n00:17:15 - spk_2:  Plus\\n you cant assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours.\\n00:17:21 - spk_0: Right? Like people are actually using it as a reading,\\n00:17:24 - spk_3: having a room room for reading or\\n00:17:29 - spk_0: so, what can we say? Were gonna move Gisela here? Yeah. Okay. And then I think that gives usa little bit more flexibility to play with  moving people\\n around. Can we say that David\\n00:17:43 - spk_2: goes here instead of\\n00:17:47 - spk_0: you were the first one on the list? But if you wanna remove someone else?\\n00:17:50 - spk_2: No, because I was thinking of we can um, having these two office, which a re near to the lift. Keep this office for reception people. We a re pierre the two Marian and Iare receiving and Maggie and Susan, a re receiving a lot of students with, with the finish for exa MP if you want. Well, you,\\n00:18:19 - spk_0: well, you have\\n00:25:18 - spk_3: and while Jesus is kind of in the middle,\\n00:25:23 - spk_2: yeah.\\n00:25:25 - spk_1: Is the heart of the\\n00:25:27 - spk_3: heart of the,\\n00:25:29 - spk_2: and since you n you will meet the administrator. Can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere\\n00:25:37 - spk_3:  in the reading room? That would be\\n good.\\n00:25:39 - spk_2: Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine.\\n00:25:44 - spk_0: Its, you mean like  a little machine\\n or a vending\\n00:25:49 - spk_2: a vending machine?\\n00:25:51 - spk_0: The little machine I think would be harder to sell but ask for,\\n00:25:57 - spk_2: have a try\\n00:28:42 - spk_3: Well, ma mailing lists, of course you can mail em.\\n00:28:46 - spk_0: Yeah.\\n00:28:48 - spk_2: Yeah. But I mean, you have a nice poster of the next conference. You dont put it a b, a big board with,\\n00:28:58 - spk_0: um, where, like along\\n00:29:02 - spk_2: along one of the walls\\n00:29:06 - spk_3: or in front of a reading room or?\\n00:29:10 - spk_1: Yeah. Well, there a re, lots of walls we can po posters on.\\n00:29:15 - spk_0: Okay. So, along that bottom hallway somewhere. Ok. Anything else I need to ask them? No,\\n00:29:41 - spk_3: no more special. Who is this?\\n00:29:49 - spk_0: And I dont, actually we may need to sort out.\\n00:29:55 - spk_2: Mhm.\\n\\n\\n\\nConversations in meeting 'office_relocation_3':\\n00:00:48 - spk_0:  and dont forget\\n the,\\n00:00:54 - spk_1: um, so hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this meeting. Um, well, as you all know, the topic of this mornings meeting is, uh, the fact that were moving and were going to get more space. So thats a very good piece of news. Uh, but we also have to find out how we use this space. So, um, if you want, Ill just give a brief overview of whats happening and then we can, uh, talk about well, arranging these new, uh, the new office space. So, um, in case you havent seen the, the document, uh, let me just, uh, show you very briefly the, the configuration of the, the space. So, um, well, there is nothing much to say. Well, you know how many of usa reare present and you know that we a re, um, a bit tight actually in our present location. Uh Thats why actually, the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the uni building. So its a t the sixth floor and its a set of contiguous rooms as you, you can all see from uh from here. Um So the, the, the one P, two P three P means the, the number of persons as you can see we have. So a corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person rooms, two person room and, and three person rooms. Um Actually, I think Agnes did this nice drawing. So she even put the, the views. So we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the other two sides. Uh We have some bathrooms for us. Uh and the courtyard, which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down a t the,  the first floor\\n and just uh just a clarification question, a re the\\n00:02:56 - spk_2: number of people per room indicated strict or can we play around with? I mean, if there a ree two people, is it really that you cant put three or uh 2.5 or uh how, how was it?  Well,\\n its a bit difficult to say because um in fact,\\n00:03:11 - spk_1: we have some constraints in terms of furniture. Uh theyre here. So, um well, your, your person, your, your question actually is answered maybe by the third item. So each person should get. Um Well, its a sort of desk, its made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with, of course, a chair, uh, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk. Uh, and, well, we can put hanging shelves over the, the desks. So Im not really sure. Its possible to get 33 desks in a two person office. But, um, we could try whats, what should be said here. I dont know if, well, you, I, I will maybe distribute now documents if you dont have them, maybe its easier. Do you need something, Martin? We can keep this for you. Uh So its, its, yeah, you have a copy, Susan, you to David. I think so. In fact, there a re more places than people. So we wont be that constrained uh as you know, some of us and some of you here actually Martin David a re part time. So it, its for the moment, quite comfortable. Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for, you know, temporary people coming to work on uh on projects. Uh Yeah, I uh yeah, I counted so we have um 15 pers physical persons and about uh 16, I think uh persons or actually 18 persons in the offices,\\n00:04:44 - spk_2: counting the re the, the reading room.\\n00:04:46 - spk_1: Exactly. So one of the issues uh here, its probably not on the slides is that we would like to have uh unlike what we had until now a lounge or reading room. Um, I, one of the, the offices. So in one of the rooms do we really need to? Um, I think quite a lot of people express the need for that. So if we could do it, I think it would be much nicer.  Um, let me also, uh, s say something. Dont forget\\n the time we spend\\n00:05:16 - spk_2: to, for discussions about that room to be able to authorize this if possible. Yeah, I I still with you that the the we a re not so we a re not so large as far as space is concerned uh because 15 people to put in their 18 positions. So uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room, then you have  well, 1616\\n play slots for 15 people. So it still should be feasible. That also means that the growth will be zero.\\n00:05:52 - spk_1: Yeah, I think thats quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can think of. Yeah, some two or three for visiting people.\\n00:06:03 - spk_2: Mmhmm.\\n00:06:03 - spk_1: Okay. So let me finish with the the constraints which a re almost done. So we also need to, to find a, a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine and the printer, the fax you know, is very small but um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well this size um okay, the offices come with white boards, not very uh very important. Uh The furniture that each, each person has and, uh, you have a list of people. So, the thing, uh, you, you ought to know is that were not the only ones that we a re think that, that a re thinking about, uh, far, well, about putting people inin these rooms. Um, there is another group that is also having discussions. So the idea is that today well just sort of start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to, to go and think about it. Uh ask the people, you know, your assistants for instance, and A t the next meeting, well try to, to come with one solution. Uh The other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation.  So, and\\n if we dont get this space, then what happens? Uh if you, if we dont get these, um, well, basically they a re promised to us. So, uh do, do you think there a re chances that they take from us, one of the rooms or? Uh okay. Yeah. II, I think its uh\\n00:07:33 - spk_2: no, the, the, the chance it might be that there a re more people to put in that space? Yeah.\\n00:17:43 - spk_1: Well, yeah, and some of the phd students will hopefully they will finish their phd A T some point.\\n00:17:50 - spk_2: Mmhm\\n00:17:52 - spk_0: Yeah. And also some of our the people mentioned here a re working on more than one project too. So for example, Marianne the fin shes also working with me on the virtual campus project. So she that one wasnt mentioned. Im not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office. But uh its just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project.  If\\n it, if it, if projects are what you have in mind,\\n00:18:15 - spk_2: I think that the meeting room is the the tool for that you need to have people in the project talking together, they just have a meeting room. If its not too far away, then then its a very good well actu so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room.\\n00:18:28 - spk_1: But there a re also more formal meeting rooms available inin the building as  why I was\\n quite receptive to uh Susans remark. A t the beginning is\\n00:18:39 - spk_2: I wouldnt formulate it in uh such uh an extreme way as do we really need a lounge? But uh I would probably formulate it in a way that uh do we want to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room? Because, because meeting rooms to me, a re very important tools to do uh collaborative work.\\n00:18:59 - spk_1: But I think we need to have to relax. So thats, and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge,  which is a\\n whole other topic.\\n00:19:09 - spk_0: No, I um the lounge. Okay. But I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time.  So they actually have a place to work\\n cause thats really my,\\n00:19:20 - spk_2: one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that its, it pro provides no possible possibilities of expansion and this will happen. I mean, you cant, you cant prevent having visitors  and you\\n should.\\n00:19:33 - spk_1: Yeah. Yeah. For the moment, actually, I think only one slot would be fully free. Uh That is for\\n00:19:40 - spk_2:  people. Its not\\n enough.\\n00:29:02 - spk_2: everyone received that and, uh, should provide. Yeah, I would like to be here and then you will have this multi constrained problem and, uh, you work during two hours and\\n00:29:14 - spk_1: you ask people just for their place or also for the other peoples places,\\n00:29:19 - spk_2: the thing you want to know.\\n00:29:22 - spk_1:  But what\\n about the, the, the cafeteria? I mean, we a re going to pay\\n00:29:24 - spk_3: us a cafeteria with a projector and all this all together or living its all together.\\n00:29:32 - spk_2: But thats an open question. Whether its a, its a, its a, it, a t the origin, it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, uh, reading the newspapers, t cetera, et cetera. Uh, there has been a very long discussion about that. I think sh uh, this discussion is still vivid that some of the people I bel belong to these people would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure. But also a meeting room if necessary. Or as uh Susan said, a room, an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for, for, for, for work because you dont have any other place to do it. But thats, thats really an open discussion that, that I think no decision, no final.\\n00:30:12 - spk_1: Okay, then taken about that. Okay, then for the next time uh trying to come up either with your own preferences, thats quite easy probably to state now that, you know, the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be, I mean, the\\n00:30:27 - spk_2: one that I dont want you have in the next room.\\n00:30:29 - spk_1: Well, just discuss it. Yeah, for instance, I mean, no, no, I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this. And I think, yeah, it would be nice to, to come with maybe a sketch of, of these. If you can do slides, its even better. But uh dont be that formal and uh well try to a t least build up one coherent proposal and well merge it with the other one when the other one is available.\\n00:30:55 - spk_0: Ill ask um uh\\n00:30:58 - spk_1: that,\\n\\n\\n\"), HumanMessage(content=' \\nUser Query: Do people need a reading room?')]\n"

Well, the building is too small for our group. So were moving to a new building. Uh its gonna be the building across the street and were actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know whos going to be in what office in the new building and where were gon were gonna put things like the printer, the fax machine, all the big equip ment and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people in equip ment and they want to know where were going to do all of this by November 2nd. So that means basically next Tuesday. And since we dont really have any other time, we have to make these decisions today, what were getting is nine rooms for a maximum of 18 people, which is okay cause theres only 15 of us and all the rooms have windows luckily. So theres no fights about who gets a window and who doesnt. Um theres two views either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms of various sizes theres 23 people rooms, 52 person rooms, which a re on the corners of the building. So you actually get windows on two walls and 21 person rooms. Thats pretty much what the building looks like. Um, and then you have the number of people per room, the courtyard, because were on the sixth floor, you can actually go out to it, but just means that the windows look out onto open space. Um You can see the bathrooms, the elevators, a re sort of further down the hall, the purple bar, a t the bottom sort of on the right is the mail boxes, all of the windows open. You can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building. And the equipment that we have to put somewhere a re like I said, the photocopier, which is really big, a fax machine which is not so big and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack, no cupboards like we have in the current offices and each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk. So like the, the ones that we have now, um, a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small, I mean, theyre about that tall and one sort of hanging shelf. So we dont get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf thats attached to the wall and the people that we have to place. Uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organise people, whether we want to do it by rank or by project or, I dont know, put all the phd students together, all the professors together, that sort of thing. So the idea is that we come up with a plan, theres another group whos gonna be working on the same plan later this week. And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second. So I have to come up with a plan possibly if we have time, a presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best. OK. All right. So anyone have any ideas or I guess,\\n00:03:34 - spk_0: uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hole in terms of security stuff if we can?  I mean, my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hole.\\n Yeah. Um\\n00:03:49 - spk_1: I think its, the security is sort of the sa me as it is in the current building. So as long as the things a re physically attached to the wall so they cant be removed, then it should be OK to leave them in the hall. Its just a question of whether youre printing sensitive documents or whatever.\\n00:04:09 - spk_2: So we only get one printer for 15 people.\\n00:04:12 - spk_1: Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer. Gisella has one. Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out. But just in case and theres just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The, the three person room on the right. Yeah.\\n00:05:16 - spk_0: And do we need a room? Like a reading room?\\n00:05:19 - spk_1: Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.\\n00:06:01 - spk_0: Mhm. The first split we can do is between administration and researcher. Yeah, I know. Its completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration. And then,\\n00:06:18 - spk_1: yeah, but Gisela is really the only\\n00:06:22 - spk_0: administrator, a t least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other because I was thinking uh Gisela is quite, I mean, Gil Gisela s work is quite noisy because its secretary. So you get lots of phone call and stuff like that and shes always moving around. So you wont share an office with Gisela unless you a re 50% and not the 50% Gisela is working. Yeah, which is another condition  which\\n I dont know if we can assume that\\n00:06:49 - spk_1:  there isnt going to be any overlap between\\n them.\\n00:13:05 - spk_0: So we might be, it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people.  Yeah.\\n But if there a re people coming in, I mean,\\n00:13:23 - spk_3: we have these people working for two months who comes in the summer time or something. I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too. So um\\n00:13:35 - spk_1: yeah, thats a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, its quite, then everyone has an office, right? Cause its maximum 18. So take away three spaces and youre down to your 15 and youre right. If we do have a stagger or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose.\\n00:13:59 - spk_0: So the other solution is to say, OK, we use a three person room but only with two person each time and leave a spare space for. But avoiding having three person full time in the SA me room could be a good idea, I think\\n00:14:21 - spk_1: or again, find people who dont work the SA me hours. Yeah, it doesnt completely solve the problem. But\\n00:14:34 - spk_0: so for the reading room, we will have a two person room.\\n00:14:37 - spk_1: Yeah, I think everybody agrees on that. One person will be too small. Anyways. How about, how about this room?\\n00:14:44 - spk_2: The bottom? Yeah, a t the bottom in the middle with, due to the mountains? Yeah,  it has three windows. So I think its, uh,\\n 22. Well, which\\n00:14:53 - spk_1: w theres 32 person rooms,\\n00:14:55 - spk_2: the, the middle one  that\\n has two windows. Yeah,\\n00:14:59 - spk_1: its, which is fine.  Its still a\\n big room. Big black stripe is the windows.\\n00:17:35 - spk_0: or maybe right on the board. I dunno.\\n00:17:37 - spk_1: Um actually thats a good idea. Just put it up.\\n00:17:41 - spk_0: So we have the map and\\n00:17:49 - spk_1: so this really isnt to scale but oh well um thats really not to scale. Alright,  good\\n enough. Um so weve got an office there, theres two and 13. Yeah. Is that? Yeah. Yeah. Oh\\n00:18:33 - spk_0:  so ok,\\n so this is\\n00:18:38 - spk_1: that and this becomes the reading room, right?\\n00:18:41 - spk_0: Ok. Is that a? Yes. Okay.\\n00:18:59 - spk_3: And then,\\n00:19:02 - spk_0: yeah, should we decide also the administration stuff? And  so we exclude the, the thing we a re quite sure. And then we discuss\\n there,\\n00:19:12 - spk_2: I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisela into this three person office because we, we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes. Then we could have Gisela and the 2 50% people sharing the three personal\\n00:19:29 - spk_0: thats really noisy to be in the sa me office  as the administration.\\n But if\\n\\n\\n\\nConversations in meeting 'office_relocation_2':\\n00:03:40 - spk_3: Its quite dark.\\n00:03:41 - spk_0: What about moving Gisela in there? If shes in there half the time she can have her desk near the window and, ok, shes not near the mailbox but,\\n00:03:51 - spk_2: and near the photocopy,\\n00:03:52 - spk_0: but it may be more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people. Yeah.\\n00:03:59 - spk_3: Yeah, it would be nicer.\\n00:04:02 - spk_2: And what about the reading room?\\n00:04:07 - spk_0:  But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading or more,\\n I, I\\n00:04:10 - spk_2: you, I mean uh I think everybody is supposed to spend more time in the office than in the reading room. So we might think that its better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room. I dont know, it changed the plan of the morning. Im sorry, but I just realise that stupid architect put on the one windows who built this building. Do we know that? I dont know. I dunno, do you think?  I\\n dunno, we spent\\n00:04:42 - spk_1: quite some time a t the last meeting and to decide this\\n00:04:47 - spk_2: just took attention a t this one windows problem and I think it is one problem,\\n00:04:53 - spk_1: of course, but everybody had the documents before so you could have studied them. I\\n00:16:46 - spk_3: Yeah. So its quite a traffic there. I would say.\\n00:16:51 - spk_0: So what if we switch? No,\\n00:16:56 - spk_1: w will there be wireless in the building? I mean, if there a re reception hours so somebody could move to the reading room and have people,  you\\n have to have a computer with wireless. Well, isnt this the case? Doesnt everybody have  one?\\n Well, most of us, first of all have desktop computers.\\n00:17:15 - spk_2:  Plus\\n you cant assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours.\\n00:17:21 - spk_0: Right? Like people are actually using it as a reading,\\n00:17:24 - spk_3: having a room room for reading or\\n00:17:29 - spk_0: so, what can we say? Were gonna move Gisela here? Yeah. Okay. And then I think that gives usa little bit more flexibility to play with  moving people\\n around. Can we say that David\\n00:17:43 - spk_2: goes here instead of\\n00:17:47 - spk_0: you were the first one on the list? But if you wanna remove someone else?\\n00:17:50 - spk_2: No, because I was thinking of we can um, having these two office, which a re near to the lift. Keep this office for reception people. We a re pierre the two Marian and Iare receiving and Maggie and Susan, a re receiving a lot of students with, with the finish for exa MP if you want. Well, you,\\n00:18:19 - spk_0: well, you have\\n00:25:18 - spk_3: and while Jesus is kind of in the middle,\\n00:25:23 - spk_2: yeah.\\n00:25:25 - spk_1: Is the heart of the\\n00:25:27 - spk_3: heart of the,\\n00:25:29 - spk_2: and since you n you will meet the administrator. Can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere\\n00:25:37 - spk_3:  in the reading room? That would be\\n good.\\n00:25:39 - spk_2: Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine.\\n00:25:44 - spk_0: Its, you mean like  a little machine\\n or a vending\\n00:25:49 - spk_2: a vending machine?\\n00:25:51 - spk_0: The little machine I think would be harder to sell but ask for,\\n00:25:57 - spk_2: have a try\\n00:28:42 - spk_3: Well, ma mailing lists, of course you can mail em.\\n00:28:46 - spk_0: Yeah.\\n00:28:48 - spk_2: Yeah. But I mean, you have a nice poster of the next conference. You dont put it a b, a big board with,\\n00:28:58 - spk_0: um, where, like along\\n00:29:02 - spk_2: along one of the walls\\n00:29:06 - spk_3: or in front of a reading room or?\\n00:29:10 - spk_1: Yeah. Well, there a re, lots of walls we can po posters on.\\n00:29:15 - spk_0: Okay. So, along that bottom hallway somewhere. Ok. Anything else I need to ask them? No,\\n00:29:41 - spk_3: no more special. Who is this?\\n00:29:49 - spk_0: And I dont, actually we may need to sort out.\\n00:29:55 - spk_2: Mhm.\\n\\n\\n\\nConversations in meeting 'office_relocation_3':\\n00:00:48 - spk_0:  and dont forget\\n the,\\n00:00:54 - spk_1: um, so hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this meeting. Um, well, as you all know, the topic of this mornings meeting is, uh, the fact that were moving and were going to get more space. So thats a very good piece of news. Uh, but we also have to find out how we use this space. So, um, if you want, Ill just give a brief overview of whats happening and then we can, uh, talk about well, arranging these new, uh, the new office space. So, um, in case you havent seen the, the document, uh, let me just, uh, show you very briefly the, the configuration of the, the space. So, um, well, there is nothing much to say. Well, you know how many of usa reare present and you know that we a re, um, a bit tight actually in our present location. Uh Thats why actually, the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the uni building. So its a t the sixth floor and its a set of contiguous rooms as you, you can all see from uh from here. Um So the, the, the one P, two P three P means the, the number of persons as you can see we have. So a corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person rooms, two person room and, and three person rooms. Um Actually, I think Agnes did this nice drawing. So she even put the, the views. So we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the other two sides. Uh We have some bathrooms for us. Uh and the courtyard, which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down a t the,  the first floor\\n and just uh just a clarification question, a re the\\n00:02:56 - spk_2: number of people per room indicated strict or can we play around with? I mean, if there a ree two people, is it really that you cant put three or uh 2.5 or uh how, how was it?  Well,\\n its a bit difficult to say because um in fact,\\n00:03:11 - spk_1: we have some constraints in terms of furniture. Uh theyre here. So, um well, your, your person, your, your question actually is answered maybe by the third item. So each person should get. Um Well, its a sort of desk, its made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with, of course, a chair, uh, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk. Uh, and, well, we can put hanging shelves over the, the desks. So Im not really sure. Its possible to get 33 desks in a two person office. But, um, we could try whats, what should be said here. I dont know if, well, you, I, I will maybe distribute now documents if you dont have them, maybe its easier. Do you need something, Martin? We can keep this for you. Uh So its, its, yeah, you have a copy, Susan, you to David. I think so. In fact, there a re more places than people. So we wont be that constrained uh as you know, some of us and some of you here actually Martin David a re part time. So it, its for the moment, quite comfortable. Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for, you know, temporary people coming to work on uh on projects. Uh Yeah, I uh yeah, I counted so we have um 15 pers physical persons and about uh 16, I think uh persons or actually 18 persons in the offices,\\n00:04:44 - spk_2: counting the re the, the reading room.\\n00:04:46 - spk_1: Exactly. So one of the issues uh here, its probably not on the slides is that we would like to have uh unlike what we had until now a lounge or reading room. Um, I, one of the, the offices. So in one of the rooms do we really need to? Um, I think quite a lot of people express the need for that. So if we could do it, I think it would be much nicer.  Um, let me also, uh, s say something. Dont forget\\n the time we spend\\n00:05:16 - spk_2: to, for discussions about that room to be able to authorize this if possible. Yeah, I I still with you that the the we a re not so we a re not so large as far as space is concerned uh because 15 people to put in their 18 positions. So uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room, then you have  well, 1616\\n play slots for 15 people. So it still should be feasible. That also means that the growth will be zero.\\n00:05:52 - spk_1: Yeah, I think thats quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can think of. Yeah, some two or three for visiting people.\\n00:06:03 - spk_2: Mmhmm.\\n00:06:03 - spk_1: Okay. So let me finish with the the constraints which a re almost done. So we also need to, to find a, a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine and the printer, the fax you know, is very small but um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well this size um okay, the offices come with white boards, not very uh very important. Uh The furniture that each, each person has and, uh, you have a list of people. So, the thing, uh, you, you ought to know is that were not the only ones that we a re think that, that a re thinking about, uh, far, well, about putting people inin these rooms. Um, there is another group that is also having discussions. So the idea is that today well just sort of start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to, to go and think about it. Uh ask the people, you know, your assistants for instance, and A t the next meeting, well try to, to come with one solution. Uh The other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation.  So, and\\n if we dont get this space, then what happens? Uh if you, if we dont get these, um, well, basically they a re promised to us. So, uh do, do you think there a re chances that they take from us, one of the rooms or? Uh okay. Yeah. II, I think its uh\\n00:07:33 - spk_2: no, the, the, the chance it might be that there a re more people to put in that space? Yeah.\\n00:17:43 - spk_1: Well, yeah, and some of the phd students will hopefully they will finish their phd A T some point.\\n00:17:50 - spk_2: Mmhm\\n00:17:52 - spk_0: Yeah. And also some of our the people mentioned here a re working on more than one project too. So for example, Marianne the fin shes also working with me on the virtual campus project. So she that one wasnt mentioned. Im not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office. But uh its just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project.  If\\n it, if it, if projects are what you have in mind,\\n00:18:15 - spk_2: I think that the meeting room is the the tool for that you need to have people in the project talking together, they just have a meeting room. If its not too far away, then then its a very good well actu so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room.\\n00:18:28 - spk_1: But there a re also more formal meeting rooms available inin the building as  why I was\\n quite receptive to uh Susans remark. A t the beginning is\\n00:18:39 - spk_2: I wouldnt formulate it in uh such uh an extreme way as do we really need a lounge? But uh I would probably formulate it in a way that uh do we want to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room? Because, because meeting rooms to me, a re very important tools to do uh collaborative work.\\n00:18:59 - spk_1: But I think we need to have to relax. So thats, and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge,  which is a\\n whole other topic.\\n00:19:09 - spk_0: No, I um the lounge. Okay. But I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time.  So they actually have a place to work\\n cause thats really my,\\n00:19:20 - spk_2: one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that its, it pro provides no possible possibilities of expansion and this will happen. I mean, you cant, you cant prevent having visitors  and you\\n should.\\n00:19:33 - spk_1: Yeah. Yeah. For the moment, actually, I think only one slot would be fully free. Uh That is for\\n00:19:40 - spk_2:  people. Its not\\n enough.\\n00:29:02 - spk_2: everyone received that and, uh, should provide. Yeah, I would like to be here and then you will have this multi constrained problem and, uh, you work during two hours and\\n00:29:14 - spk_1: you ask people just for their place or also for the other peoples places,\\n00:29:19 - spk_2: the thing you want to know.\\n00:29:22 - spk_1:  But what\\n about the, the, the cafeteria? I mean, we a re going to pay\\n00:29:24 - spk_3: us a cafeteria with a projector and all this all together or living its all together.\\n00:29:32 - spk_2: But thats an open question. Whether its a, its a, its a, it, a t the origin, it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, uh, reading the newspapers, t cetera, et cetera. Uh, there has been a very long discussion about that. I think sh uh, this discussion is still vivid that some of the people I bel belong to these people would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure. But also a meeting room if necessary. Or as uh Susan said, a room, an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for, for, for, for work because you dont have any other place to do it. But thats, thats really an open discussion that, that I think no decision, no final.\\n00:30:12 - spk_1: Okay, then taken about that. Okay, then for the next time uh trying to come up either with your own preferences, thats quite easy probably to state now that, you know, the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be, I mean, the\\n00:30:27 - spk_2: one that I dont want you have in the next room.\\n00:30:29 - spk_1: Well, just discuss it. Yeah, for instance, I mean, no, no, I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this. And I think, yeah, it would be nice to, to come with maybe a sketch of, of these. If you can do slides, its even better. But uh dont be that formal and uh well try to a t least build up one coherent proposal and well merge it with the other one when the other one is available.\\n00:30:55 - spk_0: Ill ask um uh\\n00:30:58 - spk_1: that,\\n\\n\\n\"), HumanMessage(content=' \\nUser Query: Do people need a reading room?')], 'history': '', 'response': 'Yes, a lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so they should leave a space for that.'}\n"

Well, the building is too small for our group. So were moving to a new building. Uh its gonna be the building across the street and were actually moving in three weeks. But the problem is that the administration wants to know whos going to be in what office in the new building and where were gon were gonna put things like the printer, the fax machine, all the big equip ment and the catch is that they have the final approval of where we put people in equip ment and they want to know where were going to do all of this by November 2nd. So that means basically next Tuesday. And since we dont really have any other time, we have to make these decisions today, what were getting is nine rooms for a maximum of 18 people, which is okay cause theres only 15 of us and all the rooms have windows luckily. So theres no fights about who gets a window and who doesnt. Um theres two views either of the old town or the mountains and the rooms of various sizes theres 23 people rooms, 52 person rooms, which a re on the corners of the building. So you actually get windows on two walls and 21 person rooms. Thats pretty much what the building looks like. Um, and then you have the number of people per room, the courtyard, because were on the sixth floor, you can actually go out to it, but just means that the windows look out onto open space. Um You can see the bathrooms, the elevators, a re sort of further down the hall, the purple bar, a t the bottom sort of on the right is the mail boxes, all of the windows open. You can get out onto the terrace just like we can in our normal building. And the equipment that we have to put somewhere a re like I said, the photocopier, which is really big, a fax machine which is not so big and the printer, which is relatively big. Each office has a white board, a bulletin board and a coat rack, no cupboards like we have in the current offices and each person gets their own chair, their own corner desk. So like the, the ones that we have now, um, a small filing cabinet with three drawers and by small, I mean, theyre about that tall and one sort of hanging shelf. So we dont get the bookcases like we have now, but just one shelf thats attached to the wall and the people that we have to place. Uh you can see the list there along with their position and the project that they work on. And I guess the question, the first question is how we want to organise people, whether we want to do it by rank or by project or, I dont know, put all the phd students together, all the professors together, that sort of thing. So the idea is that we come up with a plan, theres another group whos gonna be working on the same plan later this week. And then Andre and I have to do presentations for the university administrators on the second. So I have to come up with a plan possibly if we have time, a presentation, a quick presentation with arguments for why we think our plan works best. OK. All right. So anyone have any ideas or I guess,\\n00:03:34 - spk_0: uh do we know if there will be a lot of people coming across the hole in terms of security stuff if we can?  I mean, my idea is to put the photocopier and the fax in the hole.\\n Yeah. Um\\n00:03:49 - spk_1: I think its, the security is sort of the sa me as it is in the current building. So as long as the things a re physically attached to the wall so they cant be removed, then it should be OK to leave them in the hall. Its just a question of whether youre printing sensitive documents or whatever.\\n00:04:09 - spk_2: So we only get one printer for 15 people.\\n00:04:12 - spk_1: Um, well, we get one sort of networked printer and then I think some of us have personal printers. I think Susan has a personal printer. Gisella has one. Maybe I cant remember who else. Yeah. But no one else gets their own printer in terms of equip ment. Its sort of the sa me thing as we have now. Um, so what Id propose is that we sort of discuss various concepts without getting into specifics and then go off and think about it over lunch and then come back later in the day with sort of more specific proposals as to exactly where to put people. Does that work? Oh, and on the map, the little half circular, well, quarter circles or doors, which Im assuming you figured out. But just in case and theres just the one room that actually has two doors going into it. The, the three person room on the right. Yeah.\\n00:05:16 - spk_0: And do we need a room? Like a reading room?\\n00:05:19 - spk_1: Yes. Yeah. A lot of people were saying that they wanted to have a reading room so we should leave a space for that and we cant because like I said, maximum 18 people in those rooms and theres only 15 of us and I dont know if you noticed, but two of usa re only here half the time. So Martin and David, um a re half the time A T the EPFL and half the time in Geneva. So, I sort of keep that in mind, I guess when youre doing the actual planning.\\n00:06:01 - spk_0: Mhm. The first split we can do is between administration and researcher. Yeah, I know. Its completely different work so we can deal with administration and decide something for administration. And then,\\n00:06:18 - spk_1: yeah, but Gisela is really the only\\n00:06:22 - spk_0: administrator, a t least deal with that particular situation and then see with the other because I was thinking uh Gisela is quite, I mean, Gil Gisela s work is quite noisy because its secretary. So you get lots of phone call and stuff like that and shes always moving around. So you wont share an office with Gisela unless you a re 50% and not the 50% Gisela is working. Yeah, which is another condition  which\\n I dont know if we can assume that\\n00:06:49 - spk_1:  there isnt going to be any overlap between\\n them.\\n00:13:05 - spk_0: So we might be, it might be a good idea to first exclude one of the three person room to be the reading room and not to be necessary a room with three people.  Yeah.\\n But if there a re people coming in, I mean,\\n00:13:23 - spk_3: we have these people working for two months who comes in the summer time or something. I th think we should reserve a little bit space for them too. So um\\n00:13:35 - spk_1: yeah, thats a good point because if we take the three person room out as a reading room, its quite, then everyone has an office, right? Cause its maximum 18. So take away three spaces and youre down to your 15 and youre right. If we do have a stagger or whoever comes in, then we have nowhere. Well, we can put them in the reading room but that kind of defeats the purpose.\\n00:13:59 - spk_0: So the other solution is to say, OK, we use a three person room but only with two person each time and leave a spare space for. But avoiding having three person full time in the SA me room could be a good idea, I think\\n00:14:21 - spk_1: or again, find people who dont work the SA me hours. Yeah, it doesnt completely solve the problem. But\\n00:14:34 - spk_0: so for the reading room, we will have a two person room.\\n00:14:37 - spk_1: Yeah, I think everybody agrees on that. One person will be too small. Anyways. How about, how about this room?\\n00:14:44 - spk_2: The bottom? Yeah, a t the bottom in the middle with, due to the mountains? Yeah,  it has three windows. So I think its, uh,\\n 22. Well, which\\n00:14:53 - spk_1: w theres 32 person rooms,\\n00:14:55 - spk_2: the, the middle one  that\\n has two windows. Yeah,\\n00:14:59 - spk_1: its, which is fine.  Its still a\\n big room. Big black stripe is the windows.\\n00:17:35 - spk_0: or maybe right on the board. I dunno.\\n00:17:37 - spk_1: Um actually thats a good idea. Just put it up.\\n00:17:41 - spk_0: So we have the map and\\n00:17:49 - spk_1: so this really isnt to scale but oh well um thats really not to scale. Alright,  good\\n enough. Um so weve got an office there, theres two and 13. Yeah. Is that? Yeah. Yeah. Oh\\n00:18:33 - spk_0:  so ok,\\n so this is\\n00:18:38 - spk_1: that and this becomes the reading room, right?\\n00:18:41 - spk_0: Ok. Is that a? Yes. Okay.\\n00:18:59 - spk_3: And then,\\n00:19:02 - spk_0: yeah, should we decide also the administration stuff? And  so we exclude the, the thing we a re quite sure. And then we discuss\\n there,\\n00:19:12 - spk_2: I was thinking of maybe we should assign Gisela into this three person office because we, we will probably place the printer next to the mailboxes. Then we could have Gisela and the 2 50% people sharing the three personal\\n00:19:29 - spk_0: thats really noisy to be in the sa me office  as the administration.\\n But if\\n\\n\\n\\nConversations in meeting 'office_relocation_2':\\n00:03:40 - spk_3: Its quite dark.\\n00:03:41 - spk_0: What about moving Gisela in there? If shes in there half the time she can have her desk near the window and, ok, shes not near the mailbox but,\\n00:03:51 - spk_2: and near the photocopy,\\n00:03:52 - spk_0: but it may be more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people. Yeah.\\n00:03:59 - spk_3: Yeah, it would be nicer.\\n00:04:02 - spk_2: And what about the reading room?\\n00:04:07 - spk_0:  But again, one of the reasons for putting the reading or more,\\n I, I\\n00:04:10 - spk_2: you, I mean uh I think everybody is supposed to spend more time in the office than in the reading room. So we might think that its better to have a more comfortable office than a more comfortable reading room. I dont know, it changed the plan of the morning. Im sorry, but I just realise that stupid architect put on the one windows who built this building. Do we know that? I dont know. I dunno, do you think?  I\\n dunno, we spent\\n00:04:42 - spk_1: quite some time a t the last meeting and to decide this\\n00:04:47 - spk_2: just took attention a t this one windows problem and I think it is one problem,\\n00:04:53 - spk_1: of course, but everybody had the documents before so you could have studied them. I\\n00:16:46 - spk_3: Yeah. So its quite a traffic there. I would say.\\n00:16:51 - spk_0: So what if we switch? No,\\n00:16:56 - spk_1: w will there be wireless in the building? I mean, if there a re reception hours so somebody could move to the reading room and have people,  you\\n have to have a computer with wireless. Well, isnt this the case? Doesnt everybody have  one?\\n Well, most of us, first of all have desktop computers.\\n00:17:15 - spk_2:  Plus\\n you cant assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours.\\n00:17:21 - spk_0: Right? Like people are actually using it as a reading,\\n00:17:24 - spk_3: having a room room for reading or\\n00:17:29 - spk_0: so, what can we say? Were gonna move Gisela here? Yeah. Okay. And then I think that gives usa little bit more flexibility to play with  moving people\\n around. Can we say that David\\n00:17:43 - spk_2: goes here instead of\\n00:17:47 - spk_0: you were the first one on the list? But if you wanna remove someone else?\\n00:17:50 - spk_2: No, because I was thinking of we can um, having these two office, which a re near to the lift. Keep this office for reception people. We a re pierre the two Marian and Iare receiving and Maggie and Susan, a re receiving a lot of students with, with the finish for exa MP if you want. Well, you,\\n00:18:19 - spk_0: well, you have\\n00:25:18 - spk_3: and while Jesus is kind of in the middle,\\n00:25:23 - spk_2: yeah.\\n00:25:25 - spk_1: Is the heart of the\\n00:25:27 - spk_3: heart of the,\\n00:25:29 - spk_2: and since you n you will meet the administrator. Can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere\\n00:25:37 - spk_3:  in the reading room? That would be\\n good.\\n00:25:39 - spk_2: Yeah. Or in that hall? I mean the sixth floor, theres no coffee machine.\\n00:25:44 - spk_0: Its, you mean like  a little machine\\n or a vending\\n00:25:49 - spk_2: a vending machine?\\n00:25:51 - spk_0: The little machine I think would be harder to sell but ask for,\\n00:25:57 - spk_2: have a try\\n00:28:42 - spk_3: Well, ma mailing lists, of course you can mail em.\\n00:28:46 - spk_0: Yeah.\\n00:28:48 - spk_2: Yeah. But I mean, you have a nice poster of the next conference. You dont put it a b, a big board with,\\n00:28:58 - spk_0: um, where, like along\\n00:29:02 - spk_2: along one of the walls\\n00:29:06 - spk_3: or in front of a reading room or?\\n00:29:10 - spk_1: Yeah. Well, there a re, lots of walls we can po posters on.\\n00:29:15 - spk_0: Okay. So, along that bottom hallway somewhere. Ok. Anything else I need to ask them? No,\\n00:29:41 - spk_3: no more special. Who is this?\\n00:29:49 - spk_0: And I dont, actually we may need to sort out.\\n00:29:55 - spk_2: Mhm.\\n\\n\\n\\nConversations in meeting 'office_relocation_3':\\n00:00:48 - spk_0:  and dont forget\\n the,\\n00:00:54 - spk_1: um, so hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this meeting. Um, well, as you all know, the topic of this mornings meeting is, uh, the fact that were moving and were going to get more space. So thats a very good piece of news. Uh, but we also have to find out how we use this space. So, um, if you want, Ill just give a brief overview of whats happening and then we can, uh, talk about well, arranging these new, uh, the new office space. So, um, in case you havent seen the, the document, uh, let me just, uh, show you very briefly the, the configuration of the, the space. So, um, well, there is nothing much to say. Well, you know how many of usa reare present and you know that we a re, um, a bit tight actually in our present location. Uh Thats why actually, the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the uni building. So its a t the sixth floor and its a set of contiguous rooms as you, you can all see from uh from here. Um So the, the, the one P, two P three P means the, the number of persons as you can see we have. So a corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person rooms, two person room and, and three person rooms. Um Actually, I think Agnes did this nice drawing. So she even put the, the views. So we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the other two sides. Uh We have some bathrooms for us. Uh and the courtyard, which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down a t the,  the first floor\\n and just uh just a clarification question, a re the\\n00:02:56 - spk_2: number of people per room indicated strict or can we play around with? I mean, if there a ree two people, is it really that you cant put three or uh 2.5 or uh how, how was it?  Well,\\n its a bit difficult to say because um in fact,\\n00:03:11 - spk_1: we have some constraints in terms of furniture. Uh theyre here. So, um well, your, your person, your, your question actually is answered maybe by the third item. So each person should get. Um Well, its a sort of desk, its made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with, of course, a chair, uh, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk. Uh, and, well, we can put hanging shelves over the, the desks. So Im not really sure. Its possible to get 33 desks in a two person office. But, um, we could try whats, what should be said here. I dont know if, well, you, I, I will maybe distribute now documents if you dont have them, maybe its easier. Do you need something, Martin? We can keep this for you. Uh So its, its, yeah, you have a copy, Susan, you to David. I think so. In fact, there a re more places than people. So we wont be that constrained uh as you know, some of us and some of you here actually Martin David a re part time. So it, its for the moment, quite comfortable. Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for, you know, temporary people coming to work on uh on projects. Uh Yeah, I uh yeah, I counted so we have um 15 pers physical persons and about uh 16, I think uh persons or actually 18 persons in the offices,\\n00:04:44 - spk_2: counting the re the, the reading room.\\n00:04:46 - spk_1: Exactly. So one of the issues uh here, its probably not on the slides is that we would like to have uh unlike what we had until now a lounge or reading room. Um, I, one of the, the offices. So in one of the rooms do we really need to? Um, I think quite a lot of people express the need for that. So if we could do it, I think it would be much nicer.  Um, let me also, uh, s say something. Dont forget\\n the time we spend\\n00:05:16 - spk_2: to, for discussions about that room to be able to authorize this if possible. Yeah, I I still with you that the the we a re not so we a re not so large as far as space is concerned uh because 15 people to put in their 18 positions. So uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room, then you have  well, 1616\\n play slots for 15 people. So it still should be feasible. That also means that the growth will be zero.\\n00:05:52 - spk_1: Yeah, I think thats quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can think of. Yeah, some two or three for visiting people.\\n00:06:03 - spk_2: Mmhmm.\\n00:06:03 - spk_1: Okay. So let me finish with the the constraints which a re almost done. So we also need to, to find a, a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine and the printer, the fax you know, is very small but um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well this size um okay, the offices come with white boards, not very uh very important. Uh The furniture that each, each person has and, uh, you have a list of people. So, the thing, uh, you, you ought to know is that were not the only ones that we a re think that, that a re thinking about, uh, far, well, about putting people inin these rooms. Um, there is another group that is also having discussions. So the idea is that today well just sort of start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to, to go and think about it. Uh ask the people, you know, your assistants for instance, and A t the next meeting, well try to, to come with one solution. Uh The other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation.  So, and\\n if we dont get this space, then what happens? Uh if you, if we dont get these, um, well, basically they a re promised to us. So, uh do, do you think there a re chances that they take from us, one of the rooms or? Uh okay. Yeah. II, I think its uh\\n00:07:33 - spk_2: no, the, the, the chance it might be that there a re more people to put in that space? Yeah.\\n00:17:43 - spk_1: Well, yeah, and some of the phd students will hopefully they will finish their phd A T some point.\\n00:17:50 - spk_2: Mmhm\\n00:17:52 - spk_0: Yeah. And also some of our the people mentioned here a re working on more than one project too. So for example, Marianne the fin shes also working with me on the virtual campus project. So she that one wasnt mentioned. Im not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office. But uh its just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project.  If\\n it, if it, if projects are what you have in mind,\\n00:18:15 - spk_2: I think that the meeting room is the the tool for that you need to have people in the project talking together, they just have a meeting room. If its not too far away, then then its a very good well actu so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room.\\n00:18:28 - spk_1: But there a re also more formal meeting rooms available inin the building as  why I was\\n quite receptive to uh Susans remark. A t the beginning is\\n00:18:39 - spk_2: I wouldnt formulate it in uh such uh an extreme way as do we really need a lounge? But uh I would probably formulate it in a way that uh do we want to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room? Because, because meeting rooms to me, a re very important tools to do uh collaborative work.\\n00:18:59 - spk_1: But I think we need to have to relax. So thats, and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge,  which is a\\n whole other topic.\\n00:19:09 - spk_0: No, I um the lounge. Okay. But I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time.  So they actually have a place to work\\n cause thats really my,\\n00:19:20 - spk_2: one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that its, it pro provides no possible possibilities of expansion and this will happen. I mean, you cant, you cant prevent having visitors  and you\\n should.\\n00:19:33 - spk_1: Yeah. Yeah. For the moment, actually, I think only one slot would be fully free. Uh That is for\\n00:19:40 - spk_2:  people. Its not\\n enough.\\n00:29:02 - spk_2: everyone received that and, uh, should provide. Yeah, I would like to be here and then you will have this multi constrained problem and, uh, you work during two hours and\\n00:29:14 - spk_1: you ask people just for their place or also for the other peoples places,\\n00:29:19 - spk_2: the thing you want to know.\\n00:29:22 - spk_1:  But what\\n about the, the, the cafeteria? I mean, we a re going to pay\\n00:29:24 - spk_3: us a cafeteria with a projector and all this all together or living its all together.\\n00:29:32 - spk_2: But thats an open question. Whether its a, its a, its a, it, a t the origin, it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, uh, reading the newspapers, t cetera, et cetera. Uh, there has been a very long discussion about that. I think sh uh, this discussion is still vivid that some of the people I bel belong to these people would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure. But also a meeting room if necessary. Or as uh Susan said, a room, an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for, for, for, for work because you dont have any other place to do it. But thats, thats really an open discussion that, that I think no decision, no final.\\n00:30:12 - spk_1: Okay, then taken about that. Okay, then for the next time uh trying to come up either with your own preferences, thats quite easy probably to state now that, you know, the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be, I mean, the\\n00:30:27 - spk_2: one that I dont want you have in the next room.\\n00:30:29 - spk_1: Well, just discuss it. Yeah, for instance, I mean, no, no, I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this. And I think, yeah, it would be nice to, to come with maybe a sketch of, of these. If you can do slides, its even better. But uh dont be that formal and uh well try to a t least build up one coherent proposal and well merge it with the other one when the other one is available.\\n00:30:55 - spk_0: Ill ask um uh\\n00:30:58 - spk_1: that,\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

This is Laney Belmonte. She is going to provide you with the employer perspective. Um As I said, shes the director of Human Resources. So thinking through what would a potential employer be looking for. So go ahead, Laney. Oh, she might be on mute. Think you might be on mute. Laney, I can meet you.\\n00:20:55 - spk_4: There you go.\\n00:20:56 - spk_3: Hows that?\\n00:20:57 - spk_5: Ok. So hello everyone. Im glad to see so many of you interested in health care. Um I work in human resources at Premier Medical Group. And uh one of the things we do in human resources is we hire people. Um So in that premiere, we have many different uh types of health care positions from those support positions that we were talking about um through to many of the technical positions. And one of the questions we might ask someone, you know, in an interview when theyre interviewing for a job is what led you to the career of being in health care. So I wanna talk to you about reasons you might think you want to be in health care. So one reason is you like working with people um or youre very compassionate and you, you like caring for people. Uh or you like science, youve enjoyed your science classes, you like uh the research involved, youre very analytical. Um you like to solve problems. Uh That might be another reason why job stability, there is a lot of job stability in health care. Um People are gonna continue to have Children and babies. Um Unfortunately, illnesses um are inevitable. Uh So theres, theres always gonna be a need for that personal care. Uh and health care workers, our population is growing. So um with, with the growing population, uh the demand for health care workers is increasing. So many health care positions are well paid um as the demand increases for healthcare workers typically. So do the, the, the salaries, health care careers are really diverse. You can, uh go into just general medicine. Uh, you can choose to go into a specialty. Uh, you know, here at premiere, we have many specialties, uh, you know, on the slide here it says foot, mouth, heart lungs. So a podiatrist is someone who specializes with feet. A cardiologist would specialize with, um, with issues of the heart. Uh Then theres also the administrative and management side. So we have medical billing people that are, they, theyre not clinical people who are doing hands on uh patient care, but theyre still in health care and they do uh billing or marketing or human resources. So theres, theres other admin of options in health care as well. So the the good news is theres lots of choices, there are many choices in the field of health care. Uh Some that require 1 to 2 years of advanced study after high school. Uh Some that might require uh four years of study or, or more and typically your, your income will increase the more education you have. So what can you guys do now to prepare for a career in health care? One is to finish high school, get your diploma. So thats, thats the first thing that you need to do. Um start doing some research, Google stuff. Look online, talk to your guidance counselors, talk to your parents, um perhaps talk to a healthcare professional whos doing the job, find out what their day to day is like, what they like, what they dislike. Um Those are all things that you can do to sort of explore this, this um this field of study and try to gain some experience. There might be some internships out there. Uh Oftentimes you can shadow a health care professional. Um Weve done that here. Ive had a couple of people come through here and uh just come in for a day and shadow someone to see what its like to work uh in a particular uh position. Um We also have hired people just for summer jobs, you know, so you get a flavor of, you know, what its like to even be in the healthcare environment. Uh Theres some volunteer opportunities. Uh Sometimes the nursing homes in the hospitals have volunteer hos uh opportunities. So, um so the good news is, its, its very diverse. Um Healthcare can be a really rewarding career. Um I have a couple of resources here that uh I just want you to take a quick look at because this, this could be part of your research. Um Louise, if you can, you click on that first link\\n00:25:54 - spk_4:  and Laney while were\\r\\n waiting for Louise to bring up that page.\\n00:25:57 - spk_0: A question came in from Rebecca asking if theres um  um uh a minimum\\r\\n age that you need to be in order to do shadowing.\\n00:26:07 - spk_5: So, uh we typically have uh I would say you know, 17, probably 17 and above.\\n00:26:18 - spk_3: Great, great.\\n00:26:21 - spk_5: Uh So this is uh US news and its best health care jobs. These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before. Uh th those that typically require more education. So you can see well just for, you know, demonstration purposes. Um You can see, uh Im sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen. Is there a way to maybe I can just click it off. Thank you.\\n00:26:48 - spk_3: I have it.  I\\r\\n got it.\\n00:26:57 - spk_5: So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes its a little\\n00:27:05 - spk_3: switch back and forth but were waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit? Um Some of our students arent familiar with that term.\\n00:27:13 - spk_5: Sure. So shadowing is where you, you might come in. Um, maybe youre gonna shadow another medical assistant for the day. Uh You might sit and talk with her and find out what shes doing whether shes doing something in the computer. Um, you know, in health care theres um, theres privacy issues with patients so there might be limited. Um, you know, it may be limited in terms of what you are able to know about a patient, but you can get a sense of, you know, follow them around, see what theyre doing, watch them take a blood pressure, um, you know, watch them, uh do vital signs, things of that nature. So the, uh, the resource thats there. There we go. So this is the one that has more technical jobs. Um, if we look down a little bit, you see the number one, these are, uh, the technical jobs that are ranked, you know, dentist is ranked number one, a physician assistant, number two. but what I wanna point out is one, itll describe a little bit about what that job is. If you click on the read more and then, uh, Louise, if you could just go down just a little bit and the o just up a little bit, there we go right there. Um, oh, I think it was on the first, the first page. Maybe go just that one. Ok. So you can see there on the right hand side, it will say the number of projected jobs in that field. So for example, physician assistant, it says theres 37,000 projected jobs. The median salary is 100 and 8000 and change. The education required is a masters degree. So this is a quick resource that you can use to look at different kinds of jobs. Get a sense of how much schooling youd have to do, how many jobs are out there in that field. And whats the salary. So, um, um, the second link and, and you, you can either pull that up or if its being difficult, Louise, I can just speak to it. Um, the other link thats on the first page.\\n00:29:41 - spk_1: Can, can you see it? Did it change for you guys? If not, Ill stop sharing with you. You  have to stop in the beach here,\\r\\n let me\\n00:29:49 - spk_2: of the three share.\\n00:29:54 - spk_5: So uh this is another link from US news. Now this is more those the support positions uh that we were talking about. So these typically require less schooling. Um not all but some uh physical therapy assistant you see here, number three and again, on the right, you can see the projected number of jobs, the median salary and uh that this particular job requires an associates degree. So again, this is another um just another resource for you to use where you can quickly get a description of what the job is. See if there are lots of jobs or very little jobs available, what the median salaries are and what uh what education requirements there are for the position.\\n00:30:48 - spk_3: Great. And uh\\n00:30:49 - spk_4: la would you mind?  Theres just two,\\r\\n two questions that came in um And your, your advice would be great.  Um A\\r\\n student was asking the best  way to\\r\\n um find out about an opportunity to shadow.\\n00:31:02 - spk_0: Should they reach out directly to different health care? Should they go through their guidance counselor?  What would be the best way for them\\r\\n to do that?\\n00:31:10 - spk_3:  Well, if the,\\r\\n if the school has any connections uh with different um health care\\n00:31:18 - spk_5: uh facilities, that might be the best way then they can advocate for those students. Um If in the absence of those, the student can uh try to contact someone at the organization. Um but it is probably better to have um  an\\r\\n advocate,\\n00:31:37 - spk_3: right? And I think like, um I can speak from the the school perspective, work based learning would be the a great way to do that. So for our district right now, Mrs Noy is in charge of the work based learning program. So if thats something um you can work with your guidance counselor to make sure you have work based learning on uh your schedule and then get in contact with Mrs Noy and, and she can uh work with you on different ways uh to reach out to the different agencies. And I know another student had asked about an internship with a um with a dietitian or nutritionist. And I would say that that would work the same way from our perspective, working at the schools. Although they probably could reach out to um a specific person that is in that field. Is that good for a second question that I it was kind of both of them. They were very Oh yeah. So is that, is that it for you, Miss Brown?  That is it\\r\\n for me? Unless anyone has any questions, Im happy to um answer them. Ok. And what we might do is well let um M Ingham go ahead and then we can have questions across the board for everyone because I wanna make that we do have time for, um, Miss Karen Ingham to speak from Dutchess Community College. So Im gonna turn it over to her and just keep putting your questions in the chat. Ill try to get to them, um, and, and bring them on to the end if we, if we have time. Go ahead, Karen.  All right. Well,\\r\\n thank you everybody. Its a pleasure to be here this afternoon.\\n00:33:08 - spk_6: Um Im here to talk a little bit about um what you might wanna think about doing when youre still in high school to prepare you for entry at the college level and uh not just community college. I mean, were an excellent choice. Um We have a low tuition and we do offer a variety of allied health programs you can see on the screen, the college offers offers programs that might take perhaps two semesters to complete. So those that are certificate programs are either a semester or two in length if youre a full time student. Um and then we have programs that are designed for you to go directly into the workforce. So if youre interested in perhaps um becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT, um if youre interested in, if you like working in the in health care, but not sure you wanna have direct patient care, you might think about something like clinical lab technician. Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license, once you complete your programs here at Dutchess, youre eligible to take the state licensing exams. And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh, the employment opportunities will basically, you know, hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse. If youre interested in transferring to a four year school, youre interested. I, I looked at the list people, a lot of people wanted to be doctors and physical therapists and nurses and, um, all those high level jobs. I mean, Dutchess is a great place to start. Even if youre thinking, um, you know, you know, for sure you wanna continue on. It really doesnt matter where you start, but it matters where you finish. So we are an excellent choice, especially during, um, online teaching. You know, when maybe you want to be the next Doctor Fauci, we have a public health program, um, that is articulated with Suny Albany, which means you can take the two years, uh, of courses, full time at Dutchess and all of your credits will transfer to University of Albany. So you can complete and get your bachelors degree in public health or you may choose to stay and get your masters in public health. Um, so there are a lot of opportunities we also have, um, what we call the Liberal Arts science pathway. So if you do wanna be that physical therapist, you wanna be that, um, dentist, you wanna be the doctor. You wanna be the occupational therapist. You can again, start at dutchess. Get two years of education, take all your sciences, your general education that you would normally take at a four year school as a freshman or a sophomore. And then those credits transfer, um, to your institutions. We have students who transfer all over the place. Um, they may, a lot of them go to Suny Binghamton. It has an excellent science reputation. Suny Stony Brook, Suny, New Paul University of Albany. And of course, Marist, uh Mount Saint Marys. Um, we have hi and the students who go through dutchess and transfer, they have a very high success rate. Once they transfer, our studies have shown that um our graduates typically uh do better at a four year institution than other transfer students as well as some of their original students that started there as a freshman. So right in your, in your neighborhood, you know, youve got Duchess and, and some of our tech jobs, you know, a semester, two years, four years, I mean, you can just keep building on as was already mentioned. And then before you know, it, um you can be out there doing what you hope to do while youre in high school. Im gonna tell you probably the same thing your mother has told you. Your father has told you, your guidance counselors have told you and your teachers have told you if you are interested in health care, you need to work hard at the sciences, your biology classes, if youre lucky enough and you, maybe youre doing a P biology, maybe with Miss Glancy or Missus mcfarland. I mean, youre gonna walk out and youre gonna do very well when you get to your, your, your institution of choice. Um, but, um, you know, continue with your chemistry, continue with your math. Um, you really want to make sure you have sharp skills because thats not gonna go away as you enter into, um, the courses at the college level. You also want to try to be mindful about your senior year. I know its senioritis kicks in but you want to m make sure that you are challenging yourself, pick courses. I mean, obviously any courses that you need to get your diploma, but if you have the opportunity to take those challenging courses, those A P courses, if thats a recommendation, we would highly recommend that you do that. You wanna show your, um, your college as you go through the admission process that, um, youre not afraid of hard course work. Um, they dont necessarily like to see a whole bunch of electives. Electives are great, right? Because how do you know what you wanna do? I know theres seventh graders, eighth graders, ninth graders, everyones here today. Very few people know for sure what they wanna do. Or even if they think they know what they wanna do, they might still end up changing their mind. And so by taking an elective, maybe a computer class or, or maybe a forensic science class, something outside of your normal, uh, course options. Who knows? That experience might, might help you really fine tune what you wanna study at your, at your institution. Um, and then if youre worried about your ranking, if youre taking an A P class, if you get a B plus in a college level biology class, OK. Put that in your essay. You know, I, I chose to challenge myself. Um I took college level calculus. I chose to challenge myself in my senior year or my junior year because I think its important to, you know, if Im capable, I should, I should try to do it and uh you know, get position yourself, you know, for that, for that uh transfer to the four year school. Um Anything else? Amy? I dont wanna, I, Im just looking at the time I wanna give opportunity for, for everyone to ask questions.\\n\\n\\n\"), HumanMessage(content=' \\nUser Query: Whats the minimum age that you need to be in order to do shadowing')]\n",

If you click on the read more and then, uh, Louise, if you could just go down just a little bit and the o just up a little bit, there we go right there. Um, oh, I think it was on the first, the first page. Maybe go just that one. Ok. So you can see there on the right hand side, it will say the number of projected jobs in that field. So for example, physician assistant, it says theres 37,000 projected jobs. The median salary is 100 and 8000 and change. The education required is a masters degree. So this is a quick resource that you can use to look at different kinds of jobs. Get a sense of how much schooling youd have to do, how many jobs are out there in that field. And whats the salary. So, um, um, the second link and, and you, you can either pull that up or if its being difficult, Louise, I can just speak to it. Um, the other link thats on the first page.\\n00:29:41 - spk_1: Can, can you see it? Did it change for you guys? If not, Ill stop sharing with you. You  have to stop in the beach here,\\r\\n let me\\n00:29:49 - spk_2: of the three share.\\n00:29:54 - spk_5: So uh this is another link from US news. Now this is more those the support positions uh that we were talking about. So these typically require less schooling. Um not all but some uh physical therapy assistant you see here, number three and again, on the right, you can see the projected number of jobs, the median salary and uh that this particular job requires an associates degree. So again, this is another um just another resource for you to use where you can quickly get a description of what the job is. See if there are lots of jobs or very little jobs available, what the median salaries are and what uh what education requirements there are for the position.\\n00:30:48 - spk_3: Great. And uh\\n00:30:49 - spk_4: la would you mind?  Theres just two,\\r\\n two questions that came in um And your, your advice would be great.  Um A\\r\\n student was asking the best  way to\\r\\n um find out about an opportunity to shadow.\\n00:31:02 - spk_0: Should they reach out directly to different health care? Should they go through their guidance counselor?  What would be the best way for them\\r\\n to do that?\\n00:31:10 - spk_3:  Well, if the,\\r\\n if the school has any connections uh with different um health care\\n00:31:18 - spk_5: uh facilities, that might be the best way then they can advocate for those students. Um If in the absence of those, the student can uh try to contact someone at the organization. Um but it is probably better to have um  an\\r\\n advocate,\\n00:31:37 - spk_3: right? And I think like, um I can speak from the the school perspective, work based learning would be the a great way to do that. So for our district right now, Mrs Noy is in charge of the work based learning program. So if thats something um you can work with your guidance counselor to make sure you have work based learning on uh your schedule and then get in contact with Mrs Noy and, and she can uh work with you on different ways uh to reach out to the different agencies. And I know another student had asked about an internship with a um with a dietitian or nutritionist. And I would say that that would work the same way from our perspective, working at the schools. Although they probably could reach out to um a specific person that is in that field. Is that good for a second question that I it was kind of both of them. They were very Oh yeah. So is that, is that it for you, Miss Brown?  That is it\\r\\n for me? Unless anyone has any questions, Im happy to um answer them. Ok. And what we might do is well let um M Ingham go ahead and then we can have questions across the board for everyone because I wanna make that we do have time for, um, Miss Karen Ingham to speak from Dutchess Community College. So Im gonna turn it over to her and just keep putting your questions in the chat. Ill try to get to them, um, and, and bring them on to the end if we, if we have time. Go ahead, Karen.  All right. Well,\\r\\n thank you everybody. Its a pleasure to be here this afternoon.\\n00:33:08 - spk_6: Um Im here to talk a little bit about um what you might wanna think about doing when youre still in high school to prepare you for entry at the college level and uh not just community college. I mean, were an excellent choice. Um We have a low tuition and we do offer a variety of allied health programs you can see on the screen, the college offers offers programs that might take perhaps two semesters to complete. So those that are certificate programs are either a semester or two in length if youre a full time student. Um and then we have programs that are designed for you to go directly into the workforce. So if youre interested in perhaps um becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT, um if youre interested in, if you like working in the in health care, but not sure you wanna have direct patient care, you might think about something like clinical lab technician. Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license, once you complete your programs here at Dutchess, youre eligible to take the state licensing exams. And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh, the employment opportunities will basically, you know, hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse. If youre interested in transferring to a four year school, youre interested. I, I looked at the list people, a lot of people wanted to be doctors and physical therapists and nurses and, um, all those high level jobs. I mean, Dutchess is a great place to start. Even if youre thinking, um, you know, you know, for sure you wanna continue on. It really doesnt matter where you start, but it matters where you finish. So we are an excellent choice, especially during, um, online teaching. You know, when maybe you want to be the next Doctor Fauci, we have a public health program, um, that is articulated with Suny Albany, which means you can take the two years, uh, of courses, full time at Dutchess and all of your credits will transfer to University of Albany. So you can complete and get your bachelors degree in public health or you may choose to stay and get your masters in public health. Um, so there are a lot of opportunities we also have, um, what we call the Liberal Arts science pathway. So if you do wanna be that physical therapist, you wanna be that, um, dentist, you wanna be the doctor. You wanna be the occupational therapist. You can again, start at dutchess. Get two years of education, take all your sciences, your general education that you would normally take at a four year school as a freshman or a sophomore. And then those credits transfer, um, to your institutions. We have students who transfer all over the place. Um, they may, a lot of them go to Suny Binghamton. It has an excellent science reputation. Suny Stony Brook, Suny, New Paul University of Albany. And of course, Marist, uh Mount Saint Marys. Um, we have hi and the students who go through dutchess and transfer, they have a very high success rate. Once they transfer, our studies have shown that um our graduates typically uh do better at a four year institution than other transfer students as well as some of their original students that started there as a freshman. So right in your, in your neighborhood, you know, youve got Duchess and, and some of our tech jobs, you know, a semester, two years, four years, I mean, you can just keep building on as was already mentioned. And then before you know, it, um you can be out there doing what you hope to do while youre in high school. Im gonna tell you probably the same thing your mother has told you. Your father has told you, your guidance counselors have told you and your teachers have told you if you are interested in health care, you need to work hard at the sciences, your biology classes, if youre lucky enough and you, maybe youre doing a P biology, maybe with Miss Glancy or Missus mcfarland. I mean, youre gonna walk out and youre gonna do very well when you get to your, your, your institution of choice. Um, but, um, you know, continue with your chemistry, continue with your math. Um, you really want to make sure you have sharp skills because thats not gonna go away as you enter into, um, the courses at the college level. You also want to try to be mindful about your senior year. I know its senioritis kicks in but you want to m make sure that you are challenging yourself, pick courses. I mean, obviously any courses that you need to get your diploma, but if you have the opportunity to take those challenging courses, those A P courses, if thats a recommendation, we would highly recommend that you do that. You wanna show your, um, your college as you go through the admission process that, um, youre not afraid of hard course work. Um, they dont necessarily like to see a whole bunch of electives. Electives are great, right? Because how do you know what you wanna do? I know theres seventh graders, eighth graders, ninth graders, everyones here today. Very few people know for sure what they wanna do. Or even if they think they know what they wanna do, they might still end up changing their mind. And so by taking an elective, maybe a computer class or, or maybe a forensic science class, something outside of your normal, uh, course options. Who knows? That experience might, might help you really fine tune what you wanna study at your, at your institution. Um, and then if youre worried about your ranking, if youre taking an A P class, if you get a B plus in a college level biology class, OK. Put that in your essay. You know, I, I chose to challenge myself. Um I took college level calculus. I chose to challenge myself in my senior year or my junior year because I think its important to, you know, if Im capable, I should, I should try to do it and uh you know, get position yourself, you know, for that, for that uh transfer to the four year school. Um Anything else? Amy? I dont wanna, I, Im just looking at the time I wanna give opportunity for, for everyone to ask questions.\\n\\n\\n\"), HumanMessage(content=' \\nUser Query: Whats the minimum age that you need to be in order to do shadowing')], 'history': 'System: The human provides a context of a meeting related to healthcare careers.

This is Laney Belmonte. She is going to provide you with the employer perspective. Um As I said, shes the director of Human Resources. So thinking through what would a potential employer be looking for. So go ahead, Laney. Oh, she might be on mute. Think you might be on mute. Laney, I can meet you.\\n00:20:55 - spk_4: There you go.\\n00:20:56 - spk_3: Hows that?\\n00:20:57 - spk_5: Ok. So hello everyone. Im glad to see so many of you interested in health care. Um I work in human resources at Premier Medical Group. And uh one of the things we do in human resources is we hire people. Um So in that premiere, we have many different uh types of health care positions from those support positions that we were talking about um through to many of the technical positions. And one of the questions we might ask someone, you know, in an interview when theyre interviewing for a job is what led you to the career of being in health care. So I wanna talk to you about reasons you might think you want to be in health care. So one reason is you like working with people um or youre very compassionate and you, you like caring for people. Uh or you like science, youve enjoyed your science classes, you like uh the research involved, youre very analytical. Um you like to solve problems. Uh That might be another reason why job stability, there is a lot of job stability in health care. Um People are gonna continue to have Children and babies. Um Unfortunately, illnesses um are inevitable. Uh So theres, theres always gonna be a need for that personal care. Uh and health care workers, our population is growing. So um with, with the growing population, uh the demand for health care workers is increasing. So many health care positions are well paid um as the demand increases for healthcare workers typically. So do the, the, the salaries, health care careers are really diverse. You can, uh go into just general medicine. Uh, you can choose to go into a specialty. Uh, you know, here at premiere, we have many specialties, uh, you know, on the slide here it says foot, mouth, heart lungs. So a podiatrist is someone who specializes with feet. A cardiologist would specialize with, um, with issues of the heart. Uh Then theres also the administrative and management side. So we have medical billing people that are, they, theyre not clinical people who are doing hands on uh patient care, but theyre still in health care and they do uh billing or marketing or human resources. So theres, theres other admin of options in health care as well. So the the good news is theres lots of choices, there are many choices in the field of health care. Uh Some that require 1 to 2 years of advanced study after high school. Uh Some that might require uh four years of study or, or more and typically your, your income will increase the more education you have. So what can you guys do now to prepare for a career in health care? One is to finish high school, get your diploma. So thats, thats the first thing that you need to do. Um start doing some research, Google stuff. Look online, talk to your guidance counselors, talk to your parents, um perhaps talk to a healthcare professional whos doing the job, find out what their day to day is like, what they like, what they dislike. Um Those are all things that you can do to sort of explore this, this um this field of study and try to gain some experience. There might be some internships out there. Uh Oftentimes you can shadow a health care professional. Um Weve done that here. Ive had a couple of people come through here and uh just come in for a day and shadow someone to see what its like to work uh in a particular uh position. Um We also have hired people just for summer jobs, you know, so you get a flavor of, you know, what its like to even be in the healthcare environment. Uh Theres some volunteer opportunities. Uh Sometimes the nursing homes in the hospitals have volunteer hos uh opportunities. So, um so the good news is, its, its very diverse. Um Healthcare can be a really rewarding career. Um I have a couple of resources here that uh I just want you to take a quick look at because this, this could be part of your research. Um Louise, if you can, you click on that first link\\n00:25:54 - spk_4:  and Laney while were\\r\\n waiting for Louise to bring up that page.\\n00:25:57 - spk_0: A question came in from Rebecca asking if theres um  um uh a minimum\\r\\n age that you need to be in order to do shadowing.\\n00:26:07 - spk_5: So, uh we typically have uh I would say you know, 17, probably 17 and above.\\n00:26:18 - spk_3: Great, great.\\n00:26:21 - spk_5: Uh So this is uh US news and its best health care jobs. These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before. Uh th those that typically require more education. So you can see well just for, you know, demonstration purposes. Um You can see, uh Im sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen. Is there a way to maybe I can just click it off. Thank you.\\n00:26:48 - spk_3: I have it.  I\\r\\n got it.\\n00:26:57 - spk_5: So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes its a little\\n00:27:05 - spk_3: switch back and forth but were waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit? Um Some of our students arent familiar with that term.\\n00:27:13 - spk_5: Sure. So shadowing is where you, you might come in. Um, maybe youre gonna shadow another medical assistant for the day. Uh You might sit and talk with her and find out what shes doing whether shes doing something in the computer. Um, you know, in health care theres um, theres privacy issues with patients so there might be limited. Um, you know, it may be limited in terms of what you are able to know about a patient, but you can get a sense of, you know, follow them around, see what theyre doing, watch them take a blood pressure, um, you know, watch them, uh do vital signs, things of that nature. So the, uh, the resource thats there. There we go. So this is the one that has more technical jobs. Um, if we look down a little bit, you see the number one, these are, uh, the technical jobs that are ranked, you know, dentist is ranked number one, a physician assistant, number two. but what I wanna point out is one, itll describe a little bit about what that job is. If you click on the read more and then, uh, Louise, if you could just go down just a little bit and the o just up a little bit, there we go right there. Um, oh, I think it was on the first, the first page. Maybe go just that one. Ok. So you can see there on the right hand side, it will say the number of projected jobs in that field. So for example, physician assistant, it says theres 37,000 projected jobs. The median salary is 100 and 8000 and change. The education required is a masters degree. So this is a quick resource that you can use to look at different kinds of jobs. Get a sense of how much schooling youd have to do, how many jobs are out there in that field. And whats the salary. So, um, um, the second link and, and you, you can either pull that up or if its being difficult, Louise, I can just speak to it. Um, the other link thats on the first page.\\n00:29:41 - spk_1: Can, can you see it? Did it change for you guys? If not, Ill stop sharing with you. You  have to stop in the beach here,\\r\\n let me\\n00:29:49 - spk_2: of the three share.\\n00:29:54 - spk_5: So uh this is another link from US news. Now this is more those the support positions uh that we were talking about. So these typically require less schooling. Um not all but some uh physical therapy assistant you see here, number three and again, on the right, you can see the projected number of jobs, the median salary and uh that this particular job requires an associates degree. So again, this is another um just another resource for you to use where you can quickly get a description of what the job is. See if there are lots of jobs or very little jobs available, what the median salaries are and what uh what education requirements there are for the position.\\n00:30:48 - spk_3: Great. And uh\\n00:30:49 - spk_4: la would you mind?  Theres just two,\\r\\n two questions that came in um And your, your advice would be great.  Um A\\r\\n student was asking the best  way to\\r\\n um find out about an opportunity to shadow.\\n00:31:02 - spk_0: Should they reach out directly to different health care? Should they go through their guidance counselor?  What would be the best way for them\\r\\n to do that?\\n00:31:10 - spk_3:  Well, if the,\\r\\n if the school has any connections uh with different um health care\\n00:31:18 - spk_5: uh facilities, that might be the best way then they can advocate for those students. Um If in the absence of those, the student can uh try to contact someone at the organization. Um but it is probably better to have um  an\\r\\n advocate,\\n00:31:37 - spk_3: right?

So if youre interested in perhaps um becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT, um if youre interested in, if you like working in the in health care, but not sure you wanna have direct patient care, you might think about something like clinical lab technician. Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license, once you complete your programs here at Dutchess, youre eligible to take the state licensing exams. And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh, the employment opportunities will basically, you know, hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse.

And I think like, um I can speak from the the school perspective, work based learning would be the a great way to do that. So for our district right now, Mrs Noy is in charge of the work based learning program. So if thats something um you can work with your guidance counselor to make sure you have work based learning on uh your schedule and then get in contact with Mrs Noy and, and she can uh work with you on different ways uh to reach out to the different agencies. And I know another student had asked about an internship with a um with a dietitian or nutritionist. And I would say that that would work the same way from our perspective, working at the schools. Although they probably could reach out to um a specific person that is in that field. Is that good for a second question that I it was kind of both of them. They were very Oh yeah. So is that, is that it for you, Miss Brown?  That is it\\r\\n for me? Unless anyone has any questions, Im happy to um answer them. Ok. And what we might do is well let um M Ingham go ahead and then we can have questions across the board for everyone because I wanna make that we do have time for, um, Miss Karen Ingham to speak from Dutchess Community College. So Im gonna turn it over to her and just keep putting your questions in the chat. Ill try to get to them, um, and, and bring them on to the end if we, if we have time. Go ahead, Karen.  All right. Well,\\r\\n thank you everybody. Its a pleasure to be here this afternoon.\\n00:33:08 - spk_6: Um Im here to talk a little bit about um what you might wanna think about doing when youre still in high school to prepare you for entry at the college level and uh not just community college. I mean, were an excellent choice. Um We have a low tuition and we do offer a variety of allied health programs you can see on the screen, the college offers offers programs that might take perhaps two semesters to complete. So those that are certificate programs are either a semester or two in length if youre a full time student. Um and then we have programs that are designed for you to go directly into the workforce. So if youre interested in perhaps um becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT, um if youre interested in, if you like working in the in health care, but not sure you wanna have direct patient care, you might think about something like clinical lab technician. Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license, once you complete your programs here at Dutchess, youre eligible to take the state licensing exams. And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh, the employment opportunities will basically, you know, hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse. If youre interested in transferring to a four year school, youre interested. I, I looked at the list people, a lot of people wanted to be doctors and physical therapists and nurses and, um, all those high level jobs. I mean, Dutchess is a great place to start. Even if youre thinking, um, you know, you know, for sure you wanna continue on. It really doesnt matter where you start, but it matters where you finish. So we are an excellent choice, especially during, um, online teaching. You know, when maybe you want to be the next Doctor Fauci, we have a public health program, um, that is articulated with Suny Albany, which means you can take the two years, uh, of courses, full time at Dutchess and all of your credits will transfer to University of Albany. So you can complete and get your bachelors degree in public health or you may choose to stay and get your masters in public health. Um, so there are a lot of opportunities we also have, um, what we call the Liberal Arts science pathway. So if you do wanna be that physical therapist, you wanna be that, um, dentist, you wanna be the doctor. You wanna be the occupational therapist. You can again, start at dutchess. Get two years of education, take all your sciences, your general education that you would normally take at a four year school as a freshman or a sophomore. And then those credits transfer, um, to your institutions. We have students who transfer all over the place. Um, they may, a lot of them go to Suny Binghamton. It has an excellent science reputation. Suny Stony Brook, Suny, New Paul University of Albany. And of course, Marist, uh Mount Saint Marys. Um, we have hi and the students who go through dutchess and transfer, they have a very high success rate. Once they transfer, our studies have shown that um our graduates typically uh do better at a four year institution than other transfer students as well as some of their original students that started there as a freshman. So right in your, in your neighborhood, you know, youve got Duchess and, and some of our tech jobs, you know, a semester, two years, four years, I mean, you can just keep building on as was already mentioned. And then before you know, it, um you can be out there doing what you hope to do while youre in high school. Im gonna tell you probably the same thing your mother has told you. Your father has told you, your guidance counselors have told you and your teachers have told you if you are interested in health care, you need to work hard at the sciences, your biology classes, if youre lucky enough and you, maybe youre doing a P biology, maybe with Miss Glancy or Missus mcfarland. I mean, youre gonna walk out and youre gonna do very well when you get to your, your, your institution of choice. Um, but, um, you know, continue with your chemistry, continue with your math. Um, you really want to make sure you have sharp skills because thats not gonna go away as you enter into, um, the courses at the college level. You also want to try to be mindful about your senior year. I know its senioritis kicks in but you want to m make sure that you are challenging yourself, pick courses. I mean, obviously any courses that you need to get your diploma, but if you have the opportunity to take those challenging courses, those A P courses, if thats a recommendation, we would highly recommend that you do that. You wanna show your, um, your college as you go through the admission process that, um, youre not afraid of hard course work. Um, they dont necessarily like to see a whole bunch of electives. Electives are great, right? Because how do you know what you wanna do? I know theres seventh graders, eighth graders, ninth graders, everyones here today. Very few people know for sure what they wanna do. Or even if they think they know what they wanna do, they might still end up changing their mind. And so by taking an elective, maybe a computer class or, or maybe a forensic science class, something outside of your normal, uh, course options. Who knows? That experience might, might help you really fine tune what you wanna study at your, at your institution. Um, and then if youre worried about your ranking, if youre taking an A P class, if you get a B plus in a college level biology class, OK. Put that in your essay. You know, I, I chose to challenge myself. Um I took college level calculus. I chose to challenge myself in my senior year or my junior year because I think its important to, you know, if Im capable, I should, I should try to do it and uh you know, get position yourself, you know, for that, for that uh transfer to the four year school. Um Anything else? Amy? I dont wanna, I, Im just looking at the time I wanna give opportunity for, for everyone to ask questions.\\n00:39:30 - spk_3:  Absolutely. We did have a few questions\\r\\n come in.\\n00:39:32 - spk_4:  Um\\r\\n Someone was asking about taking classes the best way  to take these classes\\r\\n while theyre in high school.\\n00:39:37 - spk_0: And I do think  you\\r\\n definitely wanna check with your counselor.\\n00:39:40 - spk_4:  You\\r\\n can look online and um see our course handbook.\\n00:39:44 - spk_0: I do understand what Miss Ingham was saying about electives. You wanna push yourself with your core content classes, but it is really great. Um particularly for the health sciences.  Our anatomy\\r\\n and physiology class is a great way to figure out if thats something that you, that you enjoy. Um I know over at Ketchum, Miss Gorman is teaching that class and, and shes on the call today. Um So you wanna, you wanna see these courses talking to your teachers too, specifically, your science teachers. Um They can make recommendations about specific um courses that they have  on here And I see Miss mcfarland\\r\\n is on here too.\\n00:40:18 - spk_4:  Um\\r\\n So Im trying to just wanna see if I have um any hospital.  Um So\\r\\n I think what we can do if um you wanna raise your, your hand, we can um come off Mike\\n00:40:35 - spk_0: and um but I wanna make sure we dont have everybody coming off Mike um at once. Um so we can try that and if it gets a little bit, I see them, we will um go to the chat box but I know sometimes its easier just to, to raise your hand and Ill look for your hand coming up on the screen and try to call on you for questions. Um So ami you have a question if you wanna come off.  Um I can actually unmute you if you wanna ask\\r\\n your question.\\n00:41:00 - spk_3:  Um Are\\r\\n there any like books that you read\\n00:41:03 - spk_2: that really like impact you and influence you to  go into the medical\\r\\n field?\\n00:41:08 - spk_3: Great question.\\n\\n\\n\"), HumanMessage(content=' \\nUser Query: Who was talking about electives?')]\n",

Um, kind of like its a puzzle and I tie that in with studying science where we always dont know the answer, but we do the research to try to get to that point.

This is Laney Belmonte. She is going to provide you with the employer perspective. Um As I said, shes the director of Human Resources. So thinking through what would a potential employer be looking for. So go ahead, Laney. Oh, she might be on mute. Think you might be on mute. Laney, I can meet you.\\n00:20:55 - spk_4: There you go.\\n00:20:56 - spk_3: Hows that?\\n00:20:57 - spk_5: Ok. So hello everyone. Im glad to see so many of you interested in health care. Um I work in human resources at Premier Medical Group. And uh one of the things we do in human resources is we hire people. Um So in that premiere, we have many different uh types of health care positions from those support positions that we were talking about um through to many of the technical positions. And one of the questions we might ask someone, you know, in an interview when theyre interviewing for a job is what led you to the career of being in health care. So I wanna talk to you about reasons you might think you want to be in health care. So one reason is you like working with people um or youre very compassionate and you, you like caring for people. Uh or you like science, youve enjoyed your science classes, you like uh the research involved, youre very analytical. Um you like to solve problems. Uh That might be another reason why job stability, there is a lot of job stability in health care. Um People are gonna continue to have Children and babies. Um Unfortunately, illnesses um are inevitable. Uh So theres, theres always gonna be a need for that personal care. Uh and health care workers, our population is growing. So um with, with the growing population, uh the demand for health care workers is increasing. So many health care positions are well paid um as the demand increases for healthcare workers typically. So do the, the, the salaries, health care careers are really diverse. You can, uh go into just general medicine. Uh, you can choose to go into a specialty. Uh, you know, here at premiere, we have many specialties, uh, you know, on the slide here it says foot, mouth, heart lungs. So a podiatrist is someone who specializes with feet. A cardiologist would specialize with, um, with issues of the heart. Uh Then theres also the administrative and management side. So we have medical billing people that are, they, theyre not clinical people who are doing hands on uh patient care, but theyre still in health care and they do uh billing or marketing or human resources. So theres, theres other admin of options in health care as well. So the the good news is theres lots of choices, there are many choices in the field of health care. Uh Some that require 1 to 2 years of advanced study after high school. Uh Some that might require uh four years of study or, or more and typically your, your income will increase the more education you have. So what can you guys do now to prepare for a career in health care? One is to finish high school, get your diploma. So thats, thats the first thing that you need to do. Um start doing some research, Google stuff. Look online, talk to your guidance counselors, talk to your parents, um perhaps talk to a healthcare professional whos doing the job, find out what their day to day is like, what they like, what they dislike. Um Those are all things that you can do to sort of explore this, this um this field of study and try to gain some experience. There might be some internships out there. Uh Oftentimes you can shadow a health care professional. Um Weve done that here. Ive had a couple of people come through here and uh just come in for a day and shadow someone to see what its like to work uh in a particular uh position. Um We also have hired people just for summer jobs, you know, so you get a flavor of, you know, what its like to even be in the healthcare environment. Uh Theres some volunteer opportunities. Uh Sometimes the nursing homes in the hospitals have volunteer hos uh opportunities. So, um so the good news is, its, its very diverse. Um Healthcare can be a really rewarding career. Um I have a couple of resources here that uh I just want you to take a quick look at because this, this could be part of your research. Um Louise, if you can, you click on that first link\\n00:25:54 - spk_4:  and Laney while were\\r\\n waiting for Louise to bring up that page.\\n00:25:57 - spk_0: A question came in from Rebecca asking if theres um  um uh a minimum\\r\\n age that you need to be in order to do shadowing.\\n00:26:07 - spk_5: So, uh we typically have uh I would say you know, 17, probably 17 and above.\\n00:26:18 - spk_3: Great, great.\\n00:26:21 - spk_5: Uh So this is uh US news and its best health care jobs. These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before. Uh th those that typically require more education. So you can see well just for, you know, demonstration purposes. Um You can see, uh Im sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen. Is there a way to maybe I can just click it off. Thank you.\\n00:26:48 - spk_3: I have it.  I\\r\\n got it.\\n00:26:57 - spk_5: So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes its a little\\n00:27:05 - spk_3: switch back and forth but were waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit? Um Some of our students arent familiar with that term.\\n00:43:17 - spk_4: OK.\\n00:43:19 - spk_0: And I think, um to, to your point, Gavin and others are probably thinking of it. Its just really just checking in with um your counselors to hear if theyve heard anything they can reach out. You can you, you know, I always tell people if you have a question, youre more than welcome to email me. I may not know the answer, but I will work hard to try to find it out, uh find it for you. Um But ii, I do think that um particularly because of, of the pandemic, the health care sciences are really limiting right now having um people come in but perhaps that theyre working um  to develop some, some remote\\r\\n opportunities.\\n00:43:55 - spk_5: I, I just wanna, Im sorry, I just wanna say one thing.

Um, I do\\r\\n know,\\n00:44:46 - spk_4:  I want to be sensitive\\r\\n to time and I do know we have one more poll question.\\n00:44:50 - spk_3: Um, I believe. Um, so I dont know if Doctor mclaughlin, if you wanna launch that, it, it speaking to, I know a few people have asked um what other professions were gonna be talking about? And um we are interested in that and we can go back through the chat to see if we have um captured those.  Do we have one more pool?\\r\\n Yes. OK, good.\\n00:45:11 - spk_4:  So, um these, these um are one of the, like\\r\\n I think it was the top 10\\n00:45:18 - spk_3: professions that came from the survey that we um collected data from you.

So I wanna talk to you about reasons you might think you want to be in health care. So one reason is you like working with people um or youre very compassionate and you, you like caring for people. Uh or you like science, youve enjoyed your science classes, you like uh the research involved, youre very analytical. Um you like to solve problems. Uh That might be another reason why job stability, there is a lot of job stability in health care. Um People are gonna continue to have Children and babies. Um Unfortunately, illnesses um are inevitable. Uh So theres, theres always gonna be a need for that personal care. Uh and health care workers, our population is growing. So um with, with the growing population, uh the demand for health care workers is increasing. So many health care positions are well paid um as the demand increases for healthcare workers typically. So do the, the, the salaries, health care careers are really diverse. You can, uh go into just general medicine. Uh, you can choose to go into a specialty. Uh, you know, here at premiere, we have many specialties, uh, you know, on the slide here it says foot, mouth, heart lungs. So a podiatrist is someone who specializes with feet. A cardiologist would specialize with, um, with issues of the heart. Uh Then theres also the administrative and management side. So we have medical billing people that are, they, theyre not clinical people who are doing hands on uh patient care, but theyre still in health care and they do uh billing or marketing or human resources. So theres, theres other admin of options in health care as well. So the the good news is theres lots of choices, there are many choices in the field of health care. Uh Some that require 1 to 2 years of advanced study after high school. Uh Some that might require uh four years of study or, or more and typically your, your income will increase the more education you have. So what can you guys do now to prepare for a career in health care? One is to finish high school, get your diploma. So thats, thats the first thing that you need to do. Um start doing some research, Google stuff. Look online, talk to your guidance counselors, talk to your parents, um perhaps talk to a healthcare professional whos doing the job, find out what their day to day is like, what they like, what they dislike. Um Those are all things that you can do to sort of explore this, this um this field of study and try to gain some experience. There might be some internships out there. Uh Oftentimes you can shadow a health care professional. Um Weve done that here. Ive had a couple of people come through here and uh just come in for a day and shadow someone to see what its like to work uh in a particular uh position. Um We also have hired people just for summer jobs, you know, so you get a flavor of, you know, what its like to even be in the healthcare environment. Uh Theres some volunteer opportunities. Uh Sometimes the nursing homes in the hospitals have volunteer hos uh opportunities. So, um so the good news is, its, its very diverse. Um Healthcare can be a really rewarding career. Um I have a couple of resources here that uh I just want you to take a quick look at because this, this could be part of your research. Um Louise, if you can, you click on that first link\\n00:25:54 - spk_4:  and Laney while were\\r\\n waiting for Louise to bring up that page.\\n00:25:57 - spk_0: A question came in from Rebecca asking if theres um  um uh a minimum\\r\\n age that you need to be in order to do shadowing.\\n00:26:07 - spk_5: So, uh we typically have uh I would say you know, 17, probably 17 and above.\\n00:26:18 - spk_3: Great, great.\\n00:26:21 - spk_5: Uh So this is uh US news and its best health care jobs. These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before. Uh th those that typically require more education. So you can see well just for, you know, demonstration purposes. Um You can see, uh Im sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen. Is there a way to maybe I can just click it off. Thank you.\\n00:26:48 - spk_3: I have it.  I\\r\\n got it.\\n00:26:57 - spk_5: So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes its a little\\n00:27:05 - spk_3: switch back and forth but were waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit? Um Some of our students arent familiar with that term.\\n00:43:17 - spk_4: OK.\\n00:43:19 - spk_0: And I think, um to, to your point, Gavin and others are probably thinking of it. Its just really just checking in with um your counselors to hear if theyve heard anything they can reach out. You can you, you know, I always tell people if you have a question, youre more than welcome to email me. I may not know the answer, but I will work hard to try to find it out, uh find it for you. Um But ii, I do think that um particularly because of, of the pandemic, the health care sciences are really limiting right now having um people come in but perhaps that theyre working um  to develop some, some remote\\r\\n opportunities.\\n00:43:55 - spk_5: I, I just wanna, Im sorry, I just wanna say one thing. Um So what weve done, we do have a couple of college students that are doing temperature taking because because of the pandemic, weve had to station people in front of uh all of our different offices. So um that is one thing to potentially uh you know, look, look into, they might have temperature takers that sit in the front.\\n00:44:23 - spk_3: Right. Great. Good point.  Yeah, I think that some of these uh newer\\r\\n needs are developing as this\\n00:44:29 - spk_4: is new. So,  um, it\\r\\n certainly, uh, is something to keep checking in on. Um, and, and obviously\\n00:44:35 - spk_3: theres certain things that you can do at certain ages. So, um, you, as you get, um, closer to graduation or post graduation, more opportunities will open up for you.  Um, I do\\r\\n know,\\n00:44:46 - spk_4:  I want to be sensitive\\r\\n to time and I do know we have one more poll question.\\n00:44:50 - spk_3: Um, I believe. Um, so I dont know if Doctor mclaughlin, if you wanna launch that, it, it speaking to, I know a few people have asked um what other professions were gonna be talking about? And um we are interested in that and we can go back through the chat to see if we have um captured those.  Do we have one more pool?\\r\\n Yes. OK, good.\\n00:45:11 - spk_4:  So, um these, these um are one of the, like\\r\\n I think it was the top 10\\n00:45:18 - spk_3: professions that came from the survey that we um collected data from you.  And were just\\r\\n trying to get a sense on\\n00:45:25 - spk_4:  um working with the\\r\\n professionals that we have access to um who we might\\n\\n\\n\"), HumanMessage(content=' \\nUser Query: The minimum age to do what is 17?')], 'history': 'System: The human provides a context of a meeting related to healthcare careers, discussing employment opportunities, job clusters, required skills, and job locations within the healthcare industry.
