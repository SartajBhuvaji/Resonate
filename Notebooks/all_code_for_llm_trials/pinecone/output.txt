Conversations in meeting 'Healthcare Meeting 1':
00:00:00 - spk_0: I am one of the directors in Wappingers Central School District. I love seeing so many cameras on. So as Im talking, I see um its, its like lights flickering and more faces are appearing and um so excited to have so many of our Wappingers Central School District students joining us today. So I am gonna be hopping back and forth between our screens, but I did want to um just share a little bit about what this presentation is. Were going to go ahead and we are going to record this session. So, um Im going to go ahead and ask Louise as Im talking to get that started, that will allow any of our students who werent able to log in or if you wanna go back at a later date, just to review some of the information our speaker shared. I will be posting this information on our website. We also are gonna be um this will be live streamed on our youtube website. So thats another place that you can go to view this, this information. So again, this is called Our Career Zoom Health Series and this is session one of of, well, lets see, I think we have all the way through June scheduled. So we um are looking forward to doing that. So I dont have access to go to the next slide. But if Louise you want to go to the next slide for me, I will um just explain this partnership that developed organically. So we have two systems from the education realm. So obviously myself from Wapping Central school district is here and also Dutchess Community College will is on the call and worked collaboratively to bring this together. And in addition, we have the workforce Investment board and the Workforce Development Institute from New York State that the four of us work together. And we will be bringing into as youll see today, local and regional employers to bring some insights to you about the health care field. So Ill introduce everyone to you if we go to the next slide. So again, myself, Amy Watkins and then um Mary Jane Bertram, if you want to wave on the screen, everyone can see who you are. She is coming to us as the regional director from the Workforce Development Institute through New York State. Lorraine Koutz is from workforce development uh liaison and shes coming to us from the Duchess Community College. So, hello, Lorraine and obviously um the mastermind that brought and invited us to take part in this is Doctor Louise mclaughlin. And um she is the executive Director for Duchess County Workforce Investment Board So we were really thrilled to have these ladies with us working on this together and then our speakers for today, uh Doctor mclaughlin is gonna be talking to you first about an overview of the employment opportunities in our region. So thats always important to know what is out there um Before you pursue and put a lot of money into a career. If there are no jobs coming in that area, we also have Lane Belmonte coming to us to provide the employer perspective and she is the director of Human Resources from Premier Medical Group. So, hello, Laney and Karen Ingham is uh gonna be talking about education planning. So she has many, many hats that she wears at Dutchess Community College. Shes the department chair and assistant professor. She um is it leads the Department of Allied Health and Biological Sciences and also program chair, clinical laboratory technician and phlebotomy. So that is a mouthful. So thank you for joining us, Karen. So just a little bit of how, how we got here through this zoom. Um What the purpose of this is and I I sort of touched on this, but this is an opportunity for you our students to ask questions, to learn more about the health care profession, to see if it is a good fit for you before you do invest money um into an expensive college uh decision. And from here, I just wanted to go over this the next slide and just to give you a background that I um worked with three of our science teachers in the district to help put together, we developed a survey. We had over 310 of our students respond, which is really exciting. Um And they gave us some questions that they would like answered from the health care profession. And weve designed these series to give you information, but also allow you time like the last 15 minutes. Um And maybe a little bit longer if you have more questions for you to ask some questions at the end for our speakers. So just a little bit of housekeeping information are actually 1 to 2 and um each month. So we have these scheduled each month, theyre gonna be the third Wednesday, as I mentioned. Um And theyre gonna begin from 1230 to 115. We chose Wednesday because those are our virtual days and your instruction has has let out. So um we wanted to, to make this accessible as possible. And as many of you have already started to do your um the housekeeping pieces on the next screen are going to be um everyone is on mute as you can tell unless youre the speaker and that just cuts down on the extra background noise. So that is why everyone will be on mute. Um We want your camera to be on, this is your chance to make a connection with professionals. So you do wanna be um showing us your face and, and letting us know and getting used to that. This is uh right now, this is how we are connecting with, with professionals in our area because its the safest way to, to do that. Um When we cant be in person, you will have access to and I will be monitoring the chat once we get going. Um So you can ask questions and we will um be starting with our first poll because we wanna know a little bit more about who is on this call today. How many from, um, you know what grade youre in? Maybe youre a parent. So youll see pop up on your screen. Its gonna ask you what grade youre in or if youre a guidance counselor or a teacher, um, just go ahead and you can see live as the results start to pop in. So were pretty excited to see this. Weve got, um, almost, we have 66% of everybody voted. Um, and it does seem like, um, which makes sense that the, the, the, the highest number is coming from our 11th and 12th graders. Um, if at any point during this, um, you do have questions or afterwards you get a question and youre, youre wondering about, please dont hesitate. You see my emails come in. If you havent seen my emails, theyre probably in your junk folder. So definitely look for my name and, and try to find them, but without further ado, we looks like we have a great group of individuals here today, um uh that have joined us the majority being 11th and 12th graders, which is absolutely perfect. So were gonna kick it off. I am going to turn it over to Doctor mclaughlin and shes gonna give you an overview of what those employment opportunities look like in our region. So, thank you, Doctor mclaughlin.
00:07:19 - spk_1: Sorry, I put my face off screen and then I couldnt find the mute button. Um All right. So Im gonna just give you a little overview of sort of like what the numbers are in terms of employment um in general, in our five county regions. So not just Dutchess County, but the counties that touch our borders which are Ulster County, Orange, Putnam. And then um we dont really want to forget Westchester County because its just below Putnam South of us and theres a lot of job opportunities there. Um Were seeing um consistent job growth in health care over the past um five years. And if you look at the top industries in the region, they, the number one industry is health care uh along with social assistance and then government and retail, um the largest um healthcare employer shouldnt surprise you is the hospitals, but theres a lot of other employers throughout the county. So were gonna look at two kind of clusters. We, we kind of look at occupations, we can look at them individually, but we can also look them in groups and we call them like clusters. So theres 15 health care support occupations that I pulled some data for and theyre listed on the side. They started with home health aids, personal care aides and so on. And when youre looking to see, you know about um like what job opportunities are there, you kind of look to the job postings. So um this job supply right now is at about 48,000 650. And compensation here is um about 30 1000 a year, almost 32,000. And a lot of these are your entry level jobs. Um You know, where you might want to start in, in health care. And then if you look down, I also included the um the average wage nationally just so  that you would have that as sort
 of a point to, to look at. And then this data came from um Bureau of Labor Statistics and from um uh this organization called MC. Then when we look at um the skills that you need, the, we talk about hard skills and soft skills. So the hard skills are what you get from like a training provider from a school and you might end up with a certificate, um you know, with, with some of these. So their, their certificates in, you know, like home care. So when theres job postings, they all they list in the posting sort of what theyre looking for. So these are the things that these top jobs and the frequency that theyre looking for. So theyre looking for home care, caregiving people that can do meal planning and preparation of nutrition, stuff, personal care, um nursing, CPR  uh medical assistance,
 um daily activities, life activities, rehabilitation, and phlebotomy. And then we look at um next we go to, we look at soft skills.  So
 before I do  this, I want to
 ask you a question. So Im gonna launch a pulp and this question is for students only. So please select the answer that that best fits you. So I am currently working. Dont click that until you read a little bit more. Um Ive had a job in the past. Ive had participated in an internship and then theres some combination. So I currently have a job and Ive done an internship, Ive had a job in the past and Ive done an internship, Ive not had a job, but Im interested in working. Ive not had an internship, internship, but Im interested in internship and Ive not had a job or  internship but am interested in both or
 none of the above.
00:10:39 - spk_2: If youre not sure what this is about,
00:10:41 - spk_1:  thats OK too because well explain more as we go
 through the series, Ill give it another 20 seconds or so. OK. Five more seconds. OK. OK. So just sharing the results. So people can kind of see where everybodys at. OK. All right. So the reason I asked the question is if you look at the, the top common skills, OK, there are skills like communication, um compassion, customer service is a big one. Scheduling, clerical work, management, cleanliness, computer literacy, detail oriented. These are all skills that you can acquire in an internship or in really almost any part time job because these are the, the just the general skills that you need just to be able to work, go to work, be part of a team. Um, you know, report well with a supervisor, work well with management and so on. And then youll notice too that theres a valid drivers license. A lot of these, you know, they like you to drive. So if you, you know, if youre inclined to drive and you can have an opportunity to learn, um, it would be good to get a license if you can. Um, so where, where are these folks working? Where are the people in these healthcare support occupations, working within the industry? So if you go to um, a hospital youll see 12% of the workers there are, are in the healthcare support occupations, in a nursing care facility. Its more like 40%. Home health care services is the same around 37%. And then in offices of physicians its 18%. And in dentist its 33% and someone raised their hands. Mm.  Do you wanna unmute
 and do you have
00:26:18 - spk_3: Great, great.
00:26:21 - spk_5: Uh So this is uh US news and its best health care jobs. These are more of those technical jobs that we were looking at before. Uh th those that typically require more education. So you can see well just for, you know, demonstration purposes. Um You can see, uh Im sorry, Louise, the poll is still showing up on my screen. Is there a way to maybe I can just click it off. Thank you.
00:26:48 - spk_3: I have it.  I
 got it.
00:26:57 - spk_5: So I think Louise is still putting up the, um, the link. I know sometimes its a little
00:27:05 - spk_3: switch back and forth but were waiting for her to do that. Can you describe shadowing a little bit? Um Some of our students arent familiar with that term.
00:31:10 - spk_3:  Well, if the,
 if the school has any connections uh with different um health care
00:31:18 - spk_5: uh facilities, that might be the best way then they can advocate for those students. Um If in the absence of those, the student can uh try to contact someone at the organization. Um but it is probably better to have um  an
 advocate,
00:31:37 - spk_3: right? And I think like, um I can speak from the the school perspective, work based learning would be the a great way to do that. So for our district right now, Mrs Noy is in charge of the work based learning program. So if thats something um you can work with your guidance counselor to make sure you have work based learning on uh your schedule and then get in contact with Mrs Noy and, and she can uh work with you on different ways uh to reach out to the different agencies. And I know another student had asked about an internship with a um with a dietitian or nutritionist. And I would say that that would work the same way from our perspective, working at the schools. Although they probably could reach out to um a specific person that is in that field. Is that good for a second question that I it was kind of both of them. They were very Oh yeah. So is that, is that it for you, Miss Brown?  That is it
 for me? Unless anyone has any questions, Im happy to um answer them. Ok. And what we might do is well let um M Ingham go ahead and then we can have questions across the board for everyone because I wanna make that we do have time for, um, Miss Karen Ingham to speak from Dutchess Community College. So Im gonna turn it over to her and just keep putting your questions in the chat. Ill try to get to them, um, and, and bring them on to the end if we, if we have time. Go ahead, Karen.  All right. Well,
 thank you everybody. Its a pleasure to be here this afternoon.
00:33:08 - spk_6: Um Im here to talk a little bit about um what you might wanna think about doing when youre still in high school to prepare you for entry at the college level and uh not just community college. I mean, were an excellent choice. Um We have a low tuition and we do offer a variety of allied health programs you can see on the screen, the college offers offers programs that might take perhaps two semesters to complete. So those that are certificate programs are either a semester or two in length if youre a full time student. Um and then we have programs that are designed for you to go directly into the workforce. So if youre interested in perhaps um becoming a paramedic or working as an EMT, um if youre interested in, if you like working in the in health care, but not sure you wanna have direct patient care, you might think about something like clinical lab technician. Um Our programs are registered through the state And if you do need to have a license, once you complete your programs here at Dutchess, youre eligible to take the state licensing exams. And that typically will open a lot of doors and, uh, the employment opportunities will basically, you know, hopefully continue to fall in our graduates lapse. If youre interested in transferring to a four year school, youre interested. I, I looked at the list people, a lot of people wanted to be doctors and physical therapists and nurses and, um, all those high level jobs. I mean, Dutchess is a great place to start. Even if youre thinking, um, you know, you know, for sure you wanna continue on. It really doesnt matter where you start, but it matters where you finish. So we are an excellent choice, especially during, um, online teaching. You know, when maybe you want to be the next Doctor Fauci, we have a public health program, um, that is articulated with Suny Albany, which means you can take the two years, uh, of courses, full time at Dutchess and all of your credits will transfer to University of Albany. So you can complete and get your bachelors degree in public health or you may choose to stay and get your masters in public health. Um, so there are a lot of opportunities we also have, um, what we call the Liberal Arts science pathway. So if you do wanna be that physical therapist, you wanna be that, um, dentist, you wanna be the doctor. You wanna be the occupational therapist. You can again, start at dutchess. Get two years of education, take all your sciences, your general education that you would normally take at a four year school as a freshman or a sophomore. And then those credits transfer, um, to your institutions. We have students who transfer all over the place. Um, they may, a lot of them go to Suny Binghamton. It has an excellent science reputation. Suny Stony Brook, Suny, New Paul University of Albany. And of course, Marist, uh Mount Saint Marys. Um, we have hi and the students who go through dutchess and transfer, they have a very high success rate. Once they transfer, our studies have shown that um our graduates typically uh do better at a four year institution than other transfer students as well as some of their original students that started there as a freshman. So right in your, in your neighborhood, you know, youve got Duchess and, and some of our tech jobs, you know, a semester, two years, four years, I mean, you can just keep building on as was already mentioned. And then before you know, it, um you can be out there doing what you hope to do while youre in high school. Im gonna tell you probably the same thing your mother has told you. Your father has told you, your guidance counselors have told you and your teachers have told you if you are interested in health care, you need to work hard at the sciences, your biology classes, if youre lucky enough and you, maybe youre doing a P biology, maybe with Miss Glancy or Missus mcfarland. I mean, youre gonna walk out and youre gonna do very well when you get to your, your, your institution of choice. Um, but, um, you know, continue with your chemistry, continue with your math. Um, you really want to make sure you have sharp skills because thats not gonna go away as you enter into, um, the courses at the college level. You also want to try to be mindful about your senior year. I know its senioritis kicks in but you want to m make sure that you are challenging yourself, pick courses. I mean, obviously any courses that you need to get your diploma, but if you have the opportunity to take those challenging courses, those A P courses, if thats a recommendation, we would highly recommend that you do that. You wanna show your, um, your college as you go through the admission process that, um, youre not afraid of hard course work. Um, they dont necessarily like to see a whole bunch of electives. Electives are great, right? Because how do you know what you wanna do? I know theres seventh graders, eighth graders, ninth graders, everyones here today. Very few people know for sure what they wanna do. Or even if they think they know what they wanna do, they might still end up changing their mind. And so by taking an elective, maybe a computer class or, or maybe a forensic science class, something outside of your normal, uh, course options. Who knows? That experience might, might help you really fine tune what you wanna study at your, at your institution. Um, and then if youre worried about your ranking, if youre taking an A P class, if you get a B plus in a college level biology class, OK. Put that in your essay. You know, I, I chose to challenge myself. Um I took college level calculus. I chose to challenge myself in my senior year or my junior year because I think its important to, you know, if Im capable, I should, I should try to do it and uh you know, get position yourself, you know, for that, for that uh transfer to the four year school. Um Anything else? Amy? I dont wanna, I, Im just looking at the time I wanna give opportunity for, for everyone to ask questions.
00:39:30 - spk_3:  Absolutely. We did have a few questions
 come in.
00:43:17 - spk_4: OK.
00:43:19 - spk_0: And I think, um to, to your point, Gavin and others are probably thinking of it. Its just really just checking in with um your counselors to hear if theyve heard anything they can reach out. You can you, you know, I always tell people if you have a question, youre more than welcome to email me. I may not know the answer, but I will work hard to try to find it out, uh find it for you. Um But ii, I do think that um particularly because of, of the pandemic, the health care sciences are really limiting right now having um people come in but perhaps that theyre working um  to develop some, some remote
 opportunities.
00:43:55 - spk_5: I, I just wanna, Im sorry, I just wanna say one thing. Um So what weve done, we do have a couple of college students that are doing temperature taking because because of the pandemic, weve had to station people in front of uh all of our different offices. So um that is one thing to potentially uh you know, look, look into, they might have temperature takers that sit in the front.
00:44:23 - spk_3: Right. Great. Good point.  Yeah, I think that some of these uh newer
 needs are developing as this
00:44:29 - spk_4: is new. So,  um, it
 certainly, uh, is something to keep checking in on. Um, and, and obviously
00:48:02 - spk_4: Um at I think it was the eight
00:48:06 - spk_0: 18th. Let me look quick on my calendar. So make sure I get the third Wednesday of December and it is December 16th. So we will be back on December 16th. I will continue to send you emails again if you did not get my email today, make sure you look in your um spam or your trash or your junk folder to see if um uh it might be there. But um that is where I will be um sending the emails. I also do put these links in the calendar. So on any of our web pages, if you click on your calendar, building events, calendar, youll see the the month calendar. And um these will be on there called Career Zoom Healthcare Series. So, um again, dont hesitate to email any questions. Thank you for all the thank yous that are coming up through the chat. Um And we really look forward to um hosting more of these for you. Have a great.


Conversations in meeting 'Healthcare Meeting 2':
00:05:29 - spk_1: So that, thats actually, that was the very beginning of it all. Um, so I mean, first, Im, Im a, Im a physician. Im a psychiatrist and I specialize in child ana in psychiatry. I think, um, you know, people always ask, you know, when did you first realize you wanted to be a child psychiatrist or a psychiatrist in general? And, um, I guess the answer for me was really in eighth grade when a teacher of mine, this is like my very first mentor. So thatll be, thatll be kind of my, my biggest piece of advice is to frankly grab a, a mentor and somebody whos really invested in you and in your career. So my, my English teacher whos also my homeroom teacher, she gave me a book on Freuds interpretation of dreams. And she said, you know, I really think youd be a great psychiatrist. It, you know, I hadnt spent even a moment kind of considering what my career path would be when I was in eighth grade. I was, you know, focused on my friends and trying to get by in school and I wasnt especially a good student. I was a decent student. But, um that was really kind of a shock. My, my best friends father as it turns out was a psychiatrist and also kind of odd. And I thought, wow, does that mean that Im odd? And is that like, but, but, you know, it turns out you can be a psychiatrist and not be odd. Um I dont think I was odd in the end. But it really planted a very important seed and it then revisited itself when I applied to college. And I was asked again, what would my major be? You know? And I thought, hm, I guess if I wanna be a psychiatrist, I should probably major in preme or do premedical classes. So thats how I set out at the beginning of my college career. I went to the University of Wisconsin. And um I really had absolutely no concept of what was required in terms of effort to be successful on a pre med path. And so very soon into my college career, I realized, gosh, I cant have fun in college and, and enjoy myself and take other kinds of classes and also, you know, survive premed. So I switched tracks and II, I became a psychology major instead. And then I thought to myself, wow. And I was gonna the next kind of point or I had to figure things out. I was, I was practically a junior or senior in college. And, and um I had to think about whats my next steps. I thought while I was a psychology major, I might as well pursue a graduate degree in psychology to be, to be a clinical psychologist because I had already skipped over all these premed classes that are required for medical school. And I was sitting in interviews for first clinical psychology. And I was asked the question, why do you want to be a clinical psychologist. And it occurred to me in that moment, um, I, I really didnt want to be a clinical psychologist. I wanted to be a psychiatrist and a physician and I, you know, and I, and I tell these stories and these are actually very true stories because I had no idea what I was doing when I was in seventh grade or eighth grader, ninth grade or 10th grader. Even when I was a senior in college, I had very little idea of what I was doing. I had a sense of what my interests were. I had a sense of what I thought Id be good at more importantly. And it just kind of gave this little um beacon of, of direction, but it wasnt as um kind of thought out. I had an experience when I was a, I think a freshman in college is a camp counselor where I was a counselor in um, a bump for kids with autism. And that really fascinated me and I planted another seed and I thought to myself, oh, wow. So psychology psychiatry, maybe developmental disabilities. And that kind of led me to this direction of working with Children in psychiatry and developmental disabilities. And then, and then you kind of get on a path and, and you decide, well, if this is what Im gonna do, heres what it looks like. So it looks like you gotta finish college, you gotta go to medical school, then you gotta go to residency. And if you wanna work with kids, you have to do a fellowship on top of your residency. So I did um four years of college and then, because I wasnt premed, I, I did so terribly in my premed classes, I had to go back for uh two years to collect all the premed requirements, like chemistry and biology and physics. So thats basically six years of college. Plus whats, whats called post back then. Four years of medical school. So, what is that? Thats 10, then three years of adult psychiatry residency and two years of, of child psychiatry fellowship. So, my training was, was 15 years and I guess, you know, from, from the perspective of the seventh or 12th grader that, that feels like a very, very, very long time. Um, but, but frankly, its not because when you think about it, you know, you, you practice or you work for, I dont know, I just, I just turned 50 last week. What is that? I, I guess I, I finished when I was 30 all my schooling. So Ive already been practicing for 20 years and, you know, I only 50 you know, presumably I have another 25 years perhaps to go. So 15 years wouldnt be invested in like a career thats gonna be 4550 years. Its probably worth it. Um, I like to encourage people to go into medicine because I think that theres very, very few careers out there where you can have an impact on somebody every single day. You can actually feel like, wow, your work is meaningful. Youre helping people. Thats very gratifying. I think its, um, you know, when you invest so much time and energy and, and frankly money into a path, it, um, it feels like the investment really pays off. I, I think that psychiatry in particular is fascinating. I think its a really kind of developing field. I think people who are interested in how the mind works. Um It never gets boring. Theres always really fascinating stories. Theres always really amazing experiences working with families, theres always new things to learn, so youre constantly being challenged. Um So III I think, you know, in that sense, I would encourage people to consider medicine. Ill say one more thing and Im, Im happy to take some questions. So people I think are afraid of medicine because they feel like Im not good at math or Im not good at science. And, you know, I, I think it may be that math and science arent like your strengths necessarily. But I think if you work really hard, you can, you can overcome those things. I, I got a five credit DD in chemistry in college, you know, and, and I, I actually, I advertised that because that failure taught me an enormous amount about how to succeed and what it took. And so I then went back and I took another chemistry class and I got an a, um, because I learned, you know, what, what, what, whats required and it wasnt because I was good at chemistry. I was actually pretty bad at chemistry but you, you kind of figure it out over time. Um, I was a terrible math student. Um, in high school. I was like in that, at that point in eighth grade I was focused on like trying to pass math. Um and I got an a in calculus, you know, at Columbia eventually. So, you know what you decide right now in terms of what your strengths are and how you kind of view things may not necessarily be how you see things in five years or 10 years. So dont, dont um dont kind of predetermine your future based on very small experiences and find mentors, find people that are gonna like, inspire you and teach you and look out for you thats really important.
00:33:45 - spk_0: other questions. Um Ill open up to our panel too as I uh kind of go through some of our previous questions. Um If anyone wants to come off, I can ask a question. I did, I would like to ask um Doctor Alex about the research youre doing as psychiatrist.  Can. Can you share
 a little? Yeah, of course.
00:34:15 - spk_1: So when I started practicing as a psychiatrist, I found myself frustrated at our inability to really predict who might respond to certain kinds of treatments, right? We have lots of treatments for anxiety and depression and various other symptoms, but we dont do a very good job of being able to predict who might respond to a certain treatment over another treatment. And so I got interested in the idea of predicting treatment response and, and using things like genetics or biomarkers, you know, kind of biological markers in the blood or using um techniques that measure electrical activity in the brain, like using EEG and I thought, wow, you know, its wonderful to be able to treat patients and affect families on kind of a case by case basis. But when you do research, you can theoretically kind of move the whole field forward and you can, you can kind of, you know, drive major change. And so I got interested in clinical trials where we use things like genetics and we select populations of patients based on underlying genetic changes, whether its a specific genetic mutation in the gene that causes autism. Um And we try to understand the changes in the brain on the basis of what we know about the genetic changes. And then we think about ways to compensate for those changes in the brain using specific medicines. And then we study them in the context of a clinical trial. We will, we will take patients with a specific genetic mutation and we will enroll them either in a placebo group or a medication group and then we will follow them over time and we will look at improvement in, in, in clinical outcomes. Um And the, the goal is to develop new treatments. Mostly my, my research is mostly focused on autism. So the goal is to develop new treatments in autism,
00:36:05 - spk_0: I am one of the directors in Wappingers Central School District. between the work that Angela does even though um maybe the study on o opioids isnt the same but that it has to come from the animal point to come to you because your trials are on humans where her trials, you, you take the studies that develop through the research that comes from those animal trials. Um I dont know if either one of you wanna expand on that, how they feed into one another,  the importance of
 both.
00:36:37 - spk_2: Um Yeah, of course. Um Ultimately, I feel like everything that we do in research is to improve some kind of human experience. Um And so I study drug addiction and although Im interested in sort of like neuro immunomodulation, um Im well versed in a lot of different aspects of it. Um And so I do read human clinical trials sort of to see, get more background, get more information, but just, um I mean, Im not the most well versed in clinical trials, but I do know that a lot of things, a lot of drug trials, it has to start in an animal model first because you cant just recruit people off the street and said, hey, I have this new pill, Id love to see how it works. Would you like to try it? Um Its, thats very unethical. So the ethical route is to start in an animal model. And so if I can see, for instance, um my research is based on the fact that um a lot of chronic opioid users, whether its addiction or if its like a chronic opioid treatment with your doctor or something for chronic pain, there is some kind of degree of suppression of immune system activity. So that means that you are more susceptible to infection or illness than a healthy individual. And so, with my animal model, Im looking to see what is the degree of this suppression for chronic opioid abuse. And does this recover after a certain period of abstinence? And this, of course, Im sure you can imagine has a ton of implications, but if I can identify what exactly is being suppressed, how it is being suppressed. Um and maybe speculate on what this could mean, this could be used potentially in um rehabilitation facilities or sort of trials that are looking to help um drug addicts recover. Um Maybe one day very, very far in the future, we can cure addiction and it will take a lot of, you know, collaboration from a lot of different groups. But so my research, although it is in animals, the findings could have very significant implications for human trials. And so were not completely, Im not completely removed from human trials, although I probably wont ever my my specific research, I would not bring that to human clinical trials because thats like very, very far away. But I would pass it on to someone like Doctor Alex if he was researching something that I was, and its something that we could collaborate about and I can tell him hinge findings and then someone who is more well versed with humans can see how do we adapt that to a human trial?
00:39:14 - spk_0: Mhm. Are there any other questions or anything that anyone would like to add? Very quiet today and try Doctor Alex? Are there any skills that, um, you could share with our students that you feel um, would be beneficial for them? So soft, the soft skills that, um, you can learn in a textbook or in a college classroom? But if its something that they could work on and then also, I always want to ask if theres internship opportunities or shadowing opportunities for our students, if they wanted to learn more about this field.
00:41:31 - spk_0: Even high school, they dont have to be in college.  Yeah,
 they dont have to be in college. They had to be over 16.
00:41:37 - spk_1: Um Theres obviously a pretty significant limitations in terms of what they can do, but theres still learning opportunities that are meaningful right now. Its very challenging because theres limitations being placed based on COVID. So were only allowed to have a certain number of people on site. And I, I would say its also too late frankly, but I think for people that are interested, you know, get in touch with potential mentors in, you know, November, December, February. Do it, do it early act early blanket the universe. Use any connection you possibly have. Its very challenging to find mentors that are willing to host students but dont, dont give up. And every time somebody says no to you say I appreciate you writing back to me. Do you have anybody else who might suggest just keep, keep, keep pummeling away at it? Its very, very unfortunate how, how challenging it is but, you know, just keep, keep at it.
00:42:26 - spk_0: Excellent, excellent advice. And, um, Lorraine just before we, we let everyone go back to their, their work days because we do know now how busy they are. Um, did you want to share a little bit, um, about the, the Dutchess community connection with the Science Lax program?
00:42:43 - spk_4: Sure. Um Well, you know, and Im also this time around because of the other track, going to mention our human services um psychology track program for associates. So if youre not exactly sure where you wanna go, our liberal arts and science program would be the, the pre med track. But we also do have psychology and if youre really on sure, we have liberal arts and you can experience all of these different classes and take some sciences and, and take some psychology and, and see where you go because as we, as weve heard from our speakers today and speakers in the past, sometimes we, we pivot and we change and I love doctor Alex that you said, dont predetermine your future on very small experiences. We often talk ourselves out of a lot that were capable of. And I really like that. Both of you emphasized uh just working for it, just keep going and keep trying and, and, and putting your effort in and when you do figure it out, you will succeed.
00:43:57 - spk_0: Ill ask to answer any questions before we let everyone get back to their busy days.
00:00:00 - spk_0: And set to and now we are live. You will also be on our website. So. Ok. All right. So I think um well continue to monitor um the waiting room so that if anyone is um waiting to get in, you can see us. So lets take a moment just to welcome you. Um We are really excited about todays um presentation. We have two fabulous speakers with us today that I will introduce in a moment. Um We will be focusing on uh clinical trials somewhat but also um background in psychiatry and also neuroscience. Um So just to interview uh introduce everyone that is here with us and those that helped put this together. Of course, um It wouldnt be, uh we wouldnt be here without Doctor Louise mclaughlin who is um running the powerpoint presentation for us. Shes the executive director of Dutchess County Workforce Investment Board. So thank you for putting this together for as today. We also have Mary Jane Bertram who is here as Regional Director of the Hudson Valley Workforce Development Institute and Lorraine is here for as a workforce development liaison with Dutchess Community College. So our two speakers today are Doctor Alex Bulletin who is here and um Angela Dow, I hopefully Im saying that correctly. And um we will get just reminding you the purpose of the zoom today is really to give you an opportunity to learn more about these particular fields in the health sciences. All of this information, the video and the presentation will be posted as all the others are on our website during out during the zoom. As Ive encouraged you already, please make sure that you have your video on. Just make sure that you dont see a red slash through there. And that will allow us to get to know you just like if we have the opportunity to be in person in addition to that, um just uh be sure that you are listening so that you have some great questions to share with us. So um each of our speakers wanted the opportunity um to share a little bit about the life of what they do, how they got into the profession um that theyre in. Um And if theres anything that they would change or any advice that they could give you along the way. So as you, um we always do in our presentations, we share with you um some national averages and regional averages. Um This one is a very broad average for scientists and clinical researchers with the national average uh for the salary. The big piece on this slide is to note the growth in this area um of 11%. So thats always good to know and Im sure both of our speakers will be talking about the schooling um that is required. Um In addition to that, we also will be hearing from our research assistant um who is a recent uh well, a graduate from Roy Ketchum, but shell be talking about the, the extensive journey that shes been taking because its a number of years of experience to get where she is right now. Um In addition, we always talk about those um skills that each of the, the health sciences look for. So you can take a look through this once the presentation is posted and um our speakers can definitely uh listen, you can listen for this as our speakers talk to you regarding the skills that they, they feel are most important, um particularly those listening skills and then we will start by introducing it. So I make sure were on the same page. Um Doctor Alex Collison. So again, if, if I went too quickly over these present uh slides, you know that they will all be on the website. So Im pretty excited today to introduce to you, Doctor Alex Pool. And um he has a very long title. Um He is a child and adolescent psychiatrist and um works out of Mount Sinai in New York City through the icann um Center Fever Autism Institute. I think I messed the order of that up. So I apologize because I wasnt reading it. I was doing it from memory. Um, but, uh, Doctor Alex, who I finally called, Doctor Alex, um, uh, but Doctor Phil is gonna share with you, how did he get into this field? And, um, just some of the fabulous, very interesting things that he gets to do in his role. Im gonna turn it over to you, Doctor Alex and thank you again for being here.
00:04:29 - spk_1: Thanks, Amy. Its really good to be here. Maybe orient me a little bit. Who am I speaking to? Exactly. I see some faces. I see a lot of grown up faces but who else is like, generally speaking on the call? Youre muted, youre muted. Maybe you, youre muted.
00:04:52 - spk_0: Sorry, I was, I thought I clicked it and then I didnt. Um, so these are our students ranging from seventh grade through 12th grade. So, um, and, and also our, we have our adults that are here from, from putting these together and Angela who is also a speaker. So,  um, and several students might be popping
 on as
00:05:11 - spk_1: well. Seventh grade to 12th grade. Ok. Yes. And so youre, youre interested in sort of my trajectory? What got me started some advice. Yeah. Ok.  Um, so
 I,
00:05:23 - spk_0: Ill definitely share your story that you shared with me already about what your teacher had told  you. Oh,
 yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
