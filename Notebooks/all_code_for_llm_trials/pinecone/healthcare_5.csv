0,spk_0,0.08115,0.480833333,"Hello, everyone. Welcome to. Its becoming an annual, um, meet and greet Q and A session with uh, the CV SD Health and Safety team. My name is Jocelyn Boe. Im one of the school nurses at Shelburne Community School and the COVID coordinator for the Champagne Valley School district and have some wonderful experts uh who are joining us today. So theyre going to introduce themselves."
1,spk_1,0.49665,0.818316667,"So Im also going to chime in, Im Bonnie Bets. Im the Director of Digital Learning and Communication for the district. So Im mostly here to record this meeting and help make sure that others can see it. Uh Lisa and Emily, why dont you all go next and then well have our position."
2,spk_2,0.842483333,0.944816667,Um Im Lisa Bisbee. Im a special educator at Williston Central School in 1/5 through eighth grade team.
3,spk_3,0.969316667,1.02815," And Im Emily mclean. I am a teacher at CBU High
 School"
4,spk_4,1.067333333,1.534316667,"CV U. Sorry. Ch I had a lot of kids go through CV U I, I think I told you once before. I have like hundreds of hours of years, whatever it is. So Im Bill Ras, Im a pediatric infectious disease physician at the University of Ramada. I live in Charlotte and uh have vast experience with the school system there and Im really supportive of everything you do. Its good to see some familiar faces actually. Um um Its nice to be a part of a team. Thanks for inviting me."
5,spk_5,1.565666667,1.88315,"My name is Doctor Elizabeth Hunt and I also live in Charlotte and have three kids at CCS and I help out in the volunteer capacity as the health advisor with the school nurse there and the wonderful leadership team. And Im a general pediatrician in South Burlington, Vermont and joined by one of my partners."
6,spk_6,1.90165,2.176633333,"Im Leah Costello. Im a pediatrician at Timberland Pediatrics with Elizabeth Hunt and I live in Heinsberg. I have two Children that attend Heinsberg community school and I have one child that attends Annette. Um, shes two the daycare right across from CD U."
7,spk_0,2.201983333,2.595666667,"Um I was wondering maybe, um before we jump into kind of our questions, if one of our doctors wants to take a stab at just kind of setting the stage of where were at right now in the COVID landscape in Vermont. And a lot of us left in June and thought we were leaving it behind for schools. And so I think it would be good for us to kind of get in that mindset. Where, what are you seeing and what, what do you think were walking into for the school year?"
8,spk_4,2.615316667,4.729983333,"So if I can, Id love to take a crack at that. I think that there has been tremendous concern across the United States about the surge in infections and the transmissibility of the Delta variant that has really changed our thinking about the virus quite a bit nationally. I think that weve learned that this uh uh variant is much more infectious than previous variants and that people who are not vaccinated or not immune um will become infected. And that were seeing, thats one of the reasons were seeing the surge in cases. Were not entirely sure that the Delta variant is more, at least to more severe disease. We just know that it is much more infectious. Having said that I would say that Vermont is still the safest place in the state. No, the nation to be, we are in good shape compared to everyone else. If you look at our numbers compared to Louisiana, Alabama, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, we are off the charts better, to be honest with you, we really are, we get really excited when there are 100 cases and we have a 3% infectivity rate on people who are testing and theyre symptomatic. Um States would love those kind of numbers. So we do want to reassure families. We really want to assure the nurses, we want the special educators that we, that we can send kids to school, that kids can be in school, that kids need to be in school. Um That this is a good safe environment where we can do lots of things to keep them there. So I dont want people to panic. I dont want people to think that its too dangerous to send their kids to school or that they have to mask at home or something else like that. Were just saying that with the Delta variant, you should just be more cautious about congre and endure, particularly with people you dont know. Uh And, and in school settings, weve been very supportive of masking in the school setting. And I know, you know, the agency of education guidelines about that. But again, there, theres a a rationale for doing that. So we want to reassure parents, we want to reassure them that kids need to be in school, they can be in school safely. We wanna reassure that the vaccines are safe and that at any opportunity we should get shots in arms and we want to support them in their decisions."
9,spk_6,4.760816667,5.790983333,"Id like to piggyback on that question. Thank you, Doctor Rasco. That was great. But we also left in June feeling like we were just not seeing a whole lot of illness last year. And as a general pediatrician in private practice, we have seen a significant amount of infections that we dont typically see in the summer. Um So we are just the landscape is very different. Were seeing RSV and young infants and probably in older kids too. Um Were seeing kids with croup. Were starting to see hand foot and mouth. Were seeing enter virus. Were just seeing some common summer viruses and some uncommon summer viruses. So thats all in this picture with COVID that last year, we saw very little pediatric disease um because of masking and distancing and all the things that we did. But we are now seeing those come back and that is just changing the landscape, um and um changing the amount of quarantine and testing and the things that families need to do that,  I hope well talk about
 tonight."
10,spk_5,5.816483333,7.23515,"We also entered this school year now knowing a lot about vaccines against COVID that protect against SARS COVID. Two health care providers started getting vaccinated last fall, mid fall, late fall. And our, you know, CV U students in 12 and up started in May. And um we know that its a very well tolerated vaccine that it does work vaccinated. Individuals are less likely to get severely ill or hospitalized or have um death. And um in the young, I mean, the percent of adverse effects is super, super, super low. And over time, weve seen many vaccinated students, teachers and parents do very, very well. Um So that provides an additional layer of confidence going into the uh the school year. And we know like what Doctor Costello was saying about the virus is being funkier this year. Its largely because of masking, being so effective. And I would say we talked a lot about masking and concerns about that for the student population, for you educators and think of how well they did this year. They knocked it out of the park. The students were so flexible. Oh, we have this tea, you know, oh, its gonna be like that. I was really, really impressed and empowered by young people this year. And I think thats a, its a better place to start from."
11,spk_0,7.27,7.61765,"I can kind of piggybacking on that about masking. I know that the Vermont chapter of the A AP is really encouraging universal masking in schools. And um again, this is kind of a nationally a hot button topic about, you know, wearing a mask in school and mask mandates. Can you guys talk a little bit about your position on masks in school and, and, and what youre seeing."
12,spk_4,7.664666667,9.992166667,"So uh the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control uh did recommend universal masking. The, we feel fairly strongly that masking really works to prevent transmission. We have great data in schools that when you follow mitigation procedures, we can prevent transmission in school. Yeah, you know, theres a three part, you try not to get let the virus in you prevent transmission and you get it out as quickly as you can with contact tracing. But masking is a central part of that. The 80% rule has some uh background and, and in, in terms, in terms of um what we call an R not value like how transmissible a virus is and how many people need to be protected before you have heard immunity. That number was really generated uh with the original variants that were circulating in the United States. We thought that if you really got to maybe 80% vaccination that maybe you would have a herd immunity. What were learning with the delta variant is that, that may not be the best number any longer and that were seeing more breakthrough cases uh though generally very mild. Um And so there is concern that that may not be a good enough there. And as you can imagine, Jocelyn operational an 80% rule uh is really challenging. So, uh you know, at CCS, which is K through eight, you know, you know, thats, thats a building as they just, just the 7th and 8th graders, are they gonna be allowed to unmask versus no one from, you know, K six? Is it one building? Is it two classrooms extraordinarily challenging? And if you can imagine, you know, thats more competent enough when you have K 38, now youre at a school that straddles the New Hampshire border where you have people crossing the border. How do you figure out whether 80% of the people have been immunized? So, while we understand the rationale behind that, I just think that thats gonna be really challenging and I think that it is just so much more straightforward, easy and appropriate to support universal masking in the school. I would say that be a Bell right now, I was supposed to join a different meeting at six, but Becca Bell is at a different school board meeting where there are a whole bunch of anti maskers and anti vaccinators in the audience uh firebombing them right now. Um Just because thats how controversial the issue is."
13,spk_5,10.04933333,11.73466667,"Well, in terms of tolerance of masking, I mean BSA, I had mentioned that Children were accepting of it and able to comply while still learning, socializing and enjoying the school experience. There were many parents um I think who are concerned about the experience for their child. So maybe Cho chose for remote or we were reluctant to go to hybrid or in person. Um Also, I received a lot of con concerning kind of messages and questions about athletics, temperature change, you know, all of the environmental factors that make wearing a surgical mask or a double layer, cloth mask uncomfortable. I feel like the educational system handled that very well in terms of giving breaks and letting kids know that if they needed to slow down or step away and take a break that they could and we did not see any really dangerous or untoward events in individual kids or the whole population this whole time from masks. And that is once again a a valuable learning experience and I think kids will talk to each other about it. Yeah, its not that bad. You can go to get air if you wear a mask. Um, you know, were, were gonna end up masking a lot more when we have less ventilation, less opportunity to be outdoors. I suspect. So, um, I think using the experience to support, um, people who might be antimaskers. I hadnt heard that term yet. Bill. But, uh, so, um, the kids really are the best teachers I find in this, this kind of situation"
14,spk_0,11.77316667,12.02083333,in addition to masking. Can you think about some other mitigation strategies that you want parents to know about? You want staff to know about? What are some other things that you saw that we were successful from last year that we need to carry over in this coming year?
15,spk_6,12.05181667,13.20233333,"I was, we have to keep sick kids home. Um, and this is really challenging, um, for myself included as a parent. Uh, that as if your child wakes up with the sniffles, it is not allergies, stay home, get tested, um, reach out to your pediatrician or if your child has mild symptom symptoms that you dont feel like you need to contact with your doctor. You can actually just go to the health department sites and test. Um, its easy, its available for kids over 12 months of age. Um, we went to the Waterbury one the other day. It was amazingly smooth and easy, um, for a close contact in our family and tested the whole family. But, um, but we have to stay home if were sick, thats hands down the most important thing and get tested. So, were not bringing COVID into the schools. It is extraordinarily disruptive. Um, if any of you watching this are employers, you need to know that your employees who are parents are gonna need to take more sick time this year. Um, and need to be more attentive to their kids and stay home. Um This year because of not being able to be at school or daycare with any sick symptoms."
16,spk_5,13.268,14.82698333,"Yeah, you hit it spot on and the algorithm that came out is um and it seems like doctor Esky wrote in that there will be a little bit more fine tuning but um just contact your medical home, your school nurse like ah whats this all about? What should we do? You know, its all about getting through this beginning together and asking questions. We have good algorithms. The pop up sites are fine to sign up for free for symptomatic and asymptomatic. Many medical homes are testing, we do them in the parking lot like in our sleep practically. And the algorithms are really helpful. Like weve seen some young kids with teething runny noses like we dont necessarily test them and theyre fine, you know, but most kids who have the symptoms that fall in the the algorithm without being in close contact fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell. Um difficulty breathing, cough, aches, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, those are still, you know, need to be in the, in the forefront. And many employers you, you know, had the COVID sick days and, and I think parents are very understanding if the c a childs teacher needs to be out because theyre not. Well, I would hope they would, you know, continue to support those kind of staffing changes that a school will have to make on the fly to keep kids safe. So staying home when youre sick is extremely important,"
17,spk_4,14.84865,16.70398333,"Jocelyn, the only thing I would add is the immunization strategy remains critical. We need to continue to emphasize immunization and I think theres been a glow somewhat of a go slow movement for Children 5 to 12 or 5 to 11. Uh I can go into that more detail, but Im hoping that we can once, if that does get eau that we can not only school based clinics but pop up sites and as well as the medical home to maximize our opportunities to get vaccines into Children, to encourage the older Children to get their vaccine as well because theyre eligible within the school. I think that therell be contact tracing. The state of Vermont is still committed to contact tracing thats not gonna disappear although other states have abandoned that. Um And so the EpiPen is ready for that. I think that ventilation remain an issue, but were not gonna tell you to redo the hava uh fans dont work. But again, if use the summer, uh the warm weather to open the windows or keep kids outside, I think an issue that comes up is what to do when youre um what to do during dining experiences. And so we continue to recommend that and that if youre unmasked and dining that you should try to separate. But the only time we are talking about any distancing, you know, so the Agency of Education uh two pager did not talk about distancing at all. But we tend to recommend from our point of view that if youre unmasked, you should try to be separate for each other. Were cautious about putting an exact number there, Emily and others because me of the school foundered on 6 ft versus 3 ft. But we just say as best you can, it would be nice if you could maintain 3 ft of distance. And it may be that you have some kids in the classroom and some kids in the cafeteria eating or something like that. But things like plexi class are gonna disappear except at the entrance to the the school where the person checking people and may have that as a barrier."
18,spk_3,16.73266667,17.35633333,"So just to follow up on that, Doctor Raza, um I think school lunchtime is, is a big concern for us who are teachers. Um So maybe we could spend a little bit more time talking about that because as you already stated, the A OE guidance was really spartan. I mean, last year we got a big packet and it had pages and pages with lots of details. And then this year it was a quick little two pager that just said wear a mask and I dont know, it sounds like maybe some new information is coming out from the A OE. But what our doctors thinking is the best advice for health and safety measures when it comes to times during the school day where we have to unmask,  which would
 be eating."
19,spk_4,17.37398333,18.14781667,"So my perspective on this is that when youre unmasked, you should try to indoors, you should try to separate as best you can. Im not worried about Children or adults being unmasked outdoors. So if youre running around playing soccer outdoors or playing tag outside and thats, thats fine. Im not worried about that at all and, and, and then, but, but my recommendation is as best you can to ensure distancing when theyre unmasked. The other things that the, the, the letter was silent but was, you know, are, uh artistic endeavors such as playing music, uh, instruments and singing and, and I dont know what will happen to that. Um But nonetheless, those are some pressure points on the school system at this time. But the biggest issue that I run across is, is just how, how do we eat together?"
20,spk_6,18.20866667,18.63698333,"I think we will rely on our community to be vaccinated. We rely on our community to not send their kids to school with any sick symptoms. And then we do our best to try to separate, um, and knowing that we have those two other things in place that vaccinations and nobody ill in school to help protect both the students and the staff in the school during those times, like eating."
21,spk_3,18.65598333,18.82383333,"And does that, um, change if you have a mostly vaccinated population, which we would have at the high school, unlike at least a school where you have a mix of unvaccinated and vaccinated."
22,spk_4,18.8545,19.52783333,"Well, in theory, if your school has met the 80% criteria, then people dont have to wear a mask and you wouldnt do any mitigation strategies while dining. So thats why Im very careful to say if you are in a masked environment and then you unmask then as best you can usually distance. So Im thinking generally speaking in the Children, 5 to 11, the elementary school age Children, the general recommendation is to mask at all times and so done eating lunch or snacks, whatever is the pressure point in high schools where they have achieved 80% its not gonna be an issue and people will mask if they want to, itll be up to individual decisions"
23,spk_0,19.61066667,20.09081667,"just for some context. Our our 5 to 11 year olds usually eat their lunch in under 10 minutes, I would say. So, you know, thinking about just some, some strategies that we can employ is just kind of when youre done and youre done and youre gonna chat with your neighbor. You can put your mask back on. I think the lunch time is actually 20 minutes. Five of that is getting settled and cleaning up. So its a, it is a pretty short time. But I think that there are some ways that we can look at our system having kids eat in the cafeteria and, and cut down some risk."
24,spk_4,20.10131667,20.44298333,"I think the one we did the original healthy restart, we had, um, some rules that we had to allot 25 minutes for lunch. I dont know whether it was a federal regulation or whatever, but you put, you know, theres always another layer of complexity here, but youre right, theyre not as fast as the seaview high school soccer team eating, but they are pretty quick."
25,spk_0,20.4795,20.86031667,"Um, I was wondering if you can talk as professionals when youre thinking about how you talk to parents who are maybe are on the fence about that vaccination. Um I know that that still remains one of our best strategies for our group. Um So how do you kind of talk to parents who are skeptical about a new vaccine or, or are concerned about the, um, having their child get vaccinated?"
26,spk_5,20.91865,25.60365,"Well, I usually a, a lot of parents feel like its really new for the 12 to 17 year olds. Um And while that cohort received the vaccine later, the vaccine the base moderna and pfizer vaccines for which young people are eligible depending on their age, whether its pfizer or Moderna um, have been around now for almost a year. And so we, we have had time in real life with our population to observe how well tolerated the vaccine has been. Um, I think adverse events in 12 to 17 is like 0.6% something like that, less than 1% based on the research and the trials and in real life. Absolutely. Its, its that low. Um So I kind of say, well, its the same one I got. Its just, you know, and the same is true. Its the same substrate that theyre working on dosing for the 5 to 11 year olds. Um, and that tends to give them pause, like, oh, kind of like the measles vaccine you got is the same one your child got essentially. And um, so that talking point seems to help. And also, um we like, its really, I think, helpful to understand that so much of the unknown when it comes to your child is about doubt and wanting to just erase all doubt. And thats what good parents do. They, they do whats best for their kids and just validate and listen and share that, you know, theyre being a great parent by thinking critically about this and that, like Leah Castello had alluded to, its good to be ready and really feel ready and our job is to help that readiness. Um And just say, well, you know, sometimes I ask, what are you worried about? You know, they say, well, I read this Myocarditis article and um we dont because this is happening in real time. There, there are things we dont know about the COVID vaccine moving through time, but the same is true of the CO COVID infection in the young and long COVID. We believe that the risk of COVID is, is worse than that far worse than that of the COVID vaccine. And um people tend to respond to that. Um Also the fact that MRN A vaccines are not new. Um And that there werent any shortcuts like the way I explained, people really freak out when they realize how quickly this vaccine come out. And I explained that the teams worked harder. They ran all the mai everything happened as a priority day, night, weekends so that the timeline was abbreviated, but there werent scientific shortcuts that would put anyone at risk and um that is helpful. They just dont, theyre like, oh really? Oh, I thought they just skipped steps. Um and then um a lot of teens want to get vaccinated but their parents are apprehensive. And so I have found that turning to the teen and saying, what do you think? What have you heard that a lot of them are just as well as formed, informed as I am and theyre eager and then I like to talk a little bit about what it gets us as a community. So being vaccinated is a commitment to ones neighbors. Its a commitment to prevention. Its a commitment to those who are immunocompromised or cannot be vaccinated. And that um that as a community committing to vaccination is our way out of the dramatic um lifestyle, social and emotional changes that weve all been through for better or for worse. And Doctor Bell whos advocating right now wrote a great letter like a week and a half ago that really highlighted the exacerbation of the pediatric mental health crisis. And we deal just as much with that as we do with COVID concerns, if not more. And that has we have to roll that back. You guys this, this school year as much as we can and um a regular routine being in person connecting with other humans, knowing there are resources, there are supports, there are other people out there who are just as concerned. There are great school nurses and teachers, I think um will really help um with the start. Sorry. That was kind of long.  I
 would add one thing to that. Um"
27,spk_6,25.60981667,26.72183333,"Elizabeth, that was great. I uh long term side effects is another thing that parents bring up. And I think we can really confidently say after decades and decades of research around vaccines that we long term complications is not something that we see or have any concern from in the medical and scientific community, we see um side effects in the first few, 2 to 6 weeks after a vaccination. So the study was adequate to look for any potential complications. But we dont see effects on puberty or fertility or theres just no scientific basis for that. And sometimes even just really talking through why there is no scientific basis for it um helps to parents to maybe not make a decision right there in the moment. But just to think about it more critically and know that were, that there are logical explanations that we can walk through.  Im not sure
 if this is Jocelyn. Could you talk a little bit about um"
28,spk_2,26.72766667,26.821,what kind of uh surveillance testing and things like that is gonna look like? And um
29,spk_0,26.83816667,28.32716667,"so one of, I would say another mitigation strategy that we are going to have out of the gate is testing. And last year when we sat here, we talked about testing and it was that a great strategy. And at that point, our, our states testing capacity um wasnt as robust as it is now, but now were in a much better place and were going to partner with the A OE to offer surveillance testing for all students and staff on a regular basis. And I, I dont have a firm under know, you know, plan of how often. But Im, we did surveillance testing on staff last year every month. And so I imagine we will be doing the same thing. Um If parents are listening, its going to be an opt in, you would have to register your child. Youll get um, you know, a user name and password, you will register your child, you will get the results. Its not something that school will um have results for. But um your school nurses will, will be helping your child get good swab and get that sent out to the Broad Institute in, in Massachusetts. So, um I think that will be one of our, our strategies as a school to catch those asymptomatic cases. You know, we, were hoping not to catch any asymptomatic cases because were hopefully those kids are staying home. But um you know, that will help give us a little bit of um insight into, into what were seeing in, in a population in schools and hopefully catch cases like Doctor Rasa said, you know, before they go  and
 spread"
30,spk_6,28.35731667,28.77265,"and just a reminder that it is so easy to go to the health department sites, whether youre symptomatic or asymptomatic. Um, you actually dont need an appointment. Um You can register for an appointment but you can also wait. Um And they are so easy to go to both in Burlington, Winski, like I said, we went down to Waterbury, but they are all over.  Um And another option for testing.
 Ive been tested so many times."
31,spk_0,28.77281667,29.06373333,"I forget that other people havent. And just so everyone knows its not the big deep brain tickle that we all heard about. Um, last year and everyone was a little fearful of. Its just a little swab inside your nose. Its not painful at all. Um, my own Children have done it so many times. Theyre practically experts. So,"
32,spk_6,29.06573333,29.25823333,"and kids can self swab too. Um, my six year old going into first grade did not want to the other day when we tested, but my nine year old did fine. Um Theyre walking into the room right now. In fact,"
33,spk_5,29.29633333,29.69098333,"yeah, we self swab in our clinic. Um, like two year olds, three, I mean, theyre actually, yeah, it works quite well. And um glad to hear our infectious disease community supports that because you can get a great sample. You just say I need the mucus, like really get it wet, you know. Um And uh yeah, brings, brings them together. Itll work out."
34,spk_3,29.76683333,29.91116667,"Jocelyn. This might be a question for you. Is the district still planning to keep the  COVID dashboard going to report out on
 cases."
35,spk_0,29.92415,31.13,"Yes. At this point, we are planning to keep um our weekly update that Bonnie and I do on the website. Um or we report our cases that are infectious in school. So if somebody isnt infectious in school, we dont necessarily know about that. And so we dont report that people can also look at the department of Health website. They update it twice a week, last school year Im not sure their plan for this year. But if they want to see um cases that are infectious in school, the department of Health reports on that as well. I dont know if this is something that you guys can speak to as, as uh you know, insiders on the V chip team. But can you talk a little bit about the breakthrough cases? I think um you know, our our staff is, is has robust vaccination rates, but there is some ambivalence of being parents of young kids or living with immunocompromised people. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, the likelihood of a breakthrough case and a breakthrough case spreading? I know the governor talked about our percentages on the press conference yesterday, but I dont know if you had some even data."
36,spk_4,31.14548333,33.19948333,"So I think the take home message has been and should be for a long time is that the vaccines work extremely well at preventing severe disease. The vaccine strategy was designed to prevent severe disease. It was a bonus that it prevented infection. I think people are a bit surprised at how effective the vaccines were preventing infection. But from the get go and now they still prevent severe disease, all three licensed vaccines in the United States. What were seeing though is that were seeing a AAA fall in tighter over time and a fall in protection against infection over time and that was shown in Israel would use the Pfizer vaccine almost exclusively and they were very aggressive. And there was just three reports today and then, mmwr which just shows that there is waning protection against infection that the Vermont data has been reassuring, generally said its uncommon. Um Theres some, a little bit more concerning data that a couple of states are really monitoring very carefully, the breakthrough rates. Its and now its taking up a slightly higher percentage of cases than an unvaccinated because historically, this has been, this wave has been the wave of the unvaccinated. To be honest with you. Its still primarily that, but we are seeing an uptick in people who have breakthrough cases. They tend to be a bit older to be with you. They tend to have more immuno compromising conditions. But no, unless its there. And the, the rationale for actually, um the booster, I would say that most people entering school are actually not in that high risk category that uh most of them, you know, that the teams werent the eau wasnt even until March, you know, um things like that. So III I do think that there is some breakthrough, but again, were, its designed to prevent severe infections. We dont know quite how infectious people are with bright breakthrough infections because thats been hard to sort out. We do know that they have relatively similar amounts of virus in their nose. Um as those people who uh have not been immunized and become infected, but we dont have great data on exactly how transmissible they are."
37,spk_5,33.26598333,33.82783333,"And thats unfortunately just another wave of how this has to be managed. You know, if you read the A OE two pager, its about kind of managing COVID and doing our best to prevent serious outcomes and bolster vaccination and, um, educate Children and keep them feeling safe and healthy. Um, its not like a switch you can flip. Weve seen, um,"

39,spk_6,34.1693,35.77916667,"School is really important um And can be safe. I think we did this last year really well. Um and really um led the nation in our vaccination efforts, led the nation in keeping our kids in school more than most of my friends across the country had their Children in school. Um What weve done for Vermont kids is remarkable and we really can continue to do that, but its a community effort. Um All those who are eligible must get the vaccine. If your child is sick, please keep them home and get tested and wear your mask when youre indoors. Um Its a much smaller set of steps this year. Um And that we can get our kids really safely back in school. Even I feel confident that your Children, if youre a teacher who happens to get a breakthrough case that school, you being in school teaching and your Children being in school is still just really the benefits far outweigh the risks. Um And that even though were in an, we have a hot more transmissible variant, that does not mean 100% of kids get it. If it comes into a classroom, that is not what it means. And with these small efforts, we can make that risk even much lower. Um And Im really excited for kids to go back to school and see them in the classroom and see them doing more. Im so excited for my daughter to go into the art room. Shes never gone. Shes starting first grade and shes never been to the library or the art room and here we go. Um Itll be so exciting in music class."
