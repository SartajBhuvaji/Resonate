1,0.1,0.1173166666666666,spk_1,"Uh Yeah, thank you."
2,0.1353166666666666,0.2175,spk_2,"Any specific position, Ill just sit your way up there. Well, Andre is just,"
3,0.2355,0.28265,spk_1,"um, Ill show some slides."
4,0.5378333333333334,0.5584833333333333,spk_0,Its all very natural.
5,0.60765,0.67465,spk_2,"Yeah, its a bit strange. Yeah."
6,0.7233333333333333,0.7573166666666666,spk_1,"Yeah, I think its  no bad like
 this"
7,0.8101666666666667,0.8275,spk_0," and dont forget
 the,"
8,0.9118166666666668,2.933666666666667,spk_1,"um, so hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this meeting. Um, well, as you all know, the topic of this mornings meeting is, uh, the fact that were moving and were going to get more space. So thats a very good piece of news. Uh, but we also have to find out how we use this space. So, um, if you want, Ill just give a brief overview of whats happening and then we can, uh, talk about well, arranging these new, uh, the new office space. So, um, in case you havent seen the, the document, uh, let me just, uh, show you very briefly the, the configuration of the, the space. So, um, well, there is nothing much to say. Well, you know how many of usa reare present and you know that we a re, um, a bit tight actually in our present location. Uh Thats why actually, the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the uni building. So its a t the sixth floor and its a set of contiguous rooms as you, you can all see from uh from here. Um So the, the, the one P, two P three P means the, the number of persons as you can see we have. So a corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms of one person rooms, two person room and, and three person rooms. Um Actually, I think Agnes did this nice drawing. So she even put the, the views. So we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the other two sides. Uh We have some bathrooms for us. Uh and the courtyard, which actually means a sort of uh shaft because uh the court is uh down a t the,  the first floor
 and just uh just a clarification question, a re the"
9,2.93615,3.1863166666666665,spk_2,"number of people per room indicated strict or can we play around with? I mean, if there a ree two people, is it really that you cant put three or uh 2.5 or uh how, how was it?  Well,
 its a bit difficult to say because um in fact,"
10,3.1865,4.741333333333333,spk_1,"we have some constraints in terms of furniture. Uh theyre here. So, um well, your, your person, your, your question actually is answered maybe by the third item. So each person should get. Um Well, its a sort of desk, its made of two pieces and it looks like a corner with, of course, a chair, uh, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk. Uh, and, well, we can put hanging shelves over the, the desks. So Im not really sure. Its possible to get 33 desks in a two person office. But, um, we could try whats, what should be said here. I dont know if, well, you, I, I will maybe distribute now documents if you dont have them, maybe its easier. Do you need something, Martin? We can keep this for you. Uh So its, its, yeah, you have a copy, Susan, you to David. I think so. In fact, there a re more places than people. So we wont be that constrained uh as you know, some of us and some of you here actually Martin David a re part time. So it, its for the moment, quite comfortable. Normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for, you know, temporary people coming to work on uh on projects. Uh Yeah, I uh yeah, I counted so we have um 15 pers physical persons and about uh 16, I think uh persons or actually 18 persons in the offices,"
11,4.74515,4.7726500000000005,spk_2,"counting the re the, the reading room."
12,4.781333333333333,5.271,spk_1,"Exactly. So one of the issues uh here, its probably not on the slides is that we would like to have uh unlike what we had until now a lounge or reading room. Um, I, one of the, the offices. So in one of the rooms do we really need to? Um, I think quite a lot of people express the need for that. So if we could do it, I think it would be much nicer.  Um, let me also, uh, s say something. Dont forget
 the time we spend"
13,5.281833333333333,5.85665,spk_2,"to, for discussions about that room to be able to authorize this if possible. Yeah, I I still with you that the the we a re not so we a re not so large as far as space is concerned uh because 15 people to put in their 18 positions. So uh to the best uh if you take uh two people room for the reading room, then you have  well, 1616
 play slots for 15 people. So it still should be feasible. That also means that the growth will be zero."
14,5.872316666666666,6.004166666666666,spk_1,"Yeah, I think thats quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can think of. Yeah, some two or three for visiting people."
15,6.051166666666667,6.0521666666666665,spk_2,Mmhmm.
16,6.063983333333334,7.54415,spk_1,"Okay. So let me finish with the the constraints which a re almost done. So we also need to, to find a, a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine and the printer, the fax you know, is very small but um the photocopier is quite huge and the printer is uh well this size um okay, the offices come with white boards, not very uh very important. Uh The furniture that each, each person has and, uh, you have a list of people. So, the thing, uh, you, you ought to know is that were not the only ones that we a re think that, that a re thinking about, uh, far, well, about putting people inin these rooms. Um, there is another group that is also having discussions. So the idea is that today well just sort of start seeing the main constraints and then you have time to, to go and think about it. Uh ask the people, you know, your assistants for instance, and A t the next meeting, well try to, to come with one solution. Uh The other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation.  So, and
 if we dont get this space, then what happens? Uh if you, if we dont get these, um, well, basically they a re promised to us. So, uh do, do you think there a re chances that they take from us, one of the rooms or? Uh okay. Yeah. II, I think its uh"
17,7.556833333333333,7.618833333333333,spk_2,"no, the, the, the chance it might be that there a re more people to put in that space? Yeah."
18,7.6245,8.299816666666667,spk_1,"Yeah, thats one of the, the problems I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people, one being temporary or, or part time. Um ok. So maybe we could try to, to see now what would be the main options, say the general uh well, arrangement options. Do you think that we should put people say according to projects, for instance, inin the table that um that we have, uh we also have the uh uh the, the main projects on which the people a re working.  So how
 Andre sorry for interrupting."
19,8.3,8.725966666666666,spk_2,"But uh one again, clarification question, what is the real margin of maneuver that we have for these discussions? Because uh a t least we a re a half percent, 50% of from EPFL. And uh sometimes you have meetings where the, the, the decision is already taken. So, uh and uh you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things. So what, what will be the impact of what we will come out?  Oh,
 actually,"
20,8.726133333333333,9.118133333333333,spk_1,"what is fixed is the n the number of rooms this week cannot really change? I mean, a T least not us. It would be much more difficult to get another, another room for instance. But what is absolutely not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms? So basically, we a re all the permutations, a re possible. That  other way of
 asking the question, is there any other group already working on the,"
21,9.1183,9.266,spk_2,"on the, how this should be uh should be allocated or a re we, the, the one that is supposed to do the, the, the position? Well,"
22,9.26615,9.531666666666666,spk_1,"what we a re looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy. So, uh the other group is, I, I dont think we have to see them as competitors but they a re just trying to, to find another local optimum or why,  why
 dont they have any representative here?"
23,9.543166666666666,9.567483333333334,spk_2,Yeah. Why didnt we have a meeting together and
24,9.596166666666669,9.718316666666666,spk_3,"then, uh, uh Andrea and, and will discuss about it with a, you a re, the rep representative of this group."
25,9.720483333333334,10.203333333333331,spk_1,"Yeah. Uh, we, yeah, I think thats, yeah, there is no real competition between the two, but well just try to find a t least two solutions and see how, how close they a re actually, its, its, I think, well, the, the people who, who decided this thought it was the best solution to, well, you know, find 22 kinds of opinions. Yeah. Well, we could have been eight sitting around here and, and talking but I think its, its more difficult.  Yeah.
 But, you know, that, thats the standard thing."
26,10.2035,10.464316666666669,spk_2,"Its suppose that somebody, for some strange reasons want to be in the corner and we dont know about that. Well put them, put her or him somewhere else, then we will do plenty of work for nothing because well not have this constraint. We aware of this constraint."
27,10.470833333333331,10.75715,spk_1,"Exactly. I think so. So today, the goal is not to, to find a solution today, but set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences. Obviously we wont be able to accommodate all the, the preferences,  but a t least well find the most, uh, the most important
 ones."
28,10.758666666666668,10.9305,spk_0,"Well, certainly we have to ask, uh, and, uh, and Maggie since theyre not here because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do. And so thats another consideration too."
29,10.940833333333334,12.09015,spk_1,"Yeah, I think so. Thats one of the things I think we know that they have students. We dont know exactly if they prefer for instance to be alone or to, well to be with their assistant or even with another person working on the project. So that would have been maybe another solution is to ask everyone to provide a, an arrangement. But uh I think thats a bit uh a bit hard then to, to work out. Um So since all of you have a copy of the uh well of the drawing, I think for the next time, maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with uh na mes on it. But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people say by projects or just professor and assistant. So what would be say first, your preferences since lets, lets start with us. Maybe today. Um What do you think about it? Would you prefer to be alone? Would you prefer to be with your assistant? You who a re part time? Do you think you can come here on a very well regular schedule or is it part time but variable during the week?"
30,12.115316666666669,12.390316666666669,spk_3,"Yeah. Uh, ok. Uh, me personally, I would like to, to, to share the, the p, the room with the assistants as when you have problems of normal life. Like, uh, the printer doesnt work. I dont want to ask this to my supervisor. So its better to, to be with, uh, with an assistant to share the room."
31,12.408333333333331,12.6085,spk_1,"Uh huh. And since youre coming on, um, half time, do you think you will be able to group your presence here? Say Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, or is it going to be m much more random?"
32,12.608666666666666,12.744166666666668,spk_3,"I dont think its a good idea to share a, to, to share the SA me desk. Okay. Uh, I still would like to have my drawers and these things."
33,12.761666666666668,13.050166666666666,spk_1,"Yeah, I think so too. Um, so Martin you a re also, um, half time and, well, the third person is Gisela. I think its quite clear that each person should have their own desk and  its no, no way. We, we could put two persons a t the sa me
 desk."
34,13.056983333333331,13.950166666666666,spk_2,"WW, where part time is important is that its no, no low load on the room. So, for sure if you have a part time person that reduces the, the ranges of time where too many people a rin the room. Yeah, I think I probably might be able to have a kind of a regular presence here. Um The uh, the thing that fin my case has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls. So Ill be talking o over the phone all the time. So thats not necessarily, well, it depends on, I, I have nothing against sharing a, a, an office with somebody I already did it before. So, and it was perfectly fine. It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the in the room, which is very much dependent on people. Some people a re not disturbed a t all by this, some people just cant work"
35,13.965833333333334,14.042166666666668,spk_1,"a re you disturbed by the phone calls of other people. Im not.  But
 uh"
36,14.045166666666669,14.532333333333334,spk_2,"and uh what might happen but it uh it will not be so heavy here, uh a tio as visitors so that I will have more a TEPFL uh typically students coming in or asking for things as Im not teaching here. Im teaching a TEPFL. This should, shouldnt be a such a big load. So for me, it, it will be essentially, I will not be, I will not be able to be silent in the room because I will be communicating also through vocal means. So"
37,14.546,15.165833333333332,spk_0,"before um talking more about individual preferences, is there any possibility what they have done in the uh Faculty of Law for exa MP that they actually split rooms? And so we would take uh one of the two people rooms and split it and you would see that you would have the sa me size office, but that would give the privacy um in so far as in just about every other faculty in the building, every professor has their own office. And its, its really uh goes a bit far that we have to have this uh all the sharing. Uh so one option and that, but that we would need to ask about if we could uh split one of the rooms"
38,15.18015,15.274,spk_2,"for boxes, for instance, in the, in the bigger rooms where you like cubicles"
39,15.289483333333331,15.483983333333333,spk_0,"that doesnt really solve it. I mean, theres, theres really a difference in having to have your own. Yeah. And sometimes you have, uh you need to have private discussions with somebody or whatever. So,"
40,15.498,16.336833333333335,spk_1,"yeah, II I will try to find out whether we can separate, I think for the moment, the answer a t least is no because, um, its not only well making a wall but also making a new door. So its quite a lot of uh, of work. But um, I will try to find this out for the next time. Um So a t least for the moment as you can see there a re uh I can show them here on the screen. So there a re these two rooms on the left that uh accommodate one person. So a t least some of the professors since you a re four, could, could go, well, could take these, uh, these rooms and quite a lot of rooms with two persons. Uh, how do you feel Susan about the professor sharing the room with her assistant? So, the one which is the most involved in, in the teaching?  Well, I, I
 think its really a matter of personal preference as, you know, um,"
41,16.336983333333333,16.776333333333334,spk_0,"I prefer to have my own office. Um, I also have a lot of phone calls and, you know, have to see people and with the other work that Im doing with the rhetoric, uh that is really confidential information that Im treating. So I, that I have to be really careful about too, but its a personal preference uh in so far as what weve had up until now, both Maggie and Pierrette have been happy to share with others. So, I mean, I think that we should still check with them. I"
42,16.78015,16.883333333333333,spk_2,"fully agree with that. Thats uh its much easier to me to uh to foresee having two people of the same position, sharing a room"
43,16.897483333333334,16.94265,spk_0,"but not sharing with each other.  They
 sharing with their"
44,16.95615,17.253316666666667,spk_2,"students because that, thats, its, its tricky because of confidentiality reasons. As you said, you, you a re discussing a budget on the, on the project, you over the phone. Typically you dont necessarily want to have somebody who will be dependent on the budget being part of the discussion. So"
45,17.2905,17.53715,spk_1,"yeah, thats um thats true. Um, okay. Um, maybe we could look a bit a t the projects. Do you think its a good idea to put together in the SA Me Room as much as possible? People from the SA ME projects, since they talk quite a lot of the"
46,17.539833333333334,17.692166666666665,spk_2,"project doesnt last in time. They will change. Its the only thing that will not, uh, that will change only progressively in time is the status of the people."
47,17.71998333333333,17.807483333333334,spk_1,"Well, yeah, and some of the phd students will hopefully they will finish their phd A T some point."
48,17.849816666666666,17.85165,spk_2,Mmhm
49,17.866666666666667,18.261333333333333,spk_0,"Yeah. And also some of our the people mentioned here a re working on more than one project too. So for example, Marianne the fin shes also working with me on the virtual campus project. So she that one wasnt mentioned. Im not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office. But uh its just to say people are working on uh sometimes more than one project.  If
 it, if it, if projects are what you have in mind,"
50,18.26148333333333,18.4829,spk_2,"I think that the meeting room is the the tool for that you need to have people in the project talking together, they just have a meeting room. If its not too far away, then then its a very good well actu so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room."
51,18.483066666666662,18.647066666666667,spk_1,"But there a re also more formal meeting rooms available inin the building as  why I was
 quite receptive to uh Susans remark. A t the beginning is"
52,18.655483333333333,18.969666666666665,spk_2,"I wouldnt formulate it in uh such uh an extreme way as do we really need a lounge? But uh I would probably formulate it in a way that uh do we want to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room? Because, because meeting rooms to me, a re very important tools to do uh collaborative work."
53,18.989316666666667,19.14965,spk_1,"But I think we need to have to relax. So thats, and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge,  which is a
 whole other topic."
54,19.1625,19.340333333333334,spk_0,"No, I um the lounge. Okay. But I think we need to also see it as a overflow place when we have um uh visitors for any length of time.  So they actually have a place to work
 cause thats really my,"
55,19.3405,19.557,spk_2,"one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that its, it pro provides no possible possibilities of expansion and this will happen. I mean, you cant, you cant prevent having visitors  and you
 should."
56,19.565166666666663,19.666833333333333,spk_1,"Yeah. Yeah. For the moment, actually, I think only one slot would be fully free. Uh That is for"
57,19.669666666666668,19.6885,spk_2," people. Its not
 enough."
58,19.69065,19.7525,spk_1,"Yeah, that means one visitor a T A time or one intern. Yeah, that"
59,19.76615,19.80998333333333,spk_2,"professors here and, and, and its funny"
60,19.8135,19.88833333333333,spk_3,that we building because we run out of space and we will have the sa me problem.
61,19.905483333333333,19.980166666666666,spk_0,"Yes. But we have more space here than what we  currently have. Yeah, its
 already a progress"
62,19.98515,20.15598333333333,spk_1,"and youre, youre working. Uh, I think, yeah. W okay. So, one of the things I have to do for the next time is find,  find out about the separations between rooms
 because this"
63,20.15615,20.23583333333333,spk_2,"is really related with security regulation as well. I mean, you cant just put walls inin rooms."
64,20.24315,20.323,spk_1,"Yeah, I think its quite a heavy  transformation of the building, not
 necessarily heavy in terms of work."
65,20.323666666666668,20.368483333333334,spk_2,Its heavy in terms of administrative authorisation
66,20.384,20.57015,spk_1,"and okay, Ill try to find out. And the other question is,  can we squeeze maybe four people in the A or a t least four places in the 33 p
 room?"
67,20.570316666666667,20.647816666666667,spk_2,"I think. So if you organise the desks in a, in a intelligent way,"
68,20.661483333333333,20.96615,spk_1,"yeah, hopefully visitors dont need as much say, filing space or uh yeah, they dont have that many papers. Uh Okay. So thats uh I have to, to ask. So you dont really feel um very strongly attached to this uh grouping by project idea. Mmhmm."
69,20.978,21.06798333333333,spk_0,"No, because they can share their ideas across the project and  its uh coffee
 machines that they made for them."
70,21.086983333333333,21.251816666666667,spk_3,"Yeah. Usually when, when newer assistants come, they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh uh its related with the project. So you can"
71,21.25565,21.652833333333334,spk_2,"see thats proximity doesnt play a big role there. You can discuss with people and the space is very small. I mean, all together its, and uh you dont, you, you dont need to discuss about the projects. You f more need about the, to discuss about where is the printer? How do I get furniture? Im, I dont have a, a pencil. Where is the, the box with the pencils and so on? This is not project related."
72,21.699816666666667,21.886,spk_0,"You know, if you look now at the, at the, the current division of the offices, for example, uh Bruno and Agnes are sharing an office and theyre working on totally different projects and then theyre, theyre just fine with that."
73,21.90615,22.16933333333333,spk_1,"Yeah, I think thats, thats going to be one of the, the main things well have to ask is whether people have strong preferences, either in staying with someone or in, uh not staying, um, a re you aware of any strong constraints right now?"
74,22.17183333333333,22.36865,spk_0,"Well, there, there were, but they sort of disappeared as of October when, you know, smoking because before we were smokers and now that theres no smoking, I guess thats not very important option though."
75,22.3755,22.45198333333333,spk_1,"Ok. Yeah, thats true. So, smoking is now no longer a constrain."
76,22.45365,22.51448333333333,spk_0,"Well, except for maybe you dont want anybody smoking on your balcony. So,"
77,22.54433333333333,22.623,spk_3,"is it allowed to smoke inside an office if its one person? Not anymore? No, its"
78,22.63665,22.761166666666668,spk_0,"in principle, its a, its a no smoking building, you can smoke outside so you can go outside onto the, not even"
79,22.797316666666667,22.84098333333333,spk_1," regulation for
 all of the 6000 students on"
80,22.842816666666668,22.846666666666668,spk_2,"the roof,"
81,22.87333333333333,22.9425,spk_1,"uh, on the balcony. Actual,  normally
 theres the, theres that terrace"
82,22.947316666666666,22.947816666666668,spk_0,but
83,22.95531666666667,23.071,spk_3,"just, theres no place inside the building, its a no smoking campus but there a re some places"
84,23.080816666666667,23.7005,spk_2,"still, some places where can see but, and just about, about your, your previous uh request. I, I don think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesnt want to be with whom thats a typical uh output of ex uh research and expert systems. These a re the rules that youll never get, but uh you can get them through a proposal. So you propose a set up where people a re with other peoples and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that uh they dont want to have a view on the mountains, but they prefer to have view on the old town.  So they
 on the toilets, they would prefer to be in another."
85,23.710316666666667,24.005316666666666,spk_0,"We, we do have one constraint thats difficult, which is um Gisela because when shes there, shes very noisy. Part of the nature of her work that uh yes, Martin said also for him and yeah, especially for her."
86,24.00815,24.059,spk_1,"Yeah, the I shes the interface.  And
 so thats a problem."
87,24.059166666666663,24.564833333333333,spk_2,"Youre right because, because we dont have a one person, we d we dont have enough one person rooms for accommodating the uh the admin place. And if you put two person persons or three persons for the admin space, who who, who else will you put in there? Because we dont have any uh system manager or we dont have, we have only one half, part, half time, uh admin and no other non researcher positions if Im not mistaken. And this is really a piece of a problem. Maybe you could put some visitors. But, um,"
88,24.584,24.823666666666668,spk_1,"yeah, I, uh realistic. Inainain, I think putting Gisela with the other admin of the school is not an option because we werent offered. Yeah, it would be nice. But uh okay, Ill try to find out but uh  the research
 there,"
89,24.82783333333333,24.909983333333333,spk_2,lets just either you lose one position or you find another admin or assistant manager.
90,24.9295,24.994,spk_1,"Yeah, I  mean,
 there is certainly enough space uh down the hall"
91,24.998833333333334,25.1485,spk_0,"with all of those uh uh offices that a re where half of them a re also half time and theyre very under used.  So, um
 okay, well try but all these, yeah, a re"
92,25.152166666666663,25.50965,spk_1,"say sort of difficult questions because they involve changing also the offices of the school and, you know, people just dont wanna change in general. Um Lets see, maybe we can find some temporary, well, a t least a proposal for Gisela. So since the one person rooms a re quite well sort of um desired by a lot of people, she  should
 probably"
93,25.52083333333333,26.17716666666667,spk_2,"there a re to me there, a re two options possible is either we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin because some of typically the professors have good reasons for sharing, sharing either with a colleague or sharing uh with some of their uh one of their phd students. In that case, its, its realistic, then we could very, very simply uh allocate the one pers one of the one person rooms for the admin. And that would solve the problem. The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin. That could be the one, close to the, close to the, um,  here in the centre. So, uh, the, the,
 the middle one here"
94,26.18,26.228,spk_1," but
 the no, no, no, the other one, the, the one up. Yeah, this"
95,26.23,26.59115,spk_2,"one. Ok. But then uh that the, the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open. So I would be, I would be more of the opinion to, to see whether its, its so evident that lets say the A t least the two full, full time professors that a re here on the list, we have one here. But uh Maggie is, is not present if they really,"
96,26.61415,26.630316666666666,spk_1,"yeah, if,"
97,26.632166666666667,26.871666666666663,spk_2,"if, because of personal preferences, they would be happy with a two person room which might or might not be the case. I mean, its, its certainly not uh, something that we should impose, but we can ask.  Yeah,
 because in this case, yeah,"
98,26.875833333333333,26.9905,spk_1,"Gisela could take one of the, the two person rooms and the other place would be for some kind of visitor,  but its not
 realistic neither."
99,26.99065,27.08783333333333,spk_2,"I mean, you have, you have a for foreign researcher coming visiting you and you will put, put him in the admin office."
100,27.09583333333333,27.188,spk_1,"Okay.  Uh, youll not
 do that. I mean, uh, maybe you can do that with an exchange student."
101,27.188166666666667,27.33065,spk_2,"Thats ann but you cant take a senior visitor and, uh, to sit him in the, in the  secretary
 we, we invite"
102,27.343316666666663,27.359816666666667,spk_0,"and then we say, OK, you can."
103,27.396166666666662,27.744816666666665,spk_1,"Yeah, OK. Okay. So this sets a bit the stage for uh for Gisela then uh yeah, well try to, to find out. Um Actually, yeah, maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors A T the A T the school actually share their office with their assistant.  So it looks like sort of an implicit tradition, maybe not to be
 for"
104,27.74683333333333,27.777666666666665,spk_0,every other faculty.
105,27.78515,27.79531666666667,spk_1,OK.
106,27.813983333333333,28.15833333333333,spk_0,"Yes, it is. So every other faculty as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know and thats in um in law, socio economics. Uh OK. Its uh they all have their own office, I mean, and, and the,  and the law faculty, they a best they have
 done,"
107,28.160316666666667,28.24266666666667,spk_2,"as we said, its, its really a matter of personal preference. It cannot be something else it can be imposed for sure."
108,28.273,28.569666666666667,spk_1,"Um Okay, so I think, well, this sets a bit the, the stage. Uh could we try? So could you try please to uh do you want an extra uh piece of paper, maybe try to, well,  think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you
 again."
109,28.570833333333333,28.90748333333333,spk_2,"Uh uh Andre, I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our, for ourselves. I can tell you according to what I know now where I would like or would be ready to be, but I really dont see how I could decide for, uh, Maggie or Pierre  or whoever
 else on the list"
110,28.913166666666665,29.038,spk_1,"was to try to, well, just talk to them like  we do
 it like for, for the, the set up of meetings. You, you,"
111,29.04298333333333,29.2195,spk_2,"everyone received that and, uh, should provide. Yeah, I would like to be here and then you will have this multi constrained problem and, uh, you work during two hours and"
112,29.241316666666663,29.301,spk_1,"you ask people just for their place or also for the other peoples places,"
113,29.324483333333333,29.3525,spk_2,the thing you want to know.
114,29.367166666666662,29.409333333333333,spk_1," But what
 about the, the, the cafeteria? I mean, we a re going to pay"
115,29.411816666666667,29.50483333333333,spk_3,us a cafeteria with a projector and all this all together or living its all together.
116,29.538166666666665,30.20115,spk_2,"But thats an open question. Whether its a, its a, its a, it, a t the origin, it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, uh, reading the newspapers, t cetera, et cetera. Uh, there has been a very long discussion about that. I think sh uh, this discussion is still vivid that some of the people I bel belong to these people would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure. But also a meeting room if necessary. Or as uh Susan said, a room, an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for, for, for, for work because you dont have any other place to do it. But thats, thats really an open discussion that, that I think no decision, no final."
117,30.214316666666665,30.460833333333333,spk_1,"Okay, then taken about that. Okay, then for the next time uh trying to come up either with your own preferences, thats quite easy probably to state now that, you know, the constraints or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be, I mean, the"
118,30.462666666666667,30.496,spk_2,one that I dont want you have in the next room.
119,30.49948333333333,30.905816666666663,spk_1,"Well, just discuss it. Yeah, for instance, I mean, no, no, I was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this. And I think, yeah, it would be nice to, to come with maybe a sketch of, of these. If you can do slides, its even better. But uh dont be that formal and uh well try to a t least build up one coherent proposal and well merge it with the other one when the other one is available."
120,30.916666666666668,30.94098333333333,spk_0,Ill ask um uh
121,30.9795,30.98,spk_1,"that,"
122,31.01815,31.12398333333333,spk_2,"that, that of course, is one of the main, well, not main, but one of the important  features
 that we need to. Yeah,"
123,31.128316666666667,31.155166666666663,spk_0,"theyre not a t the meeting. I think its, uh,"
124,31.16815,31.184166666666663,spk_1,and Ill try to
125,31.20115,31.27015,spk_3,"just before finishing. Uh, I mean, we have a cafeteria  or we dont need a t
 all,"
126,31.286,31.31883333333333,spk_1,what do you mean by cafeteria? Exactly.
127,31.321166666666667,31.367816666666663,spk_3,"What, uh, we can take a coffee also."
128,31.382816666666667,31.40683333333333,spk_2,There is no coffee in the reading room.
129,31.41998333333333,31.46165,spk_1," We can bring your coffee in the reading
 room and"

131,31.494333333333334,31.80258333333333,spk_1,"So, so since maybe youre part time here and part time, part time. A tepfl there a reat least two coffee machines in the building. One A T the third floor, one A T the first floor and we can close our coffee, no uh automatic uh coffee machine. Ok. So uh yeah,  no, theres
 the cafeterias downstairs"
132,31.806066666666663,31.936733333333333,spk_0,"but they close A T five. The main problem. Yeah, but theres the two machines and theyre uh the vending machines where you just put the"

134,31.9949,32.19591666666667,spk_1,"yeah, maybe this is not a very bad timing. Could we try to meet um next um, next Tuesday, maybe a T th maybe a bit later, maybe a T 11 oclock."
135,32.218066666666665,32.220733333333335,spk_0,"Um,"
136,32.24115,32.430166666666665,spk_1,"come on, try, try to be nice. Give me a reason. Um We have, dont forget we have the other meeting, the MD M meeting in the morning."
137,32.43031666666667,32.4925,spk_0,So it would have to be in the afternoon. We have a meeting
138,32.503483333333335,32.63216666666667,spk_2,"that might be where is the meeting. Its Yeah. Okay.  So yeah, yeah, then it could be
 930 but we could do,"
