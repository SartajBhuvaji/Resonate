 time. Ok."
spk_1,2.018816666666667,2.242566666666667,"Um, and this is for Mondays, right? Yeah, just Monday. Just Mondays. Ok. Well, I mean, is there anything else that you think that you might be able to plan or down or is there a different day that you might be able to work or something?"
spk_3,2.2434000000000003,2.3035666666666668," Um, why do you work Saturdays instead of Monday?
 Saturdays instead of Mondays?"
spk_1,2.30375,3.1415,"Well, I do have down here on our schedules that Susie is the normal person who works on Saturdays. Um, what you could do, I guess is you could talk to her and see if maybe shed be willing to switch if shes not willing to switch. Um, I mean, I guess well just have to play it by ear if that happens. Um, what I could maybe start doing is on Monday scheduling you a half an hour later. Which, but shed be losing those hours, which probably you dont want. So go and talk to Susy about that first, see what she thinks. And then, um, I guess after that we can just kind of see what happens. Um, and then I did write you up before. I dont, did you know that? No, I didnt know that. Oh, ok. Um, I ga I gave Jim the paperwork thats the paperwork that he doesnt have."
spk_0,3.1574833333333334,3.1906666666666665,"Um, my name is David actually."

spk_1,3.3245,4.057666666666667,"need me here? Uh you know what, Im just gonna wrap this up in like two seconds and then well be done. Ok. So um David has the first write up that we gave of you. So, and I actually of course, forgot the write up that I was gonna give you today. This is just the last one that Ill give you just, you know, letting you know that youre late and all that jazz. Um, so just sign this and Ill, Ill type up something with that later and then you can read it when you get it. Ill send you a copy of what I put together. But anyways I, you know, just make sure just keep watching yourself on time, talk to Susie, see what works out with that if not come back to me, well figure something out. And um yeah, so go out to work. Have a good day.  All right.

spk_2,4.171166666666667,4.475666666666667,"Hi there, Jessica Jessica. This is Dana. I am a human resource assistant. Shell be taking notes on the meeting today and this is Bill. Hes our human resource manager and hell be helping me conduct a disciplinary meeting. Thank you for giving us 10 minutes of your time. Did you get my email regarding the disciplinary meeting today?"
spk_3,4.479833333333334,4.5136666666666665,"Yes, this is because Ive been late a couple of times. Mhm."
spk_4,4.53265,5.810666666666666,"Jessica, both your coworkers and your supervisors have observed you being late. Our records indicate that you have clocked in over five minutes late four days this month on September 21st, you were seven minutes late on Tween the 28th. You were 12 minutes late on the fifth. We have you arriving at eight minutes late and this past Monday the 12th, we have you clocking in at 14 minutes late. To your knowledge. Are these records correct? Mandy and your other supervisors have performed you. What a hard worker and a dedicated worker you are when youre here. Um Our goal is not to let you go, but to improve your tardiness problem. Uh Youve been given two verbal warnings and one written warning. Uh, here at the Nebraska Country Club, we have a policy that states five unexcused absences in one year leads to termination. Uh because we are an equal opportunity employer. The same punishments must apply to all. Do you acknowledge that youre aware of this policy? Ive been informed? Ok. Uh Do you have any questions about it? No, I dont. Ok. Are there any mitigating circumstances that youd like us to consider?  Um,
 well, I just started taking classes on Mondays and I come right from class to work"
spk_3,5.8125,5.8513166666666665,and with traffic sometimes I just cant make it here on time.
spk_4,5.853666666666667,6.030833333333334,"Ok, thank you for that information. Um Well, weve noticed that all tardies have been on Mondays. Do you feel like a schedule change might be uh helpful for the situation?"
spk_3,6.0375,6.163483333333334,"I think thatd be really helpful if maybe I could pick up Saturday and not work Mondays, I can make it on time every Saturday.  I feel like we can work that out. Is
 that a problem?"
spk_4,6.182149999999999,6.939983333333333,"Im glad we came to this solution. But um, as you know, from the email, we stated that a disciplinary action must still be given. Uh, here we have your final write up. Uh, the content states that you understand our policy and no determination is the next step if the problem isnt resolved. Uh Ill give you a moment to read it over and then you can go ahead and sign if you agree. Ok. Uh This time next month, were gonna do a follow up meeting with you and Mandy to see how the new schedule is working out for you and make sure were going towards our goal of no tardies. Uh If you have any further questions or comments about our meeting day or just in general, feel free to call or email me. Uh Heres my card."
spk_2,6.96815,7.053833333333333,"Well, thanks for meeting with us today. We appreciate it. Thank you.  I
 really am sorry, Ive been late. What happened again? No problem."
