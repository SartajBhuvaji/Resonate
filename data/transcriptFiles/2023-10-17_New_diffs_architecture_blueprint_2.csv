0,21.07898333,21.08731667,spk_0,um
1,21.10948333,21.11448333,spk_0,"Yeah,"
2,21.12615,21.14233333,spk_0,I can see that coming.
3,21.14531667,21.15716667,spk_0,Um
4,21.17831667,21.21581667,spk_0,"So yeah, so that's my thoughts. Uh"
5,21.21865,21.29,spk_0,"But we should definitely discuss it in the, in the issue and uh try to advance that"
6,21.30033333,21.32133333,spk_0,uh a sequence.
7,21.3315,21.37533333,spk_0,"I'll, I'll share my thoughts there on that issue too."
8,21.39515,21.40933333,spk_0,Any more?
9,21.41415,21.45948333,spk_0,Anyone has any more thoughts here today?
10,21.5875,21.60716667,spk_0,"All right, let's try to make"
11,21.61848333,21.6695,spk_0,these issues come to a first version
12,21.67431667,21.68416667,spk_0,soon.
13,21.68583333,21.69331667,spk_0,Uh
14,21.70883333,21.75748333,spk_0,"Remember, we might still revise the actual numbers as we go,"
15,21.75765,21.78915,spk_0,might still revise the actual things but
16,21.80198333,21.8375,spk_0,should definitely start to
17,21.84266667,21.95016667,spk_0,bring this up to a close because these are the framework on how everything else the
18,21.96431667,21.98031667,spk_0,um
19,21.98216667,21.98931667,spk_0,"for example,"
20,21.98948333,22.05933333,spk_0,"when we start discussing service side rendering or we start discussing streaming,"
21,22.05948333,22.10883333,spk_0,all of those things need to be looked at
22,22.11466667,22.15315,spk_0,in a framework of expectations and
23,22.15998333,22.20883333,spk_0,benchmarks are and budgets and we'll definitely
24,22.209,22.23566667,spk_0,need to have these already in place.
25,22.23583333,22.24315,spk_0,So
26,22.24948333,22.27933333,spk_0,"the quicker we can get a first version, the better"
27,22.30666667,22.32631667,spk_0,which
28,22.33248333,22.34833333,spk_0,brings me
29,22.37215,22.38515,spk_0,to
30,22.38931667,22.41333333,spk_0,the accessibility thing.
31,22.41516667,22.42648333,spk_0,Um
32,22.45,22.48366667,spk_0,"Paul. No, I oh, you already replied."
33,22.50781667,22.51615,spk_3,Uh
34,22.51883333,22.52898333,spk_3,yes
35,22.5315,22.56365,spk_3,to your uh fantastic list.
36,22.58098333,22.59698333,spk_3,I did.
37,22.62133333,22.64348333,spk_0,"Uh Yeah,"
38,22.686,22.69281667,spk_0,yeah.
39,22.69698333,22.70348333,spk_0,"So I,"
40,22.70365,22.77183333,spk_0,one of the things that came up in that in the accessibility for everybody to be aware
41,22.77533333,22.86431667,spk_0,is a lot of the guidelines come to the authoring of content. And in
42,22.86798333,22.87481667,spk_0,"DS,"
43,22.88216667,22.93465,spk_0,"I mean, as far as we consider authoring content"
44,22.938,23.00998333,spk_0,"is leaving comments, you can leave a comment with a little suggestion."
45,23.0125,23.07583333,spk_0,But essentially the authoring of content typically happens in the editor
46,23.076,23.1315,spk_0,"in the markdown editor or the content editor or something,"
47,23.13881667,23.17231667,spk_0,which means that we can
48,23.18566667,23.23498333,spk_0,"you can create some sort of guidelines for that tool,"
49,23.23648333,23.30581667,spk_0,but it's probably not gonna be implemented by the create teams themselves or
50,23.32648333,23.35348333,spk_0,"gosh, where is content editor?"
51,23.3715,23.43731667,spk_0,Is that plan or is that editor plan plan? So it will be
52,23.45815,23.46683333,spk_0,got it.
53,23.4715,23.50315,spk_0,So it would be coming over to the plan side.
54,23.50331667,23.57848333,spk_0,"We have to, we have to cross borders present our case, explain why this is important."
55,23.58531667,23.5905,spk_0,"And it's,"
56,23.59065,23.62583333,spk_0,it's fascinating the guidelines that Paulina presented
57,23.626,23.65115,spk_0,because a lot of the things is just
58,23.66415,23.7355,spk_0,helping the user realize that they're producing inaccessible content and
59,23.73566667,23.7945,spk_0,it's pretty much just highly focused on the editor experience.
60,23.80148333,23.85866667,spk_0,"Whereas other parts of the guidelines which I think makes more,"
61,23.85883333,23.89131667,spk_0,much more sense for our effort here.
62,23.90315,23.95548333,spk_0,Uh or at least that we can execute on is the navigation
63,23.95998333,24.02083333,spk_0,like navigating complex application with a lot of data.
64,24.02383333,24.06781667,spk_0,How can I make it easier for users with assistive technology
65,24.06798333,24.1565,spk_0,to navigate those by establishing expectations and establishing these things.
66,24.15666667,24.16733333,spk_0,Um
67,24.19216667,24.21466667,spk_0,OK. Um
68,24.22465,24.2985,spk_0,So just so I understand Paulina is the ball on your court there to produce?
69,24.30615,24.319,spk_0,Yes.
70,24.32665,24.33183333,spk_0,OK.
71,24.34081667,24.40516667,spk_0,"And then once we have that, we can probably move that over to the documentation"
72,24.4125,24.47566667,spk_0,together with the performance uh budgets that we're discussing above
73,24.48433333,24.51831667,spk_0,"and they're dependent, we can make them"
74,24.52316667,24.56683333,spk_0,committed or merge whenever they're ready. So
75,24.57783333,24.60683333,spk_0,"yeah, it's exciting. Definitely."
76,24.611,24.62031667,spk_0,Um
77,24.6385,24.64948333,spk_0,All right
78,24.66398333,24.68031667,spk_0,"with that,"
79,24.68248333,24.713,spk_0,he gets to the bottom of the agenda.
80,24.7155,24.73,spk_0,Um
81,24.75633333,24.83515,spk_0,Anybody has anything else they want to discuss uh things that might have been clear
82,24.85433333,24.86998333,spk_0,um
83,24.88416667,24.923,spk_0,that you wanna discuss or should we uh
84,24.926,24.95548333,spk_0,give some time back to people?
85,25.01533333,25.02398333,spk_5,Um
86,25.03166667,25.042,spk_5,"I,"
87,25.05866667,25.07766667,spk_5,"having worked in,"
88,25.07983333,25.09866667,spk_5,"yeah, having worked in the Diffs"
89,25.10148333,25.111,spk_5,App for
90,25.12248333,25.13166667,spk_5,um
91,25.13881667,25.16533333,spk_5,four plus years now.
92,25.173,25.275,spk_5,Um I'm not sure how complete that chart is that we added to the docs
93,25.27933333,25.32448333,spk_5,"and when I say I'm not sure. I mean, I literally don't know."
94,25.34548333,25.38633333,spk_5,It's not that I have concerns. I just don't know.
95,25.38915,25.45765,spk_5,"Um So yeah, Phil, I don't know if it, do, you know if it's like, is this everything,"
96,25.46266667,25.49748333,spk_5,#NAME?
97,25.513,25.5135,spk_6,That
98,25.51615,25.52265,spk_6,from
99,25.54148333,25.57048333,spk_6,"probably not. No,"
100,25.58465,25.64666667,spk_0,"I think we, I think we documented the the component tree, right?"
101,25.66181667,25.66283333,spk_0,But
102,25.67015,25.70716667,spk_0,#NAME?
103,25.71598333,25.75483333,spk_6,"what a normal dick would use to render,"
104,25.76916667,25.83416667,spk_6,but there's like loads of weird different views they get rendered as well
105,25.84016667,25.87481667,spk_6,that might not be documented properly.
106,25.88465,25.90748333,spk_6,And yet we haven't documented
107,25.91015,25.93016667,spk_6,the data side of things.
108,25.9945,26.01148333,spk_5,Is it worth
109,26.03298333,26.06198333,spk_5,going back through it?
110,26.11666667,26.1465,spk_5,"So, having, having converted the X"
111,26.1485,26.14915,spk_5,Cora
112,26.15266667,26.19098333,spk_5,"to this mermaid chart, like I didn't,"
113,26.20731667,26.215,spk_5,"I mean,"
114,26.23216667,26.27648333,spk_5,"it didn't have a red flag go off like, oh, I know it's missing this."
115,26.27665,26.31916667,spk_5,"And so I don't know what, what I would do."
116,26.32316667,26.34348333,spk_5,I guess it would just to step through the
117,26.34365,26.39616667,spk_5,code and just see if there's any branches missing
118,26.39915,26.42848333,spk_5,"as we go through this chart, which"
119,26.4375,26.45115,spk_5,is doable.
120,26.49,26.555,spk_6,"That's why I did at the time of create it. But that was like a year ago, a year or so. So"
121,26.57048333,26.59216667,spk_6,there's probably a lot changed since then.
122,26.63216667,26.6545,spk_5,"I mean, maybe it's just worth,"
123,26.6695,26.72065,spk_5,maybe I should just go in and edit the stock and say like
124,26.72881667,26.74466667,spk_5,this is
125,26.76031667,26.78333333,spk_5,this could be incomplete.
126,26.79481667,26.80365,spk_5,"Don't,"
127,26.82231667,26.86333333,spk_5,don't like use this as the source of truth.
128,26.87448333,26.94266667,spk_0,"So this is a really good point because we, when we talked about this,"
129,26.94281667,27.00798333,spk_0,the whole goal of document the current state is to guide us
130,27.01181667,27.03265,spk_0,uh in
131,27.046,27.10365,spk_0,identifying an ideal architecture. OK? It's not
132,27.10833333,27.12566667,spk_0,the architecture.
133,27.12983333,27.19331667,spk_0,"But for example, what we can already see like when we look at these,"
134,27.19965,27.25148333,spk_0,like there's a lot of stuff here that are um
135,27.26815,27.30115,spk_0,also applicable in the repository.
136,27.30131667,27.373,spk_0,So we can probably abstract this in a way that is generalized to all contexts.
137,27.3795,27.3945,spk_0,Uh Like
138,27.39915,27.42083333,spk_0,"when you're looking at a commit,"
139,27.43698333,27.47615,spk_0,"we're looking at at a commit in a repository,"
140,27.47631667,27.52083333,spk_0,"there will be renamed files in those commits, right?"
141,27.52415,27.53616667,spk_0,Um
142,27.55365,27.5875,spk_0,"And we're looking at comparing the branches,"
143,27.59065,27.6085,spk_0,it will be there
144,27.61231667,27.64131667,spk_0,that will be renamed too uh
145,27.67398333,27.74016667,spk_0,"bearing branches. We always also catch, yeah, I think it it would."
146,27.74498333,27.79565,spk_0,Um so we can start already starting to see that there's
147,27.79583333,27.84698333,spk_0,a bunch of things here that are common for every case of
148,27.85548333,27.89365,spk_0,the diff there's probably some areas here in this
149,27.89383333,27.94233333,spk_0,"tree that don't make sense for the repository,"
150,27.9425,27.98833333,spk_0,which we could take notes and then we can help
151,27.99731667,28.03833333,spk_0,um that can help the conversation.
152,28.04131667,28.05148333,spk_0,"In,"
153,28.06466667,28.11365,spk_0,"for example, one of the things that we've talked already is the"
154,28.12065,28.16181667,spk_0,that would be sort of part of the architecture is
155,28.176,28.18881667,spk_0,um
156,28.21766667,28.3025,spk_0,the viewers for the types of file um where we can have um
157,28.31831667,28.37398333,spk_0,"like if it's an image, if it's a text, if it's a binary, all that stuff."
158,28.38115,28.40398333,spk_0,"But more than that,"
159,28.40615,28.41598333,spk_0,that
160,28.43,28.52316667,spk_0,Eduardo rec uh suggested is to also include a way that we can have
161,28.532,28.609,spk_0,a rendered version of the diff which would benefit some cases
162,28.60916667,28.68265,spk_0,"like the uh Jupiter notebooks and potentially others uh mark down,"
163,28.68281667,28.69633333,spk_0,for example.
164,28.70381667,28.71565,spk_0,Um
165,28.73915,28.77116667,spk_0,And that's the kind of decisions we need to support
166,28.77133333,28.83681667,spk_0,here in that architecture is support different ways to render
167,28.84115,28.84915,spk_0,"sorry,"
168,28.85483333,28.88731667,spk_0,support different ways to display the D
169,28.89065,28.9085,spk_0,to the user
170,28.91483333,28.98616667,spk_0,um which will extract out of this diagram. And this um
171,29.00683333,29.02681667,spk_0,"knowledge I would say,"
172,29.09115,29.09683333,spk_0,"yeah,"
173,29.12631667,29.13383333,spk_0,go ahead.
174,29.14883333,29.16781667,spk_5,"Oh I just said, OK."
175,29.17415,29.19016667,spk_0,OK. Cool.
176,29.23465,29.25981667,spk_0,Um Cook.
177,29.30815,29.3675,spk_0,What I would also say we don't have to have everything in one diagram.
178,29.36766667,29.38783333,spk_0,If we have another way of
179,29.38966667,29.40516667,spk_0,presenting
180,29.41466667,29.46766667,spk_0,"other parts, I know that the back end did several"
181,29.46966667,29.49633333,spk_0,charts when we go
182,29.50933333,29.57448333,spk_0,the flow and then this like different ways of communicating things
183,29.58465,29.64348333,spk_0,uh especially when we're talking about different components and different parts
184,29.64715,29.67281667,spk_0,like Italy and all that stuff.
185,29.6775,29.755,spk_0,Um So we can present parts of the application and data flows differently.
186,29.75516667,29.82215,spk_0,We don't have to be restricted to one particular diagram. OK.
187,29.83065,29.85266667,spk_0,"If it makes it harder,"
188,29.86598333,29.9235,spk_0,"uh just split into multiple diagrams and we can have a different perspective,"
189,29.92366667,29.97366667,spk_0,"a different view or different lens on the data flow, for example."
190,30.00233333,30.01431667,spk_0,Cool.
191,30.02015,30.02415,spk_0,Uh
192,30.02733333,30.04833333,spk_0,So
193,30.05516667,30.06981667,spk_0,anything
194,30.09498333,30.11781667,spk_0,anything else
195,30.15283333,30.196,spk_2,I just wanted to add that we probably need a
196,30.19616667,30.26581667,spk_2,chart of all the these features that we have because
197,30.275,30.36516667,spk_2,"the structure is one thing but also inside each of the components, it might contain"
198,30.3695,30.41998333,spk_2,five different features for a particular view.
199,30.42665,30.49481667,spk_2,And like an image preview can have a commenting functionality
200,30.49948333,30.5465,spk_2,"that you can click anywhere on the image and leave a comment,"
201,30.55598333,30.59115,spk_2,uh text files have
202,30.60216667,30.65866667,spk_2,"side by side view in line view, no white space view."
203,30.66316667,30.70731667,spk_2,So stuff like that. And since we are
204,30.71165,30.7295,spk_2,moving to a new
205,30.734,30.75581667,spk_2,"des architecture,"
206,30.759,30.78383333,spk_2,we probably should
207,30.79515,30.81781667,spk_2,uh satisfy
208,30.82215,30.86381667,spk_2,this uh feature parity
209,30.876,30.90315,spk_2,uh with what we have right now.
210,30.90331667,30.95416667,spk_2,So I think it makes sense to document everything that we have.
211,30.95433333,31.02631667,spk_2,"So once we move to a new architecture, we don't miss any of the features."
212,31.09281667,31.10198333,spk_0,"All right,"
213,31.10916667,31.17065,spk_0,"you wanna start an issue with that Stanislav because I feel like that's a, a separate"
214,31.18065,31.19098333,spk_0,um
215,31.19433333,31.23531667,spk_0,effort and it's not necessarily a
216,31.23865,31.29715,spk_0,"front end thing. We might, we might involve product here as well"
217,31.30233333,31.33315,spk_0,to ensure that we um
218,31.342,31.3625,spk_0,that we're covered.
219,31.37333333,31.417,spk_0,"Of course, we can look at the code and that's definitely a way to get that."
220,31.4255,31.43366667,spk_0,But
221,31.4485,31.49331667,spk_0,what I want us to have is
222,31.50781667,31.52316667,spk_0,that definitely makes sense.
223,31.52333333,31.55016667,spk_0,"Like feature parody makes sense,"
224,31.55033333,31.60598333,spk_0,but maybe not every feature needs to be available everywhere.
225,31.61333333,31.65016667,spk_0,Uh or there could be some
226,31.655,31.6775,spk_0,tiered approach. So
227,31.68583333,31.69965,spk_0,"-- I was just gonna
-- imagine that our,"
228,31.69981667,31.79081667,spk_5,our uh our order of priorities puts future coverage actually as
229,31.79781667,31.85683333,spk_5,"-- a third on the list. So
-- by design,"
230,31.86333333,31.87698333,spk_5,"yeah, and,"
231,31.88115,31.92665,spk_5,and the um all those things you mentioned are correct.
232,31.92681667,31.98281667,spk_5,"They, they are sort of covered in that chart very abstractly like"
233,31.98898333,32.0485,spk_5,dro I think is what's handling parallel versus in line and like
234,32.04866667,32.10466667,spk_5,design pin is what's handling like being able to click anywhere.
235,32.10531667,32.16683333,spk_5,"So like they're, they're in there, it's just not like explicitly mentioned."
236,32.167,32.23231667,spk_5,So it probably is good to like list out the features that each component covers.
237,32.26381667,32.2795,spk_0,"I hate to say it,"
238,32.28281667,32.33931667,spk_0,"but it feels like this is a spreadsheet. It should be a spreadsheet or,"
239,32.34183333,32.38931667,spk_0,or a marked on table. I don't care.
240,32.39698333,32.40216667,spk_0,"But,"
241,32.41398333,32.49531667,spk_0,but essentially it looks like we need to have like an array of like features and then
242,32.50016667,32.57083333,spk_0,try to make a decision about whether they're applicable to all the contexts of des
243,32.57465,32.63016667,spk_0,"or not. Like for now, we should definitely base it off"
244,32.64481667,32.68515,spk_0,the domains we currently have.
245,32.68531667,32.72431667,spk_0,I don't know if you have any features on
246,32.72448333,32.77431667,spk_0,"the repository commit that are not an emerging quest,"
247,32.786,32.79233333,spk_0,but
248,32.80548333,32.86333333,spk_0,"maybe that's why we should go and take a look. So it feels like it's a, it's a"
249,32.87015,32.88115,spk_0,um
250,32.89331667,32.92698333,spk_0,"a feature, a feature table"
251,32.95083333,32.98248333,spk_0,for all the different contexts.
252,32.98265,33.07183333,spk_0,Uh and then just uh mark a cross or a check mark where they are available
253,33.07698333,33.11266667,spk_0,and potentially can have a discussion about whether
254,33.11283333,33.1465,spk_0,they should be available and everywhere or not.
255,33.14715,33.18648333,spk_0,"Uh And potentially, yeah, but that,"
256,33.18665,33.23915,spk_0,that feature table will be useful uh later on when we're
257,33.23931667,33.29281667,spk_0,deciding exactly about where to cut and what are the implications.
258,33.29298333,33.29915,spk_0,Because
259,33.301,33.32983333,spk_0,"for example, um"
260,33.38231667,33.40348333,spk_0,this could be controversial.
261,33.4105,33.42333333,spk_0,"I warn you,"
262,33.43648333,33.48265,spk_0,should we leave comments on a repository commit?
263,33.52383333,33.58265,spk_0,"That's a product decision. It's not a technical decision, it's a product decision."
264,33.58281667,33.59266667,spk_0,And
265,33.59866667,33.61198333,spk_0,"to be honest,"
266,33.6335,33.69515,spk_0,"there is arguments, I'm just saying there are arguments."
267,33.69748333,33.70981667,spk_0,Uh
268,33.71581667,33.73515,spk_0,Maybe I agree with them
269,33.7385,33.75981667,spk_0,that um
270,33.76398333,33.79,spk_0,"if you leave a comedy in a commit,"
271,33.79616667,33.86516667,spk_0,"there's nobody looking at that commit, maybe the author will get a notification,"
272,33.873,33.88383333,spk_0,I guess.
273,33.89915,33.94131667,spk_0,But in emerging request is the moment that everybody is looking at that
274,33.94148333,33.98898333,spk_0,code or at least people are looking at that code to be reviewed.
275,33.98915,34.07198333,spk_0,"But when it's a repository, it's at, it's at rest. It's a, it's a it's a code at rest."
276,34.07881667,34.09416667,spk_0,"So,"
277,34.09833333,34.135,spk_0,should we allow discussions to happen there?
278,34.14766667,34.18165,spk_0,That's a more of a product UX decision.
279,34.1835,34.25398333,spk_0,And I think that table will help us make those conversations easier. So
280,34.27633333,34.29848333,spk_0,ST has left an open an issue for that
281,34.30298333,34.32065,spk_0,and get the ball rolling.
282,34.33563333,34.35015,spk_0,"I already did it,"
283,34.35565,34.37763333,spk_2,linking it right now in South.
284,34.41048333,34.4335,spk_0,Amazing. Amazing.
285,34.43581667,34.44798333,spk_0,Thank you.
286,34.45116667,34.46033333,spk_0,Awesome.
287,34.46596667,34.51266667,spk_0,I'll also take Kai on that to help us out. Uh
288,34.52415,34.60781667,spk_0,"And uh and then we can make um there so Jacques from, from source code side,"
289,34.60796667,34.64316667,spk_0,it would be great for us to um
290,34.65313333,34.74266667,spk_0,pull in. Also if you uh wanna uh discover the product a little bit going on a journey
291,34.75796667,34.81946667,spk_0,"to also add the source code perspective on these because again,"
292,34.8225,34.87666667,spk_0,there might be features in source code that we would like to have
293,34.88263333,34.9345,spk_0,on the merger quest. I can't remember anything but
294,34.93698333,34.95566667,spk_0,maybe I'm missing something.
295,34.96716667,34.97616667,spk_0,Um
296,34.98998333,35.03766667,spk_0,"So yeah, basically what I'm saying is let's crowdsource that issue"
297,35.04481667,35.12448333,spk_0,"uh and uh whatever way of doing it, the table a spreadsheet or, or something, just"
298,35.12916667,35.17083333,spk_0,let's all collaborating and making that evolve. OK.
299,35.2175,35.23615,spk_0,Sweet.
300,35.24815,35.27516667,spk_0,Thanks. Standard Life. That's useful.
301,35.301,35.30466667,spk_0,Mm
302,35.33483333,35.34498333,spk_0,What else
303,35.35698333,35.36733333,spk_0,are we good
304,35.38315,35.39148333,spk_0,for now?
305,35.49148333,35.49783333,spk_0,"All right,"
306,35.49798333,35.52715,spk_0,we can use the rest of the time to go into
307,35.52731667,35.5935,spk_0,the issues and uh share our thoughts and make those discussions.
308,35.59366667,35.60183333,spk_0,Go ahead.
309,35.61215,35.63581667,spk_0,Uh Thanks everybody
310,35.64216667,35.7125,spk_0,and uh thanks for your time and I'll see you around and in another call perhaps
