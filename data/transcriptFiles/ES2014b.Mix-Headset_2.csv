,start_time,end_time,speaker_label,text
0,21.00131667,21.04,spk_3,"we could maybe come up with a menu, a sort of a,"
1,21.04216667,21.08016667,spk_3,an L CD menu for other functions
2,21.09098333,21.13248333,spk_3,on the remote control that's worth thinking about.
3,21.13915,21.15933333,spk_3,Um And
4,21.16516667,21.21066667,spk_3,maybe we could think about speech recognition as well because
5,21.21581667,21.22465,spk_3,um
6,21.23681667,21.25381667,spk_3,so young people are
7,21.2695,21.33248333,spk_3,"perhaps the ones that a re gonna buy, buy our new product if we aim a tat sort of,"
8,21.3335,21.36381667,spk_3,"you know, sort of a high tech design"
9,21.38515,21.42681667,spk_3,"that, that might be the market that we're, we're looking for."
10,21.45198333,21.50348333,spk_3,And we could maybe think about using speech recognition recognition as
11,21.50365,21.54633333,spk_3,a way to find remote control if it's lost in a room
12,21.55798333,21.58531667,spk_3,rather than sort of um
13,21.59098333,21.60198333,spk_3,having it
14,21.61615,21.6465,spk_3,speech recognition to change the channels.
15,21.659,21.69931667,spk_3,Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise
16,21.69948333,21.75381667,spk_3,so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channels.
17,21.77198333,21.79183333,spk_3,Okay. Um
18,21.79383333,21.81716667,spk_3,And that's the end of the slide show.
19,21.82065,21.82898333,spk_3,That's it
20,21.83248333,21.84081667,spk_3,cool.
21,21.85748333,21.88016667,spk_0,And was that last wee bit there
22,21.89,21.89981667,spk_0,um
23,21.90965,21.93366667,spk_0,about speech recognition?
24,21.93966667,21.95066667,spk_0,Okay. But
25,21.95266667,22.0135,spk_0,#NAME?
26,22.01615,22.06266667,spk_3,"yeah, they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control,"
27,22.06283333,22.08498333,spk_3,which offered that possibility.
28,22.08515,22.14515,spk_3,"And as you go up through the age groups, people who got less and less interested"
29,22.15016667,22.18048333,spk_3,"in sort of a, a remote control that you can"
30,22.18315,22.1965,spk_3,"talk to. So,"
31,22.22431667,22.22481667,spk_1,um
32,22.24765,22.27665,spk_1,it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and
33,22.27681667,22.33016667,spk_1,they might end up costing more than a 1250 budget for
34,22.34315,22.34383333,spk_1,speech
35,22.35483333,22.35981667,spk_1,recognition.
36,22.37966667,22.38265,spk_1,Um
37,22.4005,22.45615,spk_1,"And possibly the thing about the by the remote being lost, we could have,"
38,22.46266667,22.49481667,spk_1,"you know, with your mobile phone, you lose that, you can ring it."
39,22.49498333,22.53681667,spk_1,Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can
40,22.54115,22.56815,spk_1,just kind of buzzer system between the two.
41,22.56831667,22.6175,spk_1,"Yeah, so you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it uh"
42,22.62015,22.62281667,spk_1,huh.
43,22.6255,22.64081667,spk_1,Maybe it buzzes to
44,22.646,22.68216667,spk_1,"Yeah, somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is."
45,22.68566667,22.74416667,spk_1,"Yeah, we'd have that, that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well,"
46,22.74433333,22.74816667,spk_3,"which,"
47,22.75381667,22.81615,spk_3,"-- which again would probably be a bit expensive but there's
-- key rings"
48,22.81631667,22.85233333,spk_2,um that you kind of whistle a T or clap a T.
49,22.85998333,22.86483333,spk_2,Yeah.
50,22.86666667,22.896,spk_2,"And then the whistle back or something like that,"
51,22.921,22.93098333,spk_2,they're cheap.
52,22.93366667,22.93433333,spk_2,Mmhm
53,23.009,23.01015,spk_1,The
54,23.01266667,23.01466667,spk_1,sa me
55,23.02431667,23.0275,spk_1,technology
56,23.03,23.051,spk_1,"could be put inside the,"
57,23.06015,23.06683333,spk_0,"well, if"
58,23.07448333,23.10965,spk_0,you're trying to avoid having a second product cause
59,23.10981667,23.13715,spk_0,obviously you could have a second product that gave
60,23.13731667,23.19616667,spk_0,"you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing,"
61,23.205,23.21966667,spk_0,"you know, without"
62,23.22848333,23.25233333,spk_0,sound recognition. But
63,23.2565,23.27231667,spk_0,"if you,"
64,23.303,23.32566667,spk_0,I know um
65,23.33,23.35148333,spk_0,"I was gonna say a sharp noise,"
66,23.36415,23.38931667,spk_0,clapping of hand or whatever
67,23.43531667,23.48183333,spk_0,you'd want to try and just have the one product that
68,23.484,23.4965,spk_0,"if,"
69,23.53715,23.60348333,spk_1,"yeah, if you, if we could have it in the actual remote, everything in 11."
70,23.62083333,23.65315,spk_0,Um I dunno um
71,23.66733333,23.72316667,spk_0,"talking about vo I mean, obviously if you've got voice recognition,"
72,23.72333333,23.73915,spk_0,then you can do it
73,23.7545,23.81066667,spk_0,"in that way because it will recognise the voice and you can give it a command,"
74,23.81083333,23.84583333,spk_0,"a set command, whatever that happened to be."
75,23.85833333,23.87766667,spk_0,But you've then got the point.
76,23.87783333,23.93166667,spk_0,"If you, if you're not going with the voice recognition, then"
77,23.99548333,24.00398333,spk_1,"perhaps,"
78,24.01015,24.02116667,spk_1,"um,"
79,24.03833333,24.06415,spk_1,"so that would solve the problems with the TV,"
80,24.06431667,24.09331667,spk_1,kinda speaking to the remote and changing itself.
81,24.11998333,24.13865,spk_0,"So, uh"
82,24.17065,24.19098333,spk_0,"any su suggest, well,"
83,24.19383333,24.23833333,spk_0,"-- any conclusions,
-- um would it take"
84,24.24148333,24.27615,spk_3,quite a while to sort of develop this
85,24.27631667,24.32733333,spk_3,speech recognition software in the remote control?
86,24.33715,24.36998333,spk_0,"So if it does, then we can't,"
87,24.37415,24.43031667,spk_0,"it's that simple because we've got uh the, the three"
88,24.44348333,24.49166667,spk_0,primary um uh requisites
89,24.50115,24.51883333,spk_0,from uh
90,24.54016667,24.57983333,spk_0,"from an email, ah, that was sent to me"
91,24.59616667,24.6585,spk_0,whereby we had the design logo was one which we've already mentioned.
92,24.66533333,24.6885,spk_0,"We've got um,"
93,24.69548333,24.73566667,spk_0,"the remote was only for the television and not for,"
94,24.73583333,24.78681667,spk_0,because that would make it too complex and we have to get a market quickly.
95,24.79315,24.86215,spk_0,"And the uh third thing was that, um teletext,"
96,24.86466667,24.94715,spk_0,"uh as far as uh the management is concerned, um, has become outdated"
97,24.95181667,24.98648333,spk_0,uh due to the popularity of the internet.
98,24.99981667,25.01083333,spk_0,So
99,25.0135,25.08881667,spk_0,that means that uh so these a re the sort of three
100,25.1045,25.16116667,spk_0,extra para meters that have been put on this uh project.
101,25.1775,25.1855,spk_0,So
102,25.19065,25.22015,spk_0,we're being focused effectively
103,25.238,25.2655,spk_0,directly A T A television.
104,25.267,25.34281667,spk_0,And it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path
105,25.35433333,25.37133333,spk_0,and not
106,25.373,25.41066667,spk_0,opening out. So anything that uh
107,25.41848333,25.47665,spk_0,"is to be added such as voice recognition, et cetera"
108,25.48816667,25.55198333,spk_0,has to be very simple and has to be very quick
109,25.559,25.59131667,spk_0,"because time to market is,"
110,25.60131667,25.61533333,spk_0,is critical.
111,25.64131667,25.6835,spk_1,"If we could get something in which was quite quick and simple,"
112,25.68366667,25.71598333,spk_1,"that would give us an advantage of o other remotes,"
113,25.74416667,25.81981667,spk_0,but probably quick and simple is primary rather than
114,25.84281667,25.8905,spk_0,"added extras, added extras would be nice. But"
115,25.89833333,25.93498333,spk_0,the primary consideration is to get the project
116,25.93515,25.98966667,spk_0,"finished within uh a s short time window,"
117,25.98983333,26.0,spk_0,which effectively
118,26.00598333,26.01448333,spk_0,now is
119,26.02648333,26.05348333,spk_0,"sort of four hours. So,"
120,26.07698333,26.15148333,spk_0,"and if, and we gotta get to the end, I th I think, I think first and foremost,"
121,26.15165,26.21733333,spk_0,"we gotta get to the end, then get to the end with some added extras if possible."
122,26.24666667,26.26716667,spk_0,Okay. Uh
123,26.27231667,26.29548333,spk_0,My screen just
124,26.325,26.353,spk_0,"bunker me, right? Okay."
125,26.36148333,26.3925,spk_0,"Uh So I need to,"
126,26.44915,26.45798333,spk_0,right.
127,26.46116667,26.469,spk_0,So
128,26.47533333,26.52083333,spk_0,"I don't know how long we have left of uh time,"
129,26.546,26.57383333,spk_0,but we have to make the decisions
130,26.57716667,26.59531667,spk_0,on uh
131,26.6175,26.64115,spk_0,the remote control functions
132,26.66798333,26.74033333,spk_0,and how we're planning to proceed so that A T the next uh
133,26.74348333,26.751,spk_0,meeting
134,26.78298333,26.89033333,spk_0,"each person that's got AAA task to do is clear from this meeting, what that task is."
135,26.92831667,26.99233333,spk_0,We'll also know when the next meeting is. I. Um
136,27.00798333,27.051,spk_0,So we'll know how long we've got to complete that task
137,27.05683333,27.1,spk_0,"and then we can report back A T the next meeting and say, right, okay."
138,27.10016667,27.13115,spk_0,"Yes, we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this."
139,27.13133333,27.16398333,spk_0,This is how far we've progressed.
140,27.17031667,27.19866667,spk_0,Does that make
141,27.20283333,27.22398333,spk_0,reasonable sense?
142,27.251,27.25998333,spk_0,So
143,27.28333333,27.29965,spk_0,we have to come
144,27.30516667,27.34931667,spk_0,effectively to the decision on the remote functions so
145,27.34948333,27.38298333,spk_0,that you can decide what you're gonna be doing?
146,27.39683333,27.45131667,spk_0,"And if due between the time of this meeting,"
147,27.45148333,27.48566667,spk_0,"finishing and the next meeting starting,"
148,27.48583333,27.54065,spk_0,if you get any additional information that uh
149,27.55633333,27.59016667,spk_0,"only you have at that point in time,"
150,27.60115,27.63648333,spk_0,you think would be relevant to other people in
151,27.63665,27.68366667,spk_0,"terms of their de decision making um process,"
152,27.68383333,27.7385,spk_0,then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not
153,27.74148333,27.78448333,spk_0,"wait until the next meeting, do it via"
154,27.78783333,27.80283333,spk_0,the email.
155,27.811,27.8485,spk_0,"So that rather than coming, you know,"
156,27.85483333,27.90083333,spk_0,"if you get the information just before the next meeting, that's fine."
157,27.901,27.93915,spk_0,"Come along with the next meeting, we can discuss it then and"
158,27.94233333,28.00148333,spk_0,"take whatever actions appropriate. But if you get it well, before the next meeting,"
159,28.00516667,28.07083333,spk_0,let everybody else know cause that might have an impact on their uh
160,28.10416667,28.13731667,spk_0,what they come up with effectively
161,28.14166667,28.17265,spk_0,A t the next meeting. Okay.
162,28.19948333,28.21598333,spk_0,"All right. Is there,"
163,28.23115,28.26766667,spk_3,"so do we need to decide on the functions? Now,"
164,28.28081667,28.30033333,spk_0,I would
165,28.30483333,28.32048333,spk_0,guess so.
166,28.33698333,28.34065,spk_2,"Well,"
167,28.34081667,28.37198333,spk_2,I think it would be really easy and it would be
168,28.37215,28.409,spk_2,"a big advantage if we did have some sort of,"
169,28.40916667,28.41466667,spk_2,"um,"
170,28.42383333,28.46798333,spk_2,kind of whistle back kind of function
171,28.4795,28.52465,spk_2,"-- cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing
-- it."
172,28.53031667,28.58531667,spk_3,"And that was, that was the number one sort of frustration that people said. So"
173,28.60283333,28.6485,spk_3,I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that. So
174,28.68133333,28.72766667,spk_2,I don't really know about the voice recognition thing.
175,28.75765,28.76031667,spk_0,W
176,28.76565,28.79148333,spk_0,"well, uh maybe"
177,28.80416667,28.826,spk_1,we should concentrate just on the
178,28.82766667,28.82916667,spk_1,whistle.
179,28.83898333,28.85581667,spk_0,Something simple.
180,28.85833333,28.91598333,spk_0,"If our primary consideration is to get it there in time,"
181,28.91966667,28.93566667,spk_0,"time short,"
182,28.94216667,28.99715,spk_0,you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer
183,29.00466667,29.02083333,spk_0,so that we can
184,29.02648333,29.05216667,spk_0,have it as a selling point for the product.
185,29.0655,29.10198333,spk_0,Something that's quick and simple.
186,29.11316667,29.12465,spk_2,"So, and that"
187,29.13,29.18031667,spk_2,cut off the kind of older generation either cause everyone can whistle a
188,29.18048333,29.23115,spk_2,clap and they wouldn't have to be kinda scared of this new technology.
189,29.23681667,29.284,spk_0,"So maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be a,"
190,29.29731667,29.33583333,spk_0,on the basis that
191,29.33983333,29.39515,spk_0,"if we've got, if we're catering to the whole age range,"
192,29.40033333,29.4525,spk_0,"you want something that's easy to do now, something that like"
193,29.45683333,29.459,spk_0,wh uh
194,29.46431667,29.48915,spk_0,"Well, II, I don't know."
195,29.48931667,29.53931667,spk_0,"Well, if you think that more people can whistle than clap, then that's fine,"
196,29.53948333,29.55531667,spk_0,then go for that option.
197,29.55548333,29.62848333,spk_0,But if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle. So uh
198,29.63248333,29.65115,spk_0,so clap option.
199,29.66431667,29.66916667,spk_0,Yeah.
200,29.8275,29.8885,spk_2,"Okay. Okay. We've already decided that we don't need a Teletext button, haven't we?"
201,29.90148333,29.91533333,spk_0,"Uh, eff"
202,29.92133333,29.93731667,spk_0,effectively.
203,29.9375,29.97583333,spk_0,"That's what the, that's what they're saying that, uh, if,"
204,29.976,30.02015,spk_0,if people a re now using the internet then you don't need teletext.
205,30.02031667,30.02415,spk_0,"So, so"
206,30.04148333,30.06516667,spk_0,"take out Teletext,"
207,30.07583333,30.14633333,spk_1,"do we decide on having the 10, um, the 10 numbers"
208,30.14866667,30.16215,spk_1,and then the
209,30.18833333,30.22481667,spk_1,"next to it, which can enabled you to put them together?"
210,30.22648333,30.26148333,spk_3,"Well, I think nowadays you can just get ones where"
211,30.26333333,30.31883333,spk_3,it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number
212,30.32516667,30.34883333,spk_3,so you can press any two
213,30.35581667,30.38448333,spk_3,and it will sort of put them together.
214,30.3885,30.43948333,spk_3,"-- Okay.
-- 10 numbers and then some kind of device to allow. Uh,"
215,30.44548333,30.45131667,spk_1,"yeah,"
216,30.46398333,30.48448333,spk_1,I put delay to a lab.
217,30.496,30.50283333,spk_1,"Yeah,"
218,30.50948333,30.52481667,spk_1,multiple numbers
219,30.54683333,30.55565,spk_1,or multiple
220,30.55765,30.56466667,spk_1,teachers.
221,30.571,30.57631667,spk_1,Yeah.
222,30.62831667,30.64915,spk_1,Did we decide anything about
223,30.67398333,30.71631667,spk_1,the other functions as in setting the
224,30.71865,30.73616667,spk_1,audio and
225,30.74416667,30.803,spk_1,"s tuning it and stuff like that? You had an, an idea about the menu."
226,30.81165,30.85,spk_3,Uh We could possibly put an L A sort of
227,30.85531667,30.90765,spk_3,uh L CD menu in. But that again is probably
228,30.91031667,30.92631667,spk_3,"an expense that,"
229,30.93731667,30.97398333,spk_1,"but just thinking, um, people probably, I mean,"
230,30.97415,31.00348333,spk_1,"you don't ha you only have to probably tune the TV,"
231,31.00365,31.04,spk_1,once but you have to be able to tune it that once.
232,31.0465,31.10365,spk_1,"So, and the, and the TV breaks to get a new one, you're gonna have to be able to tune it."
233,31.10565,31.12415,spk_1,You can't really avoid that
234,31.13048333,31.175,spk_1,except the new digital market. We should do it by themselves.
235,31.196,31.27783333,spk_1,"-- But th
-- but that's relying on the television market changing"
236,31.278,31.31848333,spk_0,"to an automatic and if it is a t,"
237,31.31865,31.365,spk_0,"the moment, that's fine, but a t the moment it's not."
238,31.36516667,31.39466667,spk_0,So it seems to me that you have to have
239,31.39481667,31.43983333,spk_0,"a device that caters cause otherwise it would make it,"
240,31.45266667,31.48833333,spk_0,uh your device would become
241,31.49115,31.52966667,spk_0,inoperable or only operable in certain
242,31.53231667,31.5565,spk_0,circumstances. And
243,31.56181667,31.60266667,spk_0,"the idea is to have an international market which is,"
244,31.62183333,31.69498333,spk_0,"and it's also, it's the, the product we've got is something that's a t the,"
245,31.69515,31.74683333,spk_0,I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale.
246,31.74698333,31.79216667,spk_0,So we're not really going for something that's uh
247,31.8085,31.832,spk_0,I si suppose high
248,31.83783333,31.84183333,spk_0,"tech,"
249,31.85315,31.87481667,spk_0,"if people a re buying remotes,"
250,31.875,31.9235,spk_3,"then they're probably buying it to replace another remote,"
251,31.92966667,31.97265,spk_3,possibly most tellies come with remotes. So
252,31.97881667,31.98016667,spk_3,"I mean,"
253,31.98031667,32.04233333,spk_3,we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions.
254,32.0425,32.05083333,spk_3,So
255,32.0585,32.10581667,spk_3,"we maybe need to keep the, the tuning function in."
256,32.10933333,32.14281667,spk_1,Yeah. Okay. So how would this menu function work?
257,32.14298333,32.201,spk_1,"Would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons,"
258,32.20115,32.24765,spk_1,maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions?
259,32.24931667,32.27431667,spk_1,#NAME?
260,32.30581667,32.36181667,spk_2,"Yeah, cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well."
261,32.36316667,32.409,spk_2,My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark.
262,32.40916667,32.45398333,spk_2,So I had to go through it and turn the brightness up.
263,32.45666667,32.48,spk_2,"So you just think we're gonna have the,"
264,32.48016667,32.55283333,spk_1,the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more
265,32.55765,32.61283333,spk_1,"advanced, um, instruction booklets come with it to guide."
266,32.613,32.63881667,spk_1,"Cause you, uh I think it'd be quite hard"
267,32.651,32.68315,spk_1,"just for people to grasp, um,"
268,32.68665,32.72198333,spk_1,"just off like the menu but that you don't use different buttons,"
269,32.72215,32.73931667,spk_1,maybe have to have like
270,32.74433333,32.76333333,spk_1,some better instructions
271,32.76716667,32.78298333,spk_1,of how that actually work.
272,32.78766667,32.81533333,spk_3,I'm not sure whether sort of having
273,32.82248333,32.85731667,spk_3,"people have a booklet cause one,"
274,32.85748333,32.91466667,spk_3,the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one.
275,32.92415,32.942,spk_3,So maybe
276,32.94683333,32.97681667,spk_3,"next to each of the buttons, you know,"
277,32.97698333,33.03665,spk_3,each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it.
278,33.04065,33.057,spk_3,So you're basically
279,33.05916667,33.07183333,spk_3,pressing.
280,33.07898333,33.11133333,spk_1,But that also goes back to the original design
281,33.11148333,33.13498333,spk_1,when we saw those two and there was the one
282,33.13515,33.15866667,spk_1,on the left hand side which had all like the
283,33.15883333,33.20148333,spk_1,double functions and stuff which kinda looked too busy and
284,33.209,33.228,spk_1,"had too much on it. So,"
285,33.24515,33.24898333,spk_1,okay.
286,33.29666667,33.29883333,spk_2,"Well,"
287,33.32583333,33.32783333,spk_2,kind of
288,33.33248333,33.34148333,spk_2,the bottom bit
289,33.34481667,33.35381667,spk_2,down.
290,33.42516667,33.43731667,spk_0,That's a very good
291,33.44183333,33.4425,spk_1,idea.
292,33.50216667,33.5355,spk_1,#NAME?
293,33.538,33.59216667,spk_0,"right, we've got five minutes before we wind up those meetings."
294,33.59233333,33.63566667,spk_0,"So I've been told, I don't know if you've got the sa me."
295,33.65365,33.66116667,spk_0,Okay.
296,33.66865,33.67698333,spk_0,"So,"
297,33.6795,33.7025,spk_0,so keep um
298,33.73231667,33.75365,spk_0,keep detailed
299,33.773,33.79016667,spk_0,functions
300,33.80833333,33.81933333,spk_0,um
301,33.836,33.86148333,spk_0,hidden A T the back.
302,33.86815,33.87566667,spk_2,Hm.
303,33.878,33.92015,spk_2,"And that would be better for the older generation as well cause,"
304,33.93281667,33.96031667,spk_2,"well, my dad doesn't like"
305,33.96666667,33.992,spk_2,that. You've gotta kind of flick through a menu
306,34.00033333,34.02533333,spk_2,but he can pretty much read a button.
307,34.03816667,34.04016667,spk_2,"So,"
308,34.04531667,34.0605,spk_2,display it properly.
309,34.09515,34.15183333,spk_1,We're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as well.
310,34.1595,34.18366667,spk_1,"So, we're gonna have like two separate,"
311,34.18833333,34.20696667,spk_1,two separate lists. I guess
312,34.23333333,34.29831667,spk_0,your data functions hidden A T back can bring out when needed.
313,34.30916667,34.3375,spk_3,The detailed ones will be sort of
314,34.35466667,34.37031667,spk_3,brightness.
315,34.3975,34.40833333,spk_0,"Oh, that's right."
316,34.4085,34.42315,spk_0,"So, we're just,"
317,34.42331667,34.45516667,spk_0,so you've got which ones a re gonna be on the front
318,34.45533333,34.47916667,spk_0,and which ones a re gonna be a in the back?
319,34.48916667,34.50583333,spk_0,We have to decide
320,34.52331667,34.52415,spk_1,next
321,34.5295,34.53215,spk_1,couple of
322,34.534,34.53533333,spk_1,minutes
323,34.53731667,34.54081667,spk_1,and then
324,34.54333333,34.5435,spk_1,I
325,34.5538,34.56465,spk_1,guess so.
326,34.57746667,34.59248333,spk_1,"So on the,"
327,34.6073,34.61831667,spk_0,so
328,34.62565,34.64281667,spk_0,on front.
329,34.66963333,34.67013333,spk_0,Yes.
330,34.68613333,34.69698333,spk_0,Numbers
331,34.73883333,34.73933333,spk_2,and
332,34.74183333,34.74915,spk_2,the volume
333,34.7685,34.77666667,spk_1,volume.
334,34.79415,34.81998333,spk_1,"If you have a mute button as well,"
335,34.83598333,34.85398333,spk_1,a mute button as well.
336,34.87046667,34.87831667,spk_1,Hm.
337,34.89183333,34.9028,spk_1,Oh.
338,34.91165,34.91783333,spk_2,Mm-hmm.
339,34.92166667,34.9505,spk_3,And it's probably a power one as well.
340,34.96816667,34.97431667,spk_3,I know.
341,35.04548333,35.06648333,spk_2,"I know. It's probably like, um,"
342,35.09333333,35.11948333,spk_2,not an issue to raise. Yeah.
343,35.12315,35.16766667,spk_2,"But, um, the whole thing about not using a stand by,"
344,35.17331667,35.197,spk_2,"uh, because of the,"
345,35.20365,35.24233333,spk_2,like waste of electricity on that. Have you seen the adverts?
346,35.24831667,35.28016667,spk_2,Like if you boil the kettle that's full. It's a weird
347,35.28298333,35.331,spk_2,leave your telly on standby. It powers black people for a certain a mount of time.
348,35.34381667,35.38281667,spk_2,"-- We should maybe try to discourage people from stand
-- by,"
349,35.38598333,35.414,spk_1,but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one.
350,35.49898333,35.5395,spk_0,"So, so a re you having the stand by on the front then"
351,35.55765,35.55781667,spk_1,a
352,35.57083333,35.58466667,spk_2,little bit smaller.
353,35.62815,35.639,spk_0,"Well,"
354,35.65648333,35.697,spk_1,a re we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons.
355,35.7045,35.717,spk_3,Um
356,35.72031667,35.72731667,spk_3,cause
357,35.73281667,35.7625,spk_3,"yeah, the market research said there was"
358,35.76515,35.80483333,spk_3,quite a lot of people do just zap around
359,35.80933333,35.821,spk_3,"-- flick.
-- So,"
360,35.87365,35.89233333,spk_1,so we've got 1000
361,35.91716667,35.93033333,spk_1,and 60
362,35.96131667,35.996,spk_0,channel I'm doing. What else have we got?
363,35.99881667,36.02566667,spk_0,#NAME?
364,36.02748333,36.03215,spk_3,volume
365,36.03533333,36.0385,spk_3,is
366,36.06866667,36.07481667,spk_0,so
367,36.08598333,36.118,spk_0,volume button. How many volumes?
368,36.13083333,36.13131667,spk_3,One?
369,36.15133333,36.16316667,spk_0,Okay
370,36.1925,36.2,spk_2,on me
371,36.217,36.26465,spk_3,"and am. Yeah, that's 16, isn't it? Yeah. So anything else?"
372,36.31048333,36.32683333,spk_3,I don't think so. No
373,36.338,36.3425,spk_0,Parbo
374,36.34831667,36.36165,spk_0,and stand by
375,36.37415,36.397,spk_0,channel up and down.
376,36.40883333,36.42516667,spk_0,"So, is that it"
377,36.44565,36.45715,spk_0,okay?
378,36.46198333,36.49166667,spk_0,That's 16 buttons. You reckon
379,36.49915,36.52048333,spk_0,and then A t the back
380,36.54783333,36.55583333,spk_3,you've got
381,36.57266667,36.6015,spk_3,brightness and contrast.
382,36.63698333,36.65966667,spk_1,"Maybe if we're gonna run out of time,"
383,36.65983333,36.72031667,spk_1,one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back a t the next meeting.
384,36.72048333,36.73433333,spk_1,Just a t the start and
385,36.74616667,36.75248333,spk_0,see. Ok.
386,36.76148333,36.77798333,spk_0,So on the back
387,36.79815,36.82865,spk_0,it'll have brightness contrast.
388,36.84148333,36.8545,spk_0,Anything else
389,36.8685,36.9,spk_0,you're also gonna have the channel tuna in
390,36.90183333,36.92015,spk_0,or as it were
391,36.99333333,37.02266667,spk_0,"tuner, would that have up and down?"
392,37.06981667,37.08315,spk_1,Okay. Yeah.
393,37.11165,37.11931667,spk_3,Ok.
394,37.14515,37.17616667,spk_3,And then maybe sort of an enter button for
395,37.2085,37.27283333,spk_3,"sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular"
396,37.27815,37.29481667,spk_3,thing tuned in
397,37.30248333,37.32398333,spk_3,so you go up and down and then it
398,37.3375,37.33916667,spk_3,finds
399,37.34366667,37.35166667,spk_3,it and then you wanna
