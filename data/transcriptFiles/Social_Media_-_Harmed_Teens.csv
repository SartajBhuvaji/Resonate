 the time."

 down."
22,3.639483333333333,3.832983333333333,spk_4,"But um if I went on Tik Tok and I kind of just analyzed everyone and just was like trying to compare myself, then it would definitely bring me down. But just as a content creator, I just have the mindset of like, oh, this is what you make and maybe I can make it differently"
23,3.919333333333333,4.411816666666667,spk_5,"prior to a movement. I started called log off. I spent about five hours on social media day and it was to talk with my sister who was in college, but I also got really bad um repercussions about my body and I felt really terrible after scrolling. But you know, after I rethought about how I wanted to spend my time on there, it became much more productive. So I still spend time on like Instagram. Its just to like, get a meme from my college sister or to like, talk with friends that really bring me up.  I
 have an Instagram, I have a tiktok but like, I never open the app. Like,"
24,4.413583333333333,4.909916666666667,spk_2,"ever, Im clearly not the skinniest and like I have alopecia. So Im losing my hair and like, Ill look on social media and like, Ill see some like K pop star and theyre like a double zero with the longest hair on the planet and theyre like s like their skin is silk smooth. And when I take pictures, no matter what I do, you can see the whites of my scalp. So I dont take photos and because I dont take photos, I dont have anything to post and because I dont have anything to post, I dont see a point in opening the app. Plus Id rather spend my time reading."
25,4.9355,5.16,spk_1,"I used to be more um meek and mild. I was just like, oh no, theyre gonna call me, Im ugly and theyre gonna hate on me. But then um when tiktok started blowing up, one of my videos blew up and I was just like, hey, they dont hate me and I was just like, oh OK, the confidence its coming in"
26,5.1654833333333325,5.750483333333333,spk_5,"and I get 100 notifications a day from my best friend saying I found this new video you would love and Ill click on it occasionally and I love the video because its funny, its short and it like matches my personality, but it makes me really upset when like I facetime with my friend and shes scrolling through Tik Tok. Its really scary to see my friends kind of disconnect with me and just connect with these people theyve never met.  What do you think is the
 misconception pro social media people that were narcs and that we kind of hate social media. Like parents hate social media. I dont think they really know our stories and know why exactly we dont want to exist on the platforms in the way that they are."
27,5.750666666666667,5.90715,spk_3,"Ive had hurtful things posted about me and the thing about the internet, its, its there forever and its not like a word that was just said to me on the playground. Its something thats out there and other people can see"

29,6.1013166666666665,6.380483333333333,spk_5,"There can be communities found within social media, but my personal experience with it and from a lot of stories that Ive heard through log off is that a lot of kids have lost people because of social media. And I think that that constant mindless scrolling allows you to kind of go into this bubble and just hunker down and to not really talk with people."
30,6.38065,6.7019166666666665,spk_2,"I know a bunch of kids that like, dont know how to communicate outside of like an emoji or like outside of like a picture or like, only have a one picture face and like, we repeatedly take the same, like, well stop everyone in the friend group to pick a wall and just sit there and pose and take 100 photos and stand there and wait, theyre like, no, no, Ill take one more.  I
 definitely like would base like entire friend groups to"
31,6.7021,6.988866666666667,spk_3,"hang out and just take pictures like we wouldnt communicate. It would just be pictures just to post on Instagram. And then I would find myself that like we didnt even connect when we were hanging out. It was wasnt quality time because I feel like, oh, I have to get that perfect photo of all of that. All of us looking like were having fun even if were not,  I just need to get that so I can
 post it after a while."
32,6.989033333333333,7.1973666666666665,spk_1,You feel the pressure and everything. People start being people and theyre just empty profile pictures. People will come to me and they wont know my name. Theyll go by my screen name and then Im just like uh am I human?
33,7.228833333333333,7.630983333333333,spk_0,"I like to ask questions and comments and ask like, oh, where did you get that or you know like what hair dye did you use or something like that? Because I think its a lot more engaging or I like to sometimes Ill make my like my post, Ill make it a question. Like the the the caption, I like to interact with like a lot of my followers through comments because Im uncomfortable, you know, messaging them personally.  Its good to like interact with the people that support
 you."
34,7.631150000000001,7.7414,spk_5,"But what would you say to like bigger influence like Kylie Jenner, like Kim Kardash  that cant have that interaction via the comments
 and then Alex,"
35,7.74155,7.813733333333333,spk_1,"some people just dont even reply to you.  Those just double tap, like the message going
 off."
36,7.8139,8.376966666666666,spk_4,"What you said about like making real human connection. Have you ever like looked into like social media accounts to like promote that because I dont know if you guys know were not really strangers. If you guys know them, they have a card game, you dont know. OK, so its ba basically a card game where you have perception analysis and then reflection and then you just have conversations like or how are you really or you know, if how is like, whats, what do you, what do you, what would you name the chapter of this in your life? And then boom, were in a 20 minute conversation that like she feels really low and shes trying to change. And the, and you know, and I would have never thought that if this social media account didnt push me or didnt encourage me to have deeper conversations."
37,8.377966666666667,8.6342,spk_5,"I agree. But I think the issue is with the algorithm in place like thats not popping up on my feed. Like Im not, I dont know that those exist and because its so expansive and because theres so much hollowness and mindless scrolling, like, Ive never found that if I found that I would have loved that  with the
 algorithm and the fact that you never see those things,"
38,8.634366666666667,8.855033333333333,spk_4,"like I always feel like were on a whole different side of tiktok than you are and all it takes is just to look up like deep conversations on the internet. There would have been a vogue article about were not really friends and then you would have looked it up, you know. So in order to change your algorithm, you just have to change the things that youre looking for."
39,8.8552,9.089583333333334,spk_5,"But dont you think maybe like the algorithm in place is whats making it so dangerous because its like theyre pumping out these really terrible kind of like content videos. But also youve got like the attention economy where theyre like fighting to get your information  to then give to people like to put ads in your feed that you wont
 notice."
40,9.08975,9.2996,spk_0,"Even if youre not on social media, you know, its gonna do that anyway. Like if youre searching anything on, like if youre searching something up on safari and you go onto your computer onto Chrome, the ads will probably be the same, you know, its just,  its just technology,
 you know."
41,9.299766666666669,9.917,spk_1,"Um I sat down here saying that social media makes people antisocial. But hearing Alexa and Alex speak, it makes me remember that um social media isnt just, you know, the whole tiktok scene. Its also schools, theres clubs and stuff. Um Ive made a couple of new friends from social media because um they live in Ventura, I live in San Diego. So I dont think its necessarily just the whole big fame thing. Theres also the smaller group. Yeah. I, Id like to say social media changed my life. Im uh more confident. I actually think about what I wear. I used to just roll out bed, grab whats near. I do see how social media can be bad, but I, I like to think of it in a positive light."
42,9.93015,9.973,spk_6,I have been bullied on social media.
43,10.032666666666668,10.371,spk_4,"Mhm I know you guys remember like those musically days, I feel like that was my biggest bullying because its like when you, its just like entering a whole different society, its just like when youre going out, youre making videos, you dont really know what you wanna post or what you wanna do or what you wanna look like. So it is gonna be cringy at first and its not gonna be great.  Musically
 was definitely a dark time."
44,10.371166666666666,10.943483333333337,spk_0,"Um More recently, I did have a hate account on Instagram. They um like told me to kill myself and told me that like, because I was upset about my pet dying that I should kill myself. And that I like, was ugly and I looked like a clown and, yeah, I really, really, really let it get to me for a long time. But then I realized, you know, like, theyre only making fun of me because Im giving them attention about it. So I just had to, like, block them from all my accounts and block all the people they were following and block all the people that were following them and then I just had to stop looking. And if I dont look at it,  then I dont know what theyre saying.
 Right. And thats the thing."
45,10.94365,11.072566666666669,spk_4,"Its just like, once you stop looking into it, its, you just stop beating the fire and it will die eventually because  you just dont even pay it. No mind.
 I dont have a big following."
46,11.072733333333334,11.418566666666669,spk_3,"So its mostly, mostly people I know usually its Tik Toks and its not with my name in it, but you can tell that its implied towards me and I try not to comment but like, theres some points where theyre coming out and saying like, completely false things about me posting and hating on someone through the internet is completely different from in person because its there forever. You dont have control over that because its up to them to delete it."
47,11.465,11.833583333333332,spk_5,"So I have had rude comments been made about me, but Ive never been like, heavily cyberbullied because I dont really have a big following and because of the community that Im in, Ive just read hundreds of stories about kids who, like, felt like they wanted to kill themselves because of the rude comments they were getting. And I just remember like, there were nights when I,  I would cry and Id be so upset because I couldnt really do anything about
 it."
48,11.83375,12.998816666666666,spk_2,"My cyberbullying experience the first, like, big one I was in like this like dance team, right? And I was the shortest kid, the fattest kid and like one of like three Asians. So I clearly stuck out no matter what I did. And you know, like after practice, like all the girls would like do that like 2014 like ass out like like the duck face thing pose one day, like one of them like invited me to take the photo with them and I thought like this was the only way you could pose on Instagram. So like I did it and then they took the photo and they were all like laughing and they started uploading it. I didnt know why over like the next 2.5, 3 years, they would continuously like bring me into the photo. Like I would never just go up, theyd always ask me, hey, do you wanna be in the photo? Do you wanna be in the photo? So I felt like I was being included. But when I like got a phone and when I got on Instagram and when I started following like my fellow dance team members, I would look at their Instagrams and like from the beginning its photos of me. Theyll zoom in on me and theyll be like, look at that fat thing, that monster like, is it trying to pose? Like what is like, what does that thing think it is? Like, do they think theyre cute? I wasnt like elementary school. Like, I dont know how to deal with myself. Like I barely know how to open a peanut butter jar and you expect me to know how to deal with people calling me it and like a monster. You know what I mean?"

 themselves."
50,13.17865,13.479983333333331,spk_5,"Instagram, tiktok. Everything is the highlight reel. My Instagram, Im not gonna post the ugliest picture of me when I scroll to my friends, I in the back of my head, I should know that that, thats the same for them yet. Im like, they look so pretty. Why do I not look like that? And I think for younger generations its really scary  that theyre gonna have to deal with
 this."
51,13.48015,14.0625,spk_2,"I have this one photo thats so vivid in my memory and like Im at like an aquarium and Im leaning against like one of the fish tanks and my dad and my dad and my brother are next to me and Im like half my brothers height, my face sagging my body like my clothes dont fit on me. And Im like, at that time I didnt realize how depressed I was and how, how much these, like, these, like, dance photos were ruining me. Thats kind of when I knew like, social media is not something I like, Im not safe here, you know, and so an excuse I can make for not pleasing people online is that I dont use it and then Ill be ok."
52,14.0755,14.35915,spk_4,"The thing, the bad thing about social media is like, if you have a bad friend in real life and your moms like, avoid them, dont be next to them and stuff. But on social media, you almost cant avoid them. And I feel like thats where like a lot, a lot of kids can get hurt because they common root things on your things or they dont share the same opinions and those friends are horrible.  You know, I dont
 know how Tumblr is now because I dont go on it,"
53,14.359316666666668,14.584833333333334,spk_0,"but there are a lot of like self harm pages and eating sort of pages with like ideas to make yourself lose weight. Theres so much of that on Tumblr that I had to get off of Tumblr. Um And I think that definitely will hurt kids now and in the future,"
54,14.584983333333334,14.783333333333331,spk_4,"I just cant imagine being like 10 or 11 or 12 just being so young and looking through this and taking all these suggestions in, Im 18 now, like I go through it and I know better. But I feel like you could get seriously hurt when  youre young because you really just dont know any
 better."
55,14.786316666666666,15.166316666666669,spk_1,"Yeah. Ill just play back on what you said about how little kids dont know better. I saw a hack where it was like scoop ice cream and it said microwave the spoon. Most, most Children wouldnt know. Yeah. In cases like that it does hurt me to be pro social media. But social media, I, I think it was always more intended for more discretion.  Like I, I have
 this friend named Jessie Page and she is very,"

Thats why I keep all my posts up because I want people to be able to go back and look I wasnt on t for three years, you know, when I was out, you know, like I was fully out and like fighting for myself to start hormones. My friend Jessie too, she also puts before and after she always puts like this is the real me. Do you think"

And the main point that they try to get across is that theyre trying to advocate for kids to get cell phones and technology and social media at an older age. Um, and, you know, years ago I would have said thats really stupid. Thats like the drug talk, like, dont do drugs, dont be on social media. Im not gonna listen to that. But then after years of kind of self reflection, I wish someone would have said you dont need Instagram to have a social  life
 if I go back to like my 13 year old self and like,"

So I just feel like if anything, it helped me more when I was 13, like it really allowed me to just know what things were and not be so what is going on.  Like, you know, not knowing a lot of things
 because like, I was on social media,"

I was probably like the last couple of people out of my like friends because my mom knew the restrictions and how the things that are on the internet is. You cant control what other people are posting and you cant control what your kids are seeing.

67,17.86116666666667,18.184166666666663,spk_5,"Its difficult because I, I do think what you said is true where if I was 13 and someone said you have to be 13 to get on this app or you or like you have to be older, I would have lied about my, my age and I know there are millions of kids like that that are like, he, he, he break the system and be, like, put in a different age.

 thats the thing with any problem."

 computer lab days exist."

I know some people that kind of think, like, when I say that I dont use social media a lot, theyre like, oh, do you think youre cooler than us because you dont need, like, social media validation?

I know all schools they dont talk about some deep topics that social media brings to light and it teaches you and it teaches you how to get through it and how to do it without talking to your family if you are uncomfortable and without talking to the school because sometimes schools dont have that education in place.

 teacher told everyone"

Of course, like I got in trouble for like, correcting him or whatever, but it was like, I could not let him spread fake information like that. Those are not trans people, those are drag queens.

75,19.851233333333333,19.97958333333333,spk_1,"And then the fact that you even got in trouble for that shows that school is that like, you know, theyre lacking,  you
 know, personal experience is how you learn the most, you know,"
76,19.979750000000003,20.1309,spk_4,"you go on social media and theres someone talking about this eating disorder, this depression that they went to. Its just someone actually talking to a camera giving you real advice that a school really can never do."
77,20.1795,20.74858333333333,spk_5,"I wanna preface it with. I am kind of like, Im very lucky. Um The school that I go to Altamont is like a private school in Alabama and theyre very, very good with kind of integrating these conversations into the academic dialogue. I, I totally agree with everything yall have said. Ive learned how to Rainbow Loom and Ive done a bunch of different things on social media but Ive also looked up like election and theres been misinformation after misinformation and with COVID. So for yall that answered, how do you, how you kind of outweigh like the chance to learn a bunch of new things, but also the chance of seeing a lot of stuff that isnt necessarily true.  I
 think you just have to look for credible websites."
78,20.74875,20.9514,spk_4,"I mean, its just like when youre doing an essay, you wouldnt believe. I, I just feel like blogs, any of that kind of stuff. It is easy to get a lot of misinformation, but its also easy to see that this information is fake.  Like, but
 what about like a young kid that cant really discern that?"
79,20.95156666666667,20.9659,spk_5," Because I feel like
 thats the,"
80,20.966066666666663,21.14065,spk_0,"my dad actually um put the Washington Post and the New York Times on my phone so that I would look at it more. So I would get the notifications, you know, all I had to do was put it on my phone."
81,21.142166666666665,21.352666666666668,spk_5,"There have been times when Ive disagreed with what the teacher said and that that is true. But I also think that with social media, with the algorithm in place, its harder to harder like to discern,  I disagree with you
 just because I feel like as kids,"
82,21.352833333333333,21.46933333333333,spk_3,"we look up to our teachers for the right answers and if they are like providing like a bias answer,  were getting the wrong information.
 If youve taken"
83,21.473666666666663,21.654066666666665,spk_1,"a science class there will be times where the teachers own political beliefs might make the learning bias so comparable to social media. Its about the same. Yeah.  But I
 think its more dangerous on social media because I,"
84,21.65425,21.8534,spk_5,"I agree it is very dangerous in the classroom, especially when you look up to teachers with the algorithm. They dont have that humanity for to like to actually discern like, oh, this is an article about how masks arent important. So like, but Im gonna pump that out."
85,21.8599,22.15148333333333,spk_4,"But I would just, I would disagree with you for that exact reason because because its just one human, one way of life, one perspective, one thought, you know, but at least when you go on social media and you put up Trump, its gonna come up both sides of the story, you know, when its up to you to differentiate and read it and see, OK,  this comes from this credible website and this is coming from a blog on
 Wikipedia."
86,22.15165,22.32415,spk_1,"What if were talking about like, just a straightforward thing like math science or English? Sometimes you can get like a cruddy teacher and they wont really teach you that. Well, you just type that into social media. They ring it. Ive never"
87,22.32583333333333,22.56758333333333,spk_4,"like, Ive never been held by a math teacher. I mean, photo math was the only thing that helped me. I mean, and its not even like it only gave me the answers. I mean, you saw like you scrolled up and it literally shows you step by step what it does and you look for the reasoning, heres the reasoning.  And sometimes
 if I have a lot of trouble with like an assignment or something,"
88,22.567733333333333,22.7679,spk_0,"Ill actually like post a picture of it and Ill be like, hey, like I am really bad in this subject. Every single time people do message me and help me out or like we comment and be like, hey, like actually this is what youre doing wrong and this is how you do it right?"
89,22.788816666666666,22.909983333333333,spk_6,Society would thrive without social. I dont know if we
90,22.96848333333333,23.307,spk_5,"for me on a macro scale, I think there are some really um troubling signs that social media is kind of unwinding society and humanity in the sense of like the democracy debate, governments can use social media to then kind of undermine elections. Um And I think those are bigger issues when you look at the macro scale. But again, on the micro scale,  there are so many different people in the world that
 would thrive with it."
91,23.307166666666667,23.54758333333333,spk_3,"I know other people that are like me, I think I would thrive more without social media because I kind of I compare myself and I look for those likes and look for those comments on my posts. And I feel like if I didnt have that concern my mental health and my self love and self image would be so much better if I didnt see all this stuff on the internet."
92,23.54775,24.330166666666667,spk_2,"But part of me wants to ask for like a def a definition for like thrive because like, are we talking about like us as like a human race or like people individually Instagram and things and like put like make you have poor body image and this that but also like in the case of like Alex, you know, it helps him, you know, meet other trans people and understand that like he isnt alone, right? And so it, its such a general question with so many variables that like you cant just like put one answer down. Yeah,  you need so
 case by case you need to know if its on the micro macro scale and you know, like Alex is a following that is a lot of other trans kids that are looking for other trans kids and if Alex just went mi a for a month, people would panic, you know, and like, you know, like I can totally like, sorry to like keep using you but like, like this is like the easiest like, like analogy, right? Im sorry, Alex, I love it. I was  like, this is just like the
 easiest example."
93,24.33333333333333,24.609483333333333,spk_0,"Um I have a question actually. Um so I, in the recent months, especially there have been a lot of protests and stuff that were like a lot of them were created online and I think that if we didnt have social media, a lot of them wouldnt have been possible because there wouldnt have been the word spread so fast."
94,24.60965,25.02615,spk_2,"I, I agree. Yes. These protests got really big and its really important. But I, the thing that Ive kind of been looking at is the people that go and take a picture and they like, oh my God, like, I, Im so supportive and like, they change their profile picture. They do the blackout Tuesday and then a week later it gets archived when people go with like professional grade cameras and like bring a hair and makeup team to like sit there and like pose in the middle of the street.  Like its less of the movement and more of the social
 media and yeah,"
95,25.026316666666663,25.50933333333333,spk_4,"and I think thats also a perspective thing because I think there was maybe one or two major influencers who were dumb enough to take a production team out there to take a picture. And I think that was for people like you guys who are antisocial media to focus be like, wow, see, look at all these influencers. Its the whole entire community is just like them. And I was in New York for a couple of days and I was in like Washington Square or something. They were passing out flyers like, hey, share this on your Snapchat if you know anyone in New York and I wasnt only in New York for like two days, but I posted it and I got like, I dont know, like 40,000 people on Snapchat to watch it and be, and if they were in New York,  they could
 go by these like, performative parts."
96,25.50948333333333,25.7965,spk_2,"Im not talking, only influencers like, yes, that is a big part. And it is very troublesome when influencers do, like, kind of go out and like, pose for like the picture rather than for the protest. But when people kind of seeing like, oh, this is trendy and when people have that desire to like go viral,  theyll go out and theyll do
 it."
97,25.79715,26.1155,spk_1,"But heres like a scenario. What if um me, Alex, I mean, Alex, Alex and Alexa, we all just teamed up, we did like a charity stream and then donated to, lets say, lets, lets just throw back to like early 2020 whether it was like fires wouldnt California or Australia thrive from us donating."
98,26.12366666666667,26.288,spk_3,"I do agree that um social media does like, promote awareness and it helps change and definitely in our societies, everyones on social media. So if they see this and it gets spread, its gonna make change. Yeah."
99,26.288166666666665,26.54748333333333,spk_5,"And thats kind of why I made like the log off movement is because I saw that there was this multifaceted nature about social media and at least just wanted to discuss it with teens and to be like, lets figure out how to exist in a healthier way. And um even though social media, we can talk about the good and the bad all day, its just nice to be in one space and have one conversation."
100,26.54765,26.62983333333333,spk_2,"I mean, yeah, technically, social media did bring us here. So I guess thats a good thing. Like, hey, we dont have to talk about that."
101,26.73433333333333,27.055983333333334,spk_7,"Hi, everyone. Wish you a very happy New Year and hope you enjoyed this episode. I personally struggle a lot with my social media usage. So recently I bought an alarm clock so that the phone is not the first thing I look at in the morning and Im not tempted to go on social media if you have any suggestions as to how you control your social media usage, feel free to leave in the comments section below.
