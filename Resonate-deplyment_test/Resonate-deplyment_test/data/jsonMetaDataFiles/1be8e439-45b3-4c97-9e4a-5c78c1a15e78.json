    "meeting_summary": "This meeting was about the working design of the new remote control. First, the group discussed the three presentations from the three team members: from the group's point of view, from the user interface's perspective, and from the industrial design's perspective. They agreed that they should make the product only for TV and that the corporate image should be the final thing to be added to the product. Then, the team discussed the project requirements: the design of components, system, and interface design. The group agreed that the product should be only for television and should be priced at twelve and a half Euros."
